The material facts, as set forth in the bill, were these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 12th day of September, 1851, Wheeler, Sage, and Slocum entered into an equal copartnership, to carry on 'a <i>general produce business</i>' in Troy, New York. The firm became the owner of a large debt against Alanson Sweet, of Milwaukee, which was secured by mortgage on valuable real estate. Proceedings to foreclose were commenced in October, 1854, and a decree passed in November, 1855. Sweet was insolvent, with heavy judgments against him. The parties were desirous of getting a perfect title to the mortgaged premises, their value being, when the mortgage was given, $50,000. In order to do this, it was thought necessary that certain judgments should be purchased and other arrangements perfected, which Sage informed Wheeler and Slocum could be done through a certain Alexander Mitchell, for $10,000. Sage was authorized to perfect the agreement, and to charge Wheeler and Slocum their proportionate amount on the books of the firm. This agreement, or a similar one, was made by Sage with Mitchell, and judgments purchased under it. Without the knowledge of Wheeler, Sage, however, abandoned this agreement, and made one with Mitchell for his own benefit. The mortgaged property was sold, and Mitchell became the purchaser, letting Sage have one-third interest on certain conditions; this being done, as alleged, in violation of the rights and without the knowledge of Wheeler and Slocum. The mortgage debt was fixed at $24,000, two-thirds of which amount was paid over by Sage to Wheeler and Slocum, being, as he said, the best that could be done, and which was accepted by Wheeler and Slocum on that hypothesis. Enough of the mortgaged property, the bill alleged, had been sold to produce $105,000, leaving unsold what was worth $27,000. The prayer of the bill was, that Sage might be declared to be trustee for Wheeler for one-third of the mortgaged property still held and unsold by Mitchell, and for one-third of the proceeds of what had been sold; and be decreed to account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sage, in his answer, admitted that the firm was desirous of becoming the owner in fee of the premises mortgaged, and that it was thought by an expenditure of $10,000 that the object could be attained; and that an arrangement to this effect was contemplated with Mitchell, but became impracticable, and was abandoned: that Mitchell controlled the defence, which was serious and complicated, and it was feared by Wheeler that it might so far prevail as to lessen the amount of the mortgage debt. After considerable negotiation, a basis of settlement was agreed to by the partners and Mitchell, which fixed the amount due on the mortgage at $24,000. The defence was withdrawn, and a decree entered (at the instance of Mitchell) for $33,000, which was to be discharged on the payment of $24,000 by Mitchell, or at his election the decree was to be assigned to him. Mitchell preferred a sale to cut off an intervening claim. Sage admitted that, after the sale, he became interested in one-third of the property, but denied that Wheeler and Slocum have ever had, or were ever entitled to any interest whatever therein, and averred that when the sale was made there was no subsisting agreement or understanding other than that said Mitchell should pay the amount agreed upon at the time of sale. The answer also denied that the mortgaged premises were of the value stated in the bill, and insisted that enough had not been realized from their sale to pay Sage the sum of $24,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A general replication was filed, and proofs were taken. In regard to the plan of getting a 'perfect title' to the premises, it appeared by these that Sweet had about <i>thirty different judgment creditors</i> (Mitchell holding a judgment for $18,556.04, and the remaining creditors, exclusive of the Troy firm, for $59,597.73); that the principal item of the mortgaged premises was a <i>warehouse</i>, valued, when the mortgage was given, at $50,000, but of which the rise in value had been so great, that when the bill was filed it had come to be valued by some persons at twice that sum. The firm, accordingly, did not want to receive their money and interest under the proceeding to foreclose, but wanted to get the warehouse itself; of which, indeed, they had been for some time in possession, and which they were now actually occupying, with apparent exercise of ownership. But there were difficulties in the case. Sweet thought that with the rise of this property, which would occur by a railroad about to be made near it,&#8212;the Lake Shore Railroad,&#8212;he would be able to reinstate his affairs, and his judgment creditors looked to the same possibility as the means of at least getting the amount of their debts. Sweet accordingly threatened to redeem; and the creditors were watching the course of events. The object of Wheeler, Sage, and Slocum was, therefore, to get the warehouse itself under their mortgage, and for no more, or for little more, than its principal and interest. The operation was to be performed, in part, by buying in certain judgments at a discount, and in part by securing Sweet's acquiescence, in virtue of a consideration, to their getting a decree as speedily as possible, and an arranged sort of sale on foreclosure. The following extracts, or parts or copies of letters, selected from a large number in the record, give an idea of the process. The firm, it appeared, was represented in Troy by Messrs. Sage (M. C.) &amp; Slocum, as R. Sage &amp; Co.; and in Milwaukee by Mr. Wheeler, as Wheeler &amp; Co.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>[WHEELER TO SAGE.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MILWAUKEE, October 11, 1853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MESSRS.

I remarked to him that it would be no object to him to redeem, as his judgment-creditors would take it all from him again. He said he knew it, but in all human probability he should defend. I remarked that his services might be worth something to you in perfecting title, but no such sum as he named. I think if you can secure his quietness, that you would be safe from any creditors.

Wheeler says subsequently, at different dates: 'I think there is a game, an intrigue in the defence, against the warehouse property. There may be a collision of parties that we little expect . . . <i>Sweet is ugly</i>, and is determined to make you all the trouble he can;' 'is trying to make some defence in your chancery suit of warehouse property; is around amongst the warehouse men making inquiries what it is worth.' 'These chancery suits are long-winded.' 'There is no earthly doubt but that the warehouse property is worth $50,000; nor but that it would sell for that now.' 'The property is variously estimated from $50,000 to $100,000.'

It may be mentioned as a preliminary objection that the complainant has never offered to refund the money received from Sage. If Wheeler would take advantage of Sage's contract with Mitchell, he must take it in whole, and exactly as Sage made it. He should not be permitted to hold us in a lawsuit, and to speculate upon the chances of prospective value of what Sage received from Mitchell.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The bill of complaint itself states in the outset that the partners were engaged in 'a general produce business.' Admit that the mortgage debt was treated as a partnership adventure. What then? The partnership gained thereby no interest in the mortgaged <i>premises</i>. The complainant assumes that with the ownership of the <i>debt</i> the firm acquired a vested interest in the real estate by which it was secured, and a right to 'secure a perfect title;' but this is not so. When Sage had collected the debt, and accounted for it, there all agency ceased. He might, during the existence of the copartnership, have acquired in his own right the equity of redemption, without violating any legal duty or trust springing from his relation as a copartner. His contract, therefore, with Mitchell for an interest in the premises&#8212;whether before or after the foreclosure sale&#8212;was no breach of his obligation as a partner. He could in his own right have become a purchaser at the sale, paying down, of course, the mortgage-moneys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. If the complainant has established any theory by his bill and proofs, it is that the firm of Wheeler &amp; Co. aimed at purchasing title to the mortgaged premises, not by paying the value of them, or what they would bring by fair competition at public sale, but by combination tending to outvie or deceive other creditors, and to repress rivalry and competition. That courts will refuse relief in such a case is undeniable. <i>Randall</i> v. <i>Howard</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in this court, is in point, and the authorities show that the refusal will be made under almost any variation of circumstances that can be conceived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Mr. Carpenter, contra:</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The objection that in his bill the complainant did not offer to pay back the sum which Sage paid him at the time of the sale, as his proportion of the money secured by the mortgage, is a technical objection only; one to the frame of the bill; and can be taken advantage of only by demurrer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The bill states that Sage has received under said contract with Mitchell much more than the amount paid by him to Wheeler, and it is for his proportion of that surplus that Wheeler brings this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. We may admit that the proper business of the partnership was dealing in produce, and not in purchasing real estate. Still a purchase of real estate which had been mortgaged gaged to the firm, for a produce debt, or of which the mortgage came into the firm as cash assets, was quite within its sphere. The purchase was by way of protection; and the estate was to come into the firm, <i>incidentally</i> only. The question then is, whether in such a case, <i>i. e.</i> where one partner has been <i>intrusted</i> by his copartners as agent of the firm to purchase on joint account, and on joint account has undertaken so to buy, he can, in good conscience, carry on a long operation, corresponding with his confiding partners in a most confidential way, and then, when he sees the path clear to a profitable operation, dismiss those copartners&#8212;copartners, in this special operation, independently of all general relations&#8212;and put the profits into his own pocket? We submit that he cannot. As the agent of his copartners, Sage's relation was a highly fiduciary one, and he must not abuse it to his own benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. We admit, too, the general rule of law, that where a bill seeks to enforce a contract which rests in illegality, or which was entered into to defraud others, the court will not hear the parties, and thus give effect to an illegal agreement. Such was the case of <i>Randall</i> v. <i>Howard</i>, in this court, cited on the other side. But when a defendant is called to an accounting in a court of equity <i>for breach of trust</i>, he is never permitted to set up that the fund was created in some illegal way. In <i>Barney</i> v. <i>Saunders</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> this court compelled a trustee to account for usurious interest, illegally taken by him on the trust fund. This, then, is not a case where the Hon. Mr. Sage can make infamy his shield, and by setting up this defence, sacrifice his character for a money 'equivalent.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to recover is placed mainly on two grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>First</i>. That Sage, in the absence of any agreement, could not by private treaty become interested in the mortgaged property, to the exclusion of the other partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second</i>. That there was an agreement that Sage should act as the agent of his copartners in perfecting the title to the mortgaged premises; and having violated his agreement and made a private bargain with Mitchell for his individual benefit, he is chargeable as trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each partner is the agent of his copartners in all transactions relating to partnership business, and is forbidden to traffic therein for his own advantage, and if he does, will be held accountable for all profits. But beyond the line of the trade or business in which the firm is engaged, there is no restraint on his right to traffic. As one partner has no authority to bind the firm outside of their ordinary business, he cannot of course be held liable to account, should he make a profitable adventure in a matter not legitimately connected with the business of the firm. The difficulty generally is, to ascertain what acts are within the scope of the particular trade or business. But in this case there is no embarrassment whatever in the application of the principle. This was a partnership to do a general produce business. It contemplated no dealings in real estate, and each partner was at liberty to buy and sell real estate, and was under no legal liability to account to his copartners. The debt due from Sweet belonged to the partnership, and not the premises mortgaged. To the extent of their debt the partners had an interest in the mortgaged property, and no further. They were interested to have the debt paid, not to procure title to the mortgaged property. It can readily be seen that it would be profitable to get a real estate worth $50,000 for $34,000; but <i>how</i> an engagement to do a general produce business could embrace that speculation is not so apparent. Sage's legal relations to his copartners extended to the procurement of the money due from Sweet. They were neither more nor less. But it is said that the copartners were desirous, if possible, of obtaining the title to the mortgaged premises, and that Sage undertook the negotiation for them, and made an effective arrangement with Mitchell, which he afterwards relinquished, and secured clandestinely an advantage to himself, to the injury of the other partners, and should, therefore, be held to account for profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case, consisting mainly of letters interchanged between Wheeler and Sage, shown clearly enough that a scheme was initiated to get the title to the property, and that Sage was the active agent to perfect it, but for some unexplained reason it failed. The evidence does not prove that Sage made a contract with his copartners to perfect the title, but his engagement was to consummate a contract with Mitchell, if it could be done, by which the object could be accomplished. All parties rested in the belief that the negotiations with Mitchell would be successful; but from some motive not disclosed in the record, Sage abandoned the idea of buying the property on joint account, and bargained with Mitchell in his own behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, when a party obtains an advantage by fraud, he is to be regarded as the trustee of the party defrauded, and compelled to account. But if a party seeks relief in equity, he must be able to show that on his part there has been honesty and fair dealing. If he has been engaged in an illegal business and been cheated, equity will not help him. 'The Warehouse Case,' as it is somewhere called in the record, is anything but to the parties concerned, and it is surprising that they should have been willing to give publicity to it through a legal proceeding. Sweet was an insolvent debtor, owing Sage, Wheeler &amp; Slocum $24,000, secured on real estate in Milwaukee, which was worth, when the security was given, $50,000, and over $100,000 when the bill in this case was filed. In 1854 and 1855, when the scheme to perfect the title was in full progress, the property was appreciating in value. Judgments had been entered against Sweet in favor of Mitchell to the amount of $18,556.04, and in favor of various other creditors for the sum of $59,597.73. Suit to foreclose was commenced, and a vigorous defence interposed. Sweet denied that there was as much due on the mortgage as was set forth in the bill, and he claimed a share of the general business, and that he was entitled to a credit of $12,000 for the rent of the warehouse for three years, during which time it had been occupied by Wheeler &amp; Co. If this defence was successful, they could not hope to 'perfect the title.' The property was too valuable and the venture too great to lie idle and wait the ordinary progress of a suit in chancery. The property must be saved at all events and Sweet's peace bought. Wheeler writes to Sage, May 5, 1855: 'F. thinks if you can buy Sweet's peace, that the creditors of Sweet could be bluffed off, by getting a large decree and taking a proper time to sue it, and the price of Sweet's peace to be contingent to the final adjustment of title.' Again, under date of May 18, he writes to Sage, 'that if we do not make some arrangement with S. to stop the defence and let us have the decree at this term, we will have to take the money on the mortgage, as the property has risen in value more than 100 per cent. within the last two years, and we want you and Mr. Slocum to come out at once and do something.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To perfect the title' and grasp the coveted prize, the defence must be stopped, Sweet bought off, and the decree enlarged beyond the just sum, so as to 'bluff creditors.' The nearer the decree was to the actual value of the property, the less was the chance of being outbid. To pay value for the property was not embraced in the scheme, but if Sweet was silenced, there would be no difficulty of fixing the decree at a sum which would tend to repress competition, and the decree was actually made for the sum of $33,000, when the amount due was only $24,000. It is true that Sage, in his answer, says that Mitchell had this done from motives of his own. But the correspondence between Wheeler and Sage abundantly proves, that to get a decree for the nominal instead of the real amount due on the mortgage, was one of the main parts of their project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was imposed on, and a combination formed, the object and direct tendency of which was to secure the title to the valuable real estate of an insolvent debtor, at the expense and sacrifice of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A proceeding like this is against good conscience and good morals, and cannot receive the sanction of a court of equity.
