This supplemental decree relates only to the bed of the Red River, and to lands bordering on the north side of the same, between the 98th meridian of west longitude and the mouth of the North Fork.</p>\n<p>2. The several interveners who, under patents or Indian allotments by the United States, own lands bordering on the north side of the river are severally the owners of so much of the bed of the river as lies in front of their lands and north of the medial line of the river, except as is otherwise stated herein.</p>\n<p>3. Where, under grants from the United States, the State of Oklahoma owns lands bordering on the north side of the river the State has the same riparian rights in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> the river bed that an individual owning the same lands under a patent or Indian allotment would have.</p>\n<p>4. The full title and ownership of so much of the bed of the river as lies south of its medial line are in the United States.</p>\n<p>5. In the sense intended herein, the medial line of the river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks, save that, under a stipulation between the parties affected, to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall be regarded and treated as falling no farther north than the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were patented or allotted.</p>\n<p>6. Where tracts on the north side of the river, which were not riparian when surveyed, were patented or allotted after they had become riparian, such disposals carried the title to the medial line of the river, unless other tracts between them and that line had been disposed of theretofore, in which event the later disposals did not carry any right in, or affect the title to, such intervening tracts.</p>\n<p>7. Where tracts on the north side, which had come to be in the river bed after survey and before disposal, were patented or allotted as if they were upland, while the adjacent land behind them which was then actually riparian was as yet unsold and unallotted, such disposals carried the title to the medial line of the river, unless other tracts between them and that line had been disposed of theretofore, in which event the later disposals did not carry any right in, or affect the title to, such intervening tracts.</p>\n<p>8. The patenting and allotting of lands bordering on the north side of the river did not carry or give any right to islands in the river which were in existence at that time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> 9. The patent issued for lot 1 of section 35 in township 4 south of range 14 west, under which the intervener E. Everett Rowell is now claiming, carried the right and title to the river bed between such lot and the medial line of the river.</p>\n<p>10. The patent issued for lots 1 and 2 of section 8 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners A.E. Pearson, et al., are now claiming, carried the right and title to the river bed between such lots and the medial line of the river.</p>\n<p>11. The patent issued for the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter of section 7 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners A.E. Pearson, et al., are now claiming, invested the patentee with the full ownership of the land within the limits of that tract as shown on the plat of the official survey, but did not carry any right or title to any part of the river bed as an incident to the disposal of that tract.</p>\n<p>12. The patent issued for lots 6 and 7 of section 7 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners Robert L. Owen, et al., are now claiming, carried the right and title to the river bed between such lots and the medial line of the river.</p>\n<p>13.
