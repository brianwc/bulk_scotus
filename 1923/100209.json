We are of opinion that 'legally      diverted' means not a future diversion, but one now being      exercised under a legal right, and that under this statute a      legal abstractor may take what he was diverting in 1907, and,      if that did not reach the statutory maximum of exemption, as      much more as is required to make the total diversion one      hundred gallons per day per capita for each of the      municipalities supplied, without payment of the license fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If, in 1907, the daily diversion exceeded one hundred      gallons per capita, the amount then diverted, if lawful, may      be taken without payment, and if it was less, no license fee      can be imposed until it exceeds the statutory quantity.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleged that under the provisions of this act the city was 'permitted to divert * * * an average daily free allowance of water to the amount of 36,241,666 gallons, the said last mentioned amount being the amount of water which was being diverted by said municipality on June 17th aforesaid, the date when the act aforesaid became effective and operative,' and claimed for each of the years subsequent to July 1, 1914, a license fee of $1 per million gallons for the excess of the daily average diversion of water over the quantity above specified. The answer alleged that prior to the passage of the act of 1907, the city had acquired a plant capable of furnishing 50,000,000 gallons of water per day, and set up certain separate defenses. At the trial, the court on motion of the state, struck out the separate defenses; the facts were not in controversy, and judgment was given for the amount claimed. About the same time, the state also recovered judgment against the city of Trenton for the license fee imposed by the same act. Both cases were taken to the Court of Errors and Appeals, the highest court of the state, and there by one decision the judgments were affirmed. 117 Atl. 158. That court said: 'The facts are not in dispute. It is conceded that the           city of Trenton, at the time of the enactment of the act           of 1907, was taking from the Delaware rive  daily           14,200,000 gallons of water for local use, and that the           city of Newark was daily extracting from the Pequannock           river 36,241,666 gallons for local use.

It is suggested that cities less populous by one-half than Newark, but owning plants far in excess of their needs might have diverted on June 17, 1907, twice the amount of water which the city of Newark diverted, and that a city twice as large might have diverted half as much, and the former of such cities would thereby have procured an almost perpetual exemption, and the latter would have brought on itself an insupportable burden of indefinite duration; and that accidents of climate, of conflagrations and of breaks in the mains on the critical date, June 17, 1907, would have resulted in increasing the exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enforcement by the state of the provision of the act imposing upon the city the specified annual payments for such diversion of water does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
