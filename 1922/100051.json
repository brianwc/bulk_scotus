Duarte, who described himself therein as the duly accredited consul general of the republic of Portugal in the United States of America, without more. The petition sets out the proceedings below; declares 'the Portuguese government does not intend to avoid its just obligations to citizens of the United States, but it claims that, if there is any question between it and such citizens, they are matters for adjudication by the diplomatic departments of the two governments, and it does object to the violation of its sovereignty, contrary to all rules of international law and international comity'; and alleges, as one reason for granting the writ, that 'an important question of international law and comity is involved.' There is nothing to show that the consul general had authority or right to take any action concerning the matters in question, except as may be inferred from his official position. Considering the possible international aspect of the controversy, we granted the petition, and appropriate writs issued.

In each cause, after arrest of the steamer, the Transportes Maritimos do Estado, intervening for its interest, appeared before the court and made claim, averring that it was in possession when the process issued, and was the true and bona fide owner. It asked to defend accordingly, gave bond for costs and value, and secured the vessel's discharge. Thereafter the steamer answered, denying the allegations of the libel, and as a distinct and complete defense alleged that it was owned and operated by the Transportes Maritimos do Estado, a department of the government of Portugal not subject to suits in courts of the United States. This special defense was declared insufficient and final decrees were duly entered. Appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were dismissed (The Carlo Poma, 255 U. S. 219, 41 Sup. Ct. 309, 65 L.

The Murmugao was attached. The respondents answered, made general denials, and, as a distinct and complete defense, alleged the Cunene and the Santo Antao were owned and operated bya department of the sovereign and operated by a department of the sovereign court was therefore without jurisdiction.

The consul general was not party to any of the proceedings below, and is not competent, merely by virtue of his office, to appear here for his government and claim immunity from process in the manner attempted. In The Anne, 3 Wheat. 435, 445 (4 L. Ed. 428), a prize proceeding for condemnation, a claim was interposed in behalf of the Spanish consul for restitution of the vessel because of asserted violation of the neutral territory of Spain. Speaking through Mr. Justice Story, this court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And this brings us to the second question in the cause; and      that is, whether it was competent for the Spanish counsel,      merely by virtue of his office, and without the special      authority of his government, to interpose a claim in this      case for the assertion of the violated rights of his      sovereign. We are of opinion, that his office confers on him      no such legal competency. A consul, though a public agent is      supposed to be clothed with authority only for commercial      purposes. He has an undoubted right to interpose claims for      the restitution of property belonging to the subjects of his      own country; but he is not considered as a minister, or      diplomatic agent of his sovereign, intrusted, by virtue of      his office, with authority to represent him in his      negotiations with foreign states, or to vindicate his      prerogatives. There is no doubt, that his sovereign may      specially intrust him with such authority; but in such case      his diplomatic character is superadded to his ordinary      powers, and ought to be recognized by the government within      whose dominions he assumes to exercise it. There is no      suggestion, or proof, of any such delegation of special      authority in this case; and therefore we consider this claim      as asserted by an incompetent person, and on that ground it      ought to be dismissed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And see United States v.
