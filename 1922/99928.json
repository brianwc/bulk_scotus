The price fixed was $111,373; the time for completion 250 working days; with a forfeiture of $100 a day for each day's delay. The contract provided that for each day's delay 'in the execution of the work' caused 'through any fault' of the government one additional day was to be allowed for its completion; but 'that no claim shall be made or allowed for damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the' government. The right to make additions to or omissions from the work was reserved to the United States, allowance therefor to be determined by the supervising architect; and it was provided 'that no claim for damages on account of such changes or for anticipated profits shall be made or allowed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The work was entered upon promptly both at the factory in Philadelphia and at Washington. About a month thereafter the Secretary of the Treasury requested suspension of certain work, in view of contemplated changes, and notified the contractor that he would be entitled to 'one day additional for each day's delay caused by the government, as provided for by your contract.' Radical changes in plan were made. There was a suspension for 10 months of part of the work which had to be done in the building; and later another suspension was ordered. The whole work was not completed until 18 months after the expiration of the contract period. This delay was attributable mainly, if not wholly, to the government. To recover for the expenses and loss which resulted from this delay, as well as for extra work, this suit was brought in the Court of Claims. Judgment was entered for the value of the extra work; but the court, following its decision in Merchants' Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 40 Ct. Cl. 117, denied recovery for damages due to the suspension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal to this court was taken before our decision in Wells Bros.

The absence of such a provision in the contract here under consideration is mainly relied upon to distinguish this case. But here, as there, the contract provided that no claim shall be made or allowed for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States.
