That Red River is not a navigable stream in any part of its course within the State of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>2. That the State of Oklahoma did not in virtue of her admission into the Union as a State acquire any title to, or become the owner of, the bed of the part of Red River within her borders.</p>\n<p>3. That the State of Oklahoma has no title, right or interest in or to the part of the bed of Red River within her borders, save such as is incidental to her ownership of lands on the northerly bank of the river.</p>\n<p>4. That the intervener D.D.
