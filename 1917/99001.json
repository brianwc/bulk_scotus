Rep. 890, the railway of the defendant was a street railroad, and that therefore the defendant was not a 'common carrier by railroad' within the terms of the Act of 1908 as amended. That case dealt with a purely street railway in the streets of two cities, and the decision was that it was not a 'railroad' such as was intended to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, Comp. Stat. 1916, &#167; 8563]. The case is of negligible value in determining either the construction of the act we are considering in this case, or the classification of the defendant, which clearly enough is a suburban railroad common carrier of passengers within the scope of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, as is sufficiently decided by United States v. Baltimore &amp; O. S. W. R. Co. 226 U. S. 14, 57 L. ed. 104, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 5; Kansas City Western R. Co. v. McAdow, 240 U. S. 51, 60 L. ed. 520, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252, 11 N. C. C.

After all of the evidence had been introduced on the trial, the court, immediately before charging the jury, permitted the plaintiff to further amend the third and fourth counts of her declaration by adding to each the allegation that the negligence of the defendant resulted in 'conscious pain and suffering' to the deceased. To the allowing of this last amendment the defendant objected, and, the objection being overruled, excepted, and it thereupon answered the declaration as thus amended, pleading 'not guilty and the statute of limitations of two years.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The death of plaintiff's decedent occurred on July 8, 1913. This amendment was allowed on October 29, 1915, and it is urged that the effect of it was to allow the plaintiff to recover upon a claim that the deceased endured 'conscious pain and suffering,' which would not have been allowed without the amendment, and that such claim was barred by the provision of the Employers' Liability Act, that no action shall be maintained under it unless commenced within two years from the time the cause of action accrued. Before this last amendment the third and fourth counts of the declaration stated a case of negligence plainly within the terms of the Employers' Liability Act, and claimed damages for the death of deceased from injuries which the prior amendment alleged caused him to 'suffer intense pain.' Under these two counts as they then stood, testimony was admitted, without objection, tending to prove that the deceased suffered pain during the comparatively short interval between the time he was injured and when he lapsed into the period of unconsciousness which preceded his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen, the fourth count, before the amendment objected to, alleged that the injuries received caused the deceased to suffer 'intense pain,' and the added allegation is that the injuries caused him 'conscious pain and suffering.' The difference between the two, if there is any difference at all, is too elusive for application in the practical administration of justice, and the claim that this amendment added a new cause of action to the declaration is too fanciful for discussion. At most it was a slight elaboration of a probably sufficiently claimed element of damage, and the allowance of the amendment was well within the authority and the effect of Missouri, K. &amp; T. R.

To the allowing of this last amendment the defendant objected, and the objection being overruled excepted, and it thereupon answered the declaration as thus amended pleading \"not guilty and the statute of limitations of two years.\"</p>\n<p>The death of plaintiff's decedent occurred on July 8, 1913. This amendment was allowed on October 29, 1915, and it is urged that the effect of it was to allow the plaintiff to recover upon a claim that the deceased endured \"conscious pain and suffering,\" which would not have been allowed without the amendment, and that such claim was barred by the provision of the Employers' Liability Act, that no action shall be maintained under it unless commenced within two years from the time the cause of action accrued. Before this last amendment the third and fourth counts of the declaration stated a case of negligence plainly within the terms of the Employers' Liability Act and claimed damages for the death of deceased from injuries which the prior amendment alleged caused him to \"suffer intense pain.\" Under these two counts as they then stood, testimony was admitted, without objection, tending to prove that the deceased suffered pain during the comparatively short interval between the time he was injured and when he lapsed into the period of unconsciousness which preceded his death.</p>\n<p>As we have seen, the fourth count, before the amendment objected to, alleged that the injuries received caused the deceased to suffer \"intense pain\" and the added allegation is that the injuries caused him \"conscious pain and suffering.\" The difference between the two, if there is any difference at all, is too elusive for application in the practical administration of justice, and the claim that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*640</span> this amendment added a new cause of action to the declaration is too fanciful for discussion. At most it was a slight elaboration of a probably sufficiently claimed element of damage, and the allowance of the amendment was well within the authority and the effect of <i>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>Wulf,</i> 226 U.S. 570; <i>Illinois Surety Co.</i> v. <i>Peeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98654\"><a href=\"/opinion/98654/illinois-surety-co-v-united-states-ex-rel-peeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, and <i>Seaboard Air Line Ry.</i> v. <i>Renn,</i> 241 U.S. 290.</p>\n<p>A word will suffice for the claim remaining. The trolley pole against which plaintiff's decedent struck was shown to be considerably closer to the track than the other poles on the line and it is sufficient to say that the trial and appellate courts both found that the maintaining of such pole so close to the track that a conductor could not safely discharge the duties required of him, constituted evidence of negligence sufficient to justify submitting the case to the jury and with this conclusion we cordially agree.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the case was submitted to the jury in a comprehensive charge sufficiently favorable to the defendant and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE did not take part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*641</span>\n                            Order.\n              SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n                      OCTOBER TERM, 1916.\n<p><i>Order.</i>  It is ordered that General Order in Bankruptcy No. XXXII be amended so as to read as follows: Opposition to discharge or composition: A creditor opposing the application of a bankrupt for his discharge, or for the confirmation of a composition, shall enter his appearance in opposition thereto on the day when the creditors are required to show cause, and shall file a specification in writing of the grounds of his opposition within 10 days thereafter, unless the time shall be shortened or enlarged by special order of the judge.</p>\n<p>Promulgated June 4, 1917.</p>\n</div>", "id": 99001, "judges": "Clarke", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99001/", "sha1": "e902b537b77f3d40c85a592ed1a0fcb20752e957", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:45:55"}
