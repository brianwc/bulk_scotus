Gray, the appellant, claims the whole of the property. The appellees contest his title, and set up occupancy by themselves at the time of the purchase. The proceeding was begun in the probate court, where, after a hearing, the facts were found and a judgment entered in favor of the appellees, each for the part of the lot claimed by them respectively. Gray thereupon appealed to the district court of the territory. This, it was held, in <i>Cannon</i> v. <i>Pratt</i>, 99 U. S. 619, might be done. Afterwards the district court heard the cause and found the facts and stated its conclusions of law thereon, as required by the practice act of the territory. After the findings and conclusions were filed in the district court, the present appellees excepted on the ground that the facts as found were contrary to the evidence, and also because the court refused to find facts as requested by them. A motion was also made to set aside the findings and grant a new trial. This motion was overruled and judgment entered in favor of the claim of Gray. Thereupon the present appellees appealed to the supreme court, both from the refusal to grant a new trial and from the judgment. This was allowable under the practice act of the territory. The supreme court heard the case, reversed the judgment of the district court, and remanded the cause, with instructions to enter a judgment rejecting the claim of Gray and allowing the claims of the appellees. From this judgment of the supreme court Gray took the present appeal. The supreme court made no 'statement of the facts of the case in the nature of a special verdict,' as required by the act of April 7, 1874, <i>c.</i> 80, (1 Supp. Rev. St. 13;) and as that court must have set aside the findings of the district court in order to render the judgment it gave, there is nothing here which we can re-examine.

So, too, if there is a reversal and another judgment rendered on the facts as found.
