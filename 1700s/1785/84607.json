They contended, that, even admitting there had been an usurious contract between the parties to this suit, and Anne Gibbs; yet, as it did not appear that any part of the money had been paid, no penalty was incurred; for, the words of the act are, that no person shall receive or take. They said, likewise, that although the consideration of the bond was originally usurious, the act of Assembly did not make it void; but only worked a forfeiture to the value of the thing or money lent; and that, therefore, without going farther, if the defendant's cross action did not appear from his own stating well founded, it should not be made the instrument of delaying the plaintiff's satisfaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dallas asserted, that he was prepared to prove Gibbs had received a part of the money, and that therefore the Usury was complete. He argued, that if the original agreement be corrupt between all the parties, and so within the act, no colour would exempt it from the dangers of usury. 1 Brownl. 73. 2 And. 428. 49 Shep. Abr. 170.

That a second bond made after the forfeiture of a former, and conditioned for the receipt of interest according to the penalty of the forfeited bond, is within the statute. 1 Hawk. 248. 3 Keb. 142. That if a bond depends on some other deed, and that deed becomes void, the bond is void also. 2. Wils. 341. and that a fine levied, or a judgment suffered for the security of money in pursuance of an usurious contract, may be avoided by an averment of the corrupt agreement, as well as any paroll contract. 1 Hawk. 248. 3 Rol. 509. He said that the defendant did not wish to diminish the plaintiff's security, but only to obtain a cessation of proceedings 'till the illegal consideration of the bond was ascertained by the event of the cross action; that if the consideration was illegal by statute, it was void by the common law; and, consequently, that the defendant would then be entitled to recover form the plaintiff as much as was now taken in execution. 2.
