In London the proceeding is by plaint against the Defendant, supported by the oath of the Plaintiff. On this is founded the attachment and proceedings against the Garnishee; but no further proceeding is had against the Defendant till he enters special bail, and then a declaration is filed and a trial had in the usual way. The practice under our act is first to obtain judgment against the Defendant, then to file a declaration against him according to the nature of the demand; if in debt, the judgment stands for the sum declared for, without even an oath to support it; if in case, a writ of Inquiry issues for a Jury to ascertain the demand, and then the scire facias issues against the Garnishee. No actual Notice is given to the Defendant of the execution of the writ of Inquiry; his attendance is never expected, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> is in most cases impossible. It seems to be a mode adopted, not for a trial of the merits, but only to conform to the nature of an action on the case, which requires a Jury of Inquiry to ascertain the sum for which execution is to issue; and it may be considered as a proceeding to inform the conscience of the Court, in the room of the supposed oath in the action of debt. In its nature it appears to be an ex parte proceeding, and not within the reason of the rules in executing writs of Inquiry on Judgments by default; where the Defendant has regular notice, and has no other opportunity of making a defence.</p>\n<p>The attachment law, and all proceedings under it, suppose the Defendant to be an absent person, and he has, in truth, no day in Court, till he enters special bail, and thereby dissolves the attachment; or comes in afterwards, when the money is recovered from the Garnishee, to disprove the debt, which is done by a scire facias ad disprobandum debitum; in either of which cases, he puts the Plaintiff upon the legal proof of his demand, and is admitted to make a full defence. The right of making that defence before the Jury of Inquiry has no foundation either in the act or the practice under it.  The law supposes, from his absence, that he is then incapable of making a defence; and, for that reason, has afforded him ample time and opportunity afterwards to do it; nor does it accord with legal ideas, that he should have this opportunity of trying his cause, and also another afterwards upon entering special bail.</p>\n<p>It has been said, that notice of executing these writs of Inquiry has been usually set up in the Prothonotary's and Sheriff's Offices; and that this notice would be vain, if the party might not appear and make his defence. This practice of putting up notices, must have been introduced by the Gentlemen of the Law ex majore cautela. If it were a new case, we should perhaps think it nugatory; as a person abroad cannot be supposed to take notice of a paper put up in the office, which he could never fee. However, as it is the practice, it is proper it should be continued; and it may, at least, serve the purpose of giving the Garnishee, or the Attorney in fact, of the Defendant, an opportunity of knowing, and apolizing his constituent, of the nature of the Plaintiff's demand, that he may be prepared to defend himself against it.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we are of opinion, that the refusing to admit the Defendant in the attachment to produce his evidence before the Jury of Inquiry, is not a sufficient reason for setting aside the Inquisition.</p>\n<p>Rule discharged.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2381653, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2381653/", "sha1": "9ced3f5a8b96c8e5f85f68d2c45a52d0e5ee59f5", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T02:18:19.526496"}
