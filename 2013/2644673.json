Argued October 9, 2013—Decided December 3, 2013\nPetitioner Atlantic Marine Construction Co., a Virginia corporation,\n  entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management,\n  Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on a construction project. The\n  subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all\n  disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia. When a\n  dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of\n  Texas. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-\n  selection clause rendered venue “wrong” under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)\n  and “improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). In\n  the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the\n  Eastern District of Virginia under 28 U. S. C. §1404(a). The District\n  Court denied both motions. It concluded that §1404(a) is the exclu-\n  sive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to\n  another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of estab-\n  lishing that a transfer would be appropriate under §1404(a); and that\n  the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors,\n  only one of which was the forum-selection clause. After weighing those\n  factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.\n     The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marine’s petition for a writ of\n  mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under\n  §1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under\n  §1404(a). The court agreed with the District Court that §1404(a) is\n  the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that\n  points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3)\n  would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection\n  clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court\n2    ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n             COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after\n    conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by §1404(a).\nHeld:\n    1. A forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer\n under §1404(a), which provides that “[f]or the convenience of parties\n and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer\n any civil action to any other district or division where it might have\n been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have\n consented.” Pp. 4–11.\n       (a) Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when\n venue is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or “im-\n proper” depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case\n was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws. Title\n 28 U. S. C. §1391, which governs venue generally, states that\n “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law . . . this section shall govern\n the venue of all civil actions brought in” federal district courts.\n §1391(a)(1). It then defines districts in which venue is proper. See\n §1391(b). If a case falls within one of §1391(b)’s districts, venue is\n proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dis-\n missed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the parties’ contract\n contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case\n falls into one of the specified districts.\n    This conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue\n provisions, which reflects Congress’ intent that venue should always\n lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal ju-\n risdiction over the defendant. See §1391(b)(3). The conclusion also\n follows from this Court’s decisions construing the federal venue\n statutes. See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612; Stewart\n Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a\n court “wrong” or “improper” under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the\n clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under §1404(a),\n which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or\n to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipu-\n lation. Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the\n federal court system. When a forum-selection clause points to a state\n or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of\n forum non conveniens. Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doc-\n trine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another\n federal court. Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp.,\n 549 U. S. 422. For all other cases, parties may still invoke the resid-\n ual forum non conveniens doctrine. See id., at 430. Pp. 8–10.\n       (c) The Court declines to consider whether a defendant in a\n breach-of-contract action could obtain dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) if\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a\n  forum-selection clause. Petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss un-\n  der Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule’s application.\n  Pp. 10–11.\n     2. When a defendant files a §1404(a) motion, a district court should\n  transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\n  convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. No such excep-\n  tional factors appear to be present in this case. Pp. 11–17.\n        (a) Normally, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion must\n  evaluate both the private interests of the parties and public-interest\n  considerations. But when the parties’ contract contains a valid\n  forum-selection clause, that clause “represents [their] agreement as to\n  the most proper forum,” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31, and should be “given\n  controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases,” id., at 33\n  (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The presence of a valid forum-selection\n  clause requires district courts to adjust their usual §1404(a) analysis\n  in three ways. First, the plaintiff’s choice of forum merits no weight,\n  and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has\n  the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the\n  parties bargained is unwarranted. Second, the court should not con-\n  sider the parties’ private interests aside from those embodied in the\n  forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests. Because\n  public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practi-\n  cal result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in un-\n  usual cases. Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause\n  flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a\n  §1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue’s\n  choice-of-law rules. See Van Dusen, supra, at 639. Pp. 12–16.\n        (b) Here, the District Court’s application of §1404(a) did not com-\n  port with these principles. The court improperly placed the burden\n  on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties’ contractually\n  preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the\n  party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that\n  public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer. It also\n  erred in giving weight to the parties’ private interests outside those\n  expressed in the forum-selection clause. And its holding that public\n  interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract\n  law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Vir-\n  ginia rested in part on the District Court’s mistaken belief that\n  the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas’\n  choice-of-law rules instead of Virginia’s.

We reject petitioner’s\nargument that such a clause may be enforced by a motion\nto dismiss under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Instead, a forum-\nselection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer\nunder §1404(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V), which provides that\n“[f ]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the\ninterest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil\naction to any other district or division where it might have\nbeen brought or to any district or division to which all\nparties have consented.” When a defendant files such a\nmotion, we conclude, a district court should transfer the\ncase unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\nconvenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. In\nthe present case, both the District Court and the Court of\nAppeals misunderstood the standards to be applied in\nadjudicating a §1404(a) motion in a case involving a forum-\n2   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

Atlantic\nMarine then entered into a subcontract with respondent\nJ-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on\nthe project. This subcontract included a forum-selection\nclause, which stated that all disputes between the parties\n“ ‘shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of\nNorfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.’ ” In re\nAtlantic Marine Constr. Co., 701 F. 3d 736, 737–738 (CA5\n2012).\n    When a dispute about payment under the subcontract\narose, however, J-Crew sued Atlantic Marine in the West-\nern District of Texas, invoking that court’s diversity ju-\nrisdiction. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss the suit,\narguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue in\nthe Western District of Texas “wrong” under §1406(a) and\n“improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).\nIn the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the\ncase to the Eastern District of Virginia under §1404(a).\nJ-Crew opposed these motions.\n    The District Court denied both motions. It first con-\ncluded that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for en-\nforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another\nfederal forum. The District Court then held that Atlantic\nMarine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer\nwould be appropriate under §1404(a) and that the court\nwould “consider a nonexhaustive and nonexclusive list of\npublic and private interest factors,” of which the “forum-\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

Giving\nparticular weight to its findings that “compulsory process\nwill not be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”\nand that there would be “significant expense for those\nwilling witnesses,” the District Court held that Atlantic\nMarine had failed to carry its burden of showing that\ntransfer “would be in the interest of justice or increase the\nconvenience to the parties and their witnesses.” Id., at\n*7–*8; see also 701 F. 3d, at 743.\n   Atlantic Marine petitioned the Court of Appeals for a\nwrit of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss\nthe case under §1406(a) or to transfer the case to the East-\nern District of Virginia under §1404(a). The Court of\nAppeals denied Atlantic Marine’s petition because Atlantic\nMarine had not established a “ ‘clear and indisputable’ ”\nright to relief. Id., at 738; see Cheney v. United States\nDist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 381 (2004) (mandamus\n“petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that [his]\nright to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable”\n(internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).\nRelying on Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487\nU. S. 22 (1988), the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism\nfor enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to an-\nother federal forum when venue is otherwise proper in the\ndistrict where the case was brought. See 701 F. 3d, at\n739–741.1 The court stated, however, that if a forum-\nselection clause points to a nonfederal forum, dismissal\nunder Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism to\n——————\n  1 Venue was otherwise proper in the Western District of Texas be-\n\ncause the subcontract at issue in the suit was entered into and was to\nbe performed in that district.

The Court of Appeals then concluded\nthat the District Court had not clearly abused its discre-\ntion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the\nbalance-of-interests analysis required by §1404(a). Id., at\n741–743; see Cheney, supra, at 380 (permitting mandamus\nrelief to correct “a clear abuse of discretion” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). That was so even though there\nwas no dispute that the forum-selection clause was valid.\nSee 701 F. 3d, at 742; id., at 744 (concurring opinion). We\ngranted certiorari. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n  Atlantic Marine contends that a party may enforce a\nforum-selection clause by seeking dismissal of the suit\nunder §1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3). We disagree. Section\n1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue\nis “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or\n“improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in\nwhich the case was brought satisfies the requirements of\nfederal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing\nabout a forum-selection clause.\n                              A\n  Section 1406(a) provides that “[t]he district court of a\ndistrict in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong\ndivision or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest\nof justice, transfer such case to any district or division in\nwhich it could have been brought.” Rule 12(b)(3) states\nthat a party may move to dismiss a case for “improper\nvenue.” These provisions therefore authorize dismissal\nonly when venue is “wrong” or “improper” in the forum in\nwhich it was brought.\n  This question—whether venue is “wrong” or “improper”—is\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngenerally governed by 28 U. S. C. §1391 (2006 ed., Supp. V).2\nThat provision states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided\nby law . . . this section shall govern the venue of all civil\nactions brought in district courts of the United States.”\n§1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). It further provides that “[a]\ncivil action may be brought in—(1) a judicial district in\nwhich any defendant resides, if all defendants are resi-\ndents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a\njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events\nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is\nsituated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action\nmay otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any\njudicial district in which any defendant is subject to the\ncourt’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.”\n§1391(b).3 When venue is challenged, the court must\ndetermine whether the case falls within one of the three\ncategories set out in §1391(b). If it does, venue is proper;\nif it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be\ndismissed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the\nparties entered into a contract containing a forum-\nselection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into\none of the categories of cases listed in §1391(b). As a\nresult, a case filed in a district that falls within §1391 may\nnot be dismissed under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n   Petitioner’s contrary view improperly conflates the\nspecial statutory term “venue” and the word “forum.” It\nis certainly true that, in some contexts, the word “venue”\nis used synonymously with the term “forum,” but §1391\nmakes clear that venue in “all civil actions” must be de-\ntermined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that\n——————\n  2 Section 1391 governs “venue generally,” that is, in cases where a\n\nmore specific venue provision does not apply. Cf., e.g., §1400 (identify-\ning proper venue for copyright and patent suits).\n  3 Other provisions of §1391 define the requirements for proper venue\n\nin particular circumstances.\n6   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n            COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsection. That language cannot reasonably be read to allow\njudicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations\non the forum in which a case may be brought.\n   The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms\nthat they alone define whether venue exists in a given\nforum. In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress’\nintent that venue should always lie in some federal court\nwhenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over\nthe defendant. The first two paragraphs of §1391(b) de-\nfine the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical\ncase, but the third paragraph provides a fallback option: If\nno other venue is proper, then venue will lie in “any judi-\ncial district in which any defendant is subject to the\ncourt’s personal jurisdiction” (emphasis added). The stat-\nute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has\npersonal jurisdiction over the defendant, venue will al-\nways lie somewhere. As we have previously noted, “Con-\ngress does not in general intend to create venue gaps,\nwhich take away with one hand what Congress has given\nby way of jurisdictional grant with the other.” Smith v.\nUnited States, 507 U. S. 197, 203 (1993) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Yet petitioner’s approach would\nmean that in some number of cases—those in which the\nforum-selection clause points to a state or foreign court—\nvenue would not lie in any federal district. That would not\ncomport with the statute’s design, which contemplates\nthat venue will always exist in some federal court.\n   The conclusion that venue is proper so long as the re-\nquirements of §1391(b) are met, irrespective of any forum-\nselection clause, also follows from our prior decisions\nconstruing the federal venue statutes. In Van Dusen v.\nBarrack, 376 U. S. 612 (1964), we considered the meaning\nof §1404(a), which authorizes a district court to “transfer\nany civil action to any other district or division where it\nmight have been brought.” The question in Van Dusen\nwas whether §1404(a) allows transfer to a district in which\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvenue is proper under §1391 but in which the case could\nnot have been pursued in light of substantive state-law\nlimitations on the suit. See id., at 614–615. In holding\nthat transfer is permissible in that context, we construed\nthe phrase “where it might have been brought” to refer\nto “the federal laws delimiting the districts in which such\nan action ‘may be brought,’ ” id., at 624, noting that\n “the phrase ‘may be brought’ recurs at least 10 times” in\n§§1391–1406, id., at 622. We perceived “no valid reason\nfor reading the words ‘where it might have been brought’\nto narrow the range of permissible federal forums beyond\nthose permitted by federal venue statutes.” Id., at 623.\n   As we noted in Van Dusen, §1406(a) “shares the same\nstatutory context” as §1404(a) and “contain[s] a similar\nphrase.” Id., at 621, n. 11. It instructs a court to transfer\na case from the “wrong” district to a district “in which it\ncould have been brought.” The most reasonable interpre-\ntation of that provision is that a district cannot be “wrong”\nif it is one in which the case could have been brought\nunder §1391. Under the construction of the venue laws we\nadopted in Van Dusen, a “wrong” district is therefore a\ndistrict other than “those districts in which Congress has\nprovided by its venue statutes that the action ‘may be\nbrought.’ ” Id., at 618 (emphasis added). If the federal\nvenue statutes establish that suit may be brought in a\nparticular district, a contractual bar cannot render venue\nin that district “wrong.”\n   Our holding also finds support in Stewart, 487 U. S. 22.\nAs here, the parties in Stewart had included a forum-\nselection clause in the relevant contract, but the plaintiff\nfiled suit in a different federal district. The defendant had\ninitially moved to transfer the case or, in the alternative,\nto dismiss for improper venue under §1406(a), but by the\ntime the case reached this Court, the defendant had aban-\ndoned its §1406(a) argument and sought only transfer\nunder §1404(a). We rejected the plaintiff ’s argument that\n8   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST. \n\n            COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstate law governs a motion to transfer venue pursuant to a\nforum-selection clause, concluding instead that “federal\nlaw, specifically 28 U. S. C. §1404(a), governs the District\nCourt’s decision whether to give effect to the parties’\nforum-selection clause.” Id., at 32. We went on to explain\nthat a “motion to transfer under §1404(a) . . . calls on the\ndistrict court to weigh in the balance a number of case-\nspecific factors” and that the “presence of a forum-\nselection clause . . . will be a significant factor that figures\ncentrally in the district court’s calculus.” Id., at 29.\n  The question whether venue in the original court was\n“wrong” under §1406(a) was not before the Court, but we\nwrote in a footnote that “[t]he parties do not dispute that\nthe District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss\nthe case for improper venue under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)\nbecause respondent apparently does business in the\nNorthern District of Alabama. See 28 U. S. C. §1391(c)\n(venue proper in judicial district in which corporation is\ndoing business).” Id., at 28, n. 8. In other words, because\n§1391 made venue proper, venue could not be “wrong” for\npurposes of §1406(a). Though dictum, the Court’s obser-\nvation supports the holding we reach today. A contrary\nview would all but drain Stewart of any significance. If a\nforum-selection clause rendered venue in all other federal\ncourts “wrong,” a defendant could always obtain automatic\ndismissal or transfer under §1406(a) and would not have\nany reason to resort to §1404(a). Stewart’s holding would\nbe limited to the presumably rare case in which the de-\nfendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under §1406(a)\nor Rule 12(b)(3).\n                            B\n  Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue\nin a court “wrong” or “improper” within the meaning of\n§1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced\nthrough a motion to transfer under §1404(a).

S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion states that “[f ]or the convenience of parties and wit-\nnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may\ntransfer any civil action to any other district or division\nwhere it might have been brought or to any district or\ndivision to which all parties have consented.” Unlike\n§1406(a), §1404(a) does not condition transfer on the ini-\ntial forum’s being “wrong.” And it permits transfer to\nany district where venue is also proper (i.e., “where [the\ncase] might have been brought”) or to any other district to\nwhich the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.\n   Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for\nenforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a\nparticular federal district. And for the reasons we address\nin Part III, infra, a proper application of §1404(a) requires\nthat a forum-selection clause be “given controlling weight\nin all but the most exceptional cases.” Stewart, supra, at\n33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Atlantic Marine argues that §1404(a) is not a suitable\nmechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because\nthat provision cannot provide for transfer when a forum-\nselection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal, see\nBrief for Petitioner 18–19, and we agree with Atlantic\nMarine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound\nanswer to this problem. The Court of Appeals opined that\na forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum\nshould be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a\nparty to move for dismissal of a case based on “improper\nvenue.” 701 F. 3d, at 740. As Atlantic Marine persua-\nsively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be recon-\nciled with our construction of the term “improper venue” in\n §1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal\nvenue laws. If venue is proper under federal venue rules,\nit does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether\nthe forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfed-\neral forum.\n   Instead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-\n10 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

OF TEX.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nselection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is\nthrough the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Section\n1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of forum\nnon conveniens for the subset of cases in which the trans-\nferee forum is within the federal court system; in such\ncases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of\noutright dismissal with transfer. See Sinochem Int’l Co. v.\nMalaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007)\n(“For the federal court system, Congress has codified the\ndoctrine . . . ”); see also notes following §1404 (Historical\nand Revision Notes) (Section 1404(a) “was drafted in\naccordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens,\npermitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even\nthough the venue is proper”). For the remaining set of\ncases calling for a nonfederal forum, §1404(a) has no\napplication, but the residual doctrine of forum non conven-\niens “has continuing application in federal courts.” Sino-\nchem, 549 U. S., at 430 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted); see also ibid. (noting that federal courts\ninvoke forum non conveniens “in cases where the alterna-\ntive forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where\na state or territorial court serves litigational convenience\nbest” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nAnd because both §1404(a) and the forum non conveniens\ndoctrine from which it derives entail the same balancing-\nof-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forum-\nselection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the\nsame way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause\npointing to a federal forum. See Stewart, 487 U. S., at 37\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (Section 1404(a) “did not change\n‘the relevant factors’ which federal courts used to consider\nunder the doctrine of forum non conveniens” (quoting\nNorwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U. S. 29, 32 (1955))).\n                           C\n  An amicus before the Court argues that a defendant in a\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

See Brief for Stephen E. Sachs as Amicus Curiae.\nPetitioner, however, did not file a motion under Rule\n12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule’s applica-\ntion to this case at any stage of this litigation. We there-\nfore will not consider it. Even if a defendant could use\nRule 12(b)(6) to enforce a forum-selection clause, that\nwould not change our conclusions that §1406(a) and Rule\n12(b)(3) are not proper mechanisms to enforce a forum-\nselection clause and that §1404(a) and the forum non\nconveniens doctrine provide appropriate enforcement\nmechanisms.4\n                             III\n  Although the Court of Appeals correctly identified\n§1404(a) as the appropriate provision to enforce the forum-\nselection clause in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in\nfailing to make the adjustments required in a §1404(a)\nanalysis when the transfer motion is premised on a forum-\nselection clause. When the parties have agreed to a valid\nforum-selection clause, a district court should ordinarily\ntransfer the case to the forum specified in that clause.5\nOnly under extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\nconvenience of the parties should a §1404(a) motion be\ndenied. And no such exceptional factors appear to be\npresent in this case.\n——————\n   4 We observe, moreover, that a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), unlike a\n\nmotion under §1404(a) or the forum non conveniens doctrine, may lead\nto a jury trial on venue if issues of material fact relating to the validity\nof the forum-selection clause arise. Even if Professor Sachs is ultimately\ncorrect, therefore, defendants would have sensible reasons to invoke\n§1404(a) or the forum non conveniens doctrine in addition to Rule\n12(b)(6).\n   5 Our analysis presupposes a contractually valid forum-selection\n\nclause.\n12 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              A\n   In the typical case not involving a forum-selection\nclause, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion (or a\nforum non conveniens motion) must evaluate both the\nconvenience of the parties and various public-interest\nconsiderations.6 Ordinarily, the district court would weigh\nthe relevant factors and decide whether, on balance, a\ntransfer would serve “the convenience of parties and wit-\nnesses” and otherwise promote “the interest of justice.”\n§1404(a).\n   The calculus changes, however, when the parties’ con-\ntract contains a valid forum-selection clause, which “rep-\nresents the parties’ agreement as to the most proper\nforum.” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31. The “enforcement of\nvalid forum-selection clauses, bargained for by the parties,\nprotects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital\ninterests of the justice system.” Id., at 33 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). For that reason, and because the overarching\nconsideration under §1404(a) is whether a transfer would\npromote “the interest of justice,” “a valid forum-selection\nclause [should be] given controlling weight in all but the\nmost exceptional cases.” Id., at 33 (same). The presence\nof a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to\nadjust their usual §1404(a) analysis in three ways.\n——————\n  6 Factors relating to the parties’ private interests include “relative\n\nease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for\nattendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,\nwitnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate\nto the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case\neasy, expeditious and inexpensive.” Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454\nU. S. 235, 241, n. 6 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). Public-\ninterest factors may include “the administrative difficulties flowing\nfrom court congestion; the local interest in having localized controver-\nsies decided at home; [and] the interest in having the trial of a diversity\ncase in a forum that is at home with the law.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Court must also give some weight to the plaintiffs’\nchoice of forum. See Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U. S. 29, 32 (1995).\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the plaintiff ’s choice of forum merits no weight.\nRather, as the party defying the forum-selection clause,\nthe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that transfer\nto the forum for which the parties bargained is unwar-\nranted. Because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select\nwhatever forum they consider most advantageous (con-\nsistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations), we have\ntermed their selection the “plaintiff ’s venue privilege.”\nVan Dusen, 376 U. S., at 635.7 But when a plaintiff agrees\nby contract to bring suit only in a specified forum—\npresumably in exchange for other binding promises by\nthe defendant—the plaintiff has effectively exercised its\n“venue privilege” before a dispute arises. Only that initial\nchoice deserves deference, and the plaintiff must bear the\nburden of showing why the court should not transfer the\ncase to the forum to which the parties agreed.\n   Second, a court evaluating a defendant’s §1404(a) mo-\ntion to transfer based on a forum-selection clause should\nnot consider arguments about the parties’ private inter-\nests. When parties agree to a forum-selection clause, they\nwaive the right to challenge the preselected forum as\ninconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their\nwitnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation. A court\naccordingly must deem the private-interest factors to\nweigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum. As we\nhave explained in a different but “ ‘instructive’ ” context,\nStewart, supra, at 28, “[w]hatever ‘inconvenience’ [the\nparties] would suffer by being forced to litigate in the\ncontractual forum as [they] agreed to do was clearly fore-\nseeable at the time of contracting.” The Bremen v. Zapata\nOff-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, 17–18 (1972); see also Stewart,\n——————\n   7 We note that this “privilege” exists within the confines of statutory\n\nlimitations, and “[i]n most instances, the purpose of statutorily speci-\nfied venue is to protect the defendant against the risk that a plaintiff\nwill select an unfair or inconvenient place of trial.” Leroy v. Great\nWestern United Corp., 443 U. S. 173, 183–184 (1979).\n14 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsupra, at 33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (stating that Bre-\nmen’s “reasoning applies with much force to federal courts\nsitting in diversity”).\n   As a consequence, a district court may consider argu-\nments about public-interest factors only. See n. 6, supra.\nBecause those factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion,\nthe practical result is that forum-selection clauses should\ncontrol except in unusual cases. Although it is “conceiv-\nable in a particular case” that the district court “would\nrefuse to transfer a case notwithstanding the counter-\nweight of a forum-selection clause,” Stewart, supra, at 30–\n31, such cases will not be common.\n   Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause\nflouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different\nforum, a §1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it\nthe original venue’s choice-of-law rules—a factor that in\nsome circumstances may affect public-interest considera-\ntions. See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 241,\nn. 6 (1981) (listing a court’s familiarity with the “law that\nmust govern the action” as a potential factor). A federal\ncourt sitting in diversity ordinarily must follow the choice-\nof-law rules of the State in which it sits. See Klaxon Co. v.\nStentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487, 494–496 (1941).\nHowever, we previously identified an exception to that prin-\nciple for §1404(a) transfers, requiring that the state law\napplicable in the original court also apply in the trans-\nferee court. See Van Dusen, 376 U. S., at 639. We deemed\nthat exception necessary to prevent “defendants, properly\nsubjected to suit in the transferor State,” from “invok[ing]\n§1404(a) to gain the benefits of the laws of another juris-\ndiction . . . .” Id., at 638; see Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494\nU. S. 516, 522 (1990) (extending the Van Dusen rule to\n§1404(a) motions by plaintiffs).\n   The policies motivating our exception to the Klaxon rule\nfor §1404(a) transfers, however, do not support an exten-\nsion to cases where a defendant’s motion is premised on\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenforcement of a valid forum-selection clause. See Ferens,\nsupra, at 523. To the contrary, those considerations lead\nus to reject the rule that the law of the court in which the\nplaintiff inappropriately filed suit should follow the case to\nthe forum contractually selected by the parties. In Van\nDusen, we were concerned that, through a §1404(a) trans-\nfer, a defendant could “defeat the state-law advantages\nthat might accrue from the exercise of [the plaintiff ’s]\nvenue privilege.” 376 U. S., at 635. But as discussed\nabove, a plaintiff who files suit in violation of a forum-\nselection clause enjoys no such “privilege” with respect to\nits choice of forum, and therefore it is entitled to no con-\ncomitant “state-law advantages.” Not only would it be\ninequitable to allow the plaintiff to fasten its choice of\nsubstantive law to the venue transfer, but it would also\nencourage gamesmanship. Because “§1404(a) should not\ncreate or multiply opportunities for forum shopping,”\nFerens, supra, at 523, we will not apply the Van Dusen\nrule when a transfer stems from enforcement of a forum-\nselection clause: The court in the contractually selected\nvenue should not apply the law of the transferor venue to\nwhich the parties waived their right.8\n——————\n  8 For the reasons detailed above, see Part II–B, supra, the same\n\nstandards should apply to motions to dismiss for forum non conveniens\nin cases involving valid forum-selection clauses pointing to state or for-\neign forums. We have noted in contexts unrelated to forum-selection\nclauses that a defendant “invoking forum non conveniens ordinarily\nbears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff’s chosen forum.” Sino-\nchem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Co., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007).\nThat is because of the “hars[h] result” of that doctrine: Unlike a\n§1404(a) motion, a successful motion under forum non conveniens\nrequires dismissal of the case. Norwood, 349 U. S., at 32. That incon-\nveniences plaintiffs in several respects and even “makes it possible for\n[plaintiffs] to lose out completely, through the running of the statute of\nlimitations in the forum finally deemed appropriate.” Id., at 31 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Such caution is not warranted, however,\nwhen the plaintiff has violated a contractual obligation by filing suit\nin a forum other than the one specified in a valid forum-selection\n16 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  When parties have contracted in advance to litigate\ndisputes in a particular forum, courts should not unneces-\nsarily disrupt the parties’ settled expectations. A forum-\nselection clause, after all, may have figured centrally in\nthe parties’ negotiations and may have affected how they\nset monetary and other contractual terms; it may, in fact,\nhave been a critical factor in their agreement to do busi-\nness together in the first place. In all but the most un-\nusual cases, therefore, “the interest of justice” is served by\nholding parties to their bargain.\n                             B\n   The District Court’s application of §1404(a) in this case\ndid not comport with these principles. The District Court\nimproperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove\nthat transfer to the parties’ contractually preselected\nforum was appropriate. As the party acting in violation of\nthe forum-selection clause, J-Crew must bear the burden\nof showing that public-interest factors overwhelmingly\ndisfavor a transfer.\n   The District Court also erred in giving weight to argu-\nments about the parties’ private interests, given that all\nprivate interests, as expressed in the forum-selection\nclause, weigh in favor of the transfer. The District Court\nstated that the private-interest factors “militat[e] against\na transfer to Virginia” because “compulsory process will\nnot be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”\nand there will be “significant expense for those willing\nwitnesses.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">8499879</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6–*7; see 701 F. 3d, at\n743 (noting District Court’s “concer[n] with J-Crew’s abil-\nity to secure witnesses for trial”). But when J-Crew en-\ntered into a contract to litigate all disputes in Virginia,\nit knew that a distant forum might hinder its ability to\ncall certain witnesses and might impose other burdens on\n—————— \n\nclause. In such a case, dismissal would work no injustice on the plaintiff.\n\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

It nevertheless promised to resolve\nits disputes in Virginia, and the District Court should\nnot have given any weight to J-Crew’s current claims of\ninconvenience.\n   The District Court also held that the public-interest\nfactors weighed in favor of keeping the case in Texas\nbecause Texas contract law is more familiar to federal\njudges in Texas than to their federal colleagues in Vir-\nginia. That ruling, however, rested in part on the District\nCourt’s belief that the federal court sitting in Virginia\nwould have been required to apply Texas’ choice-of-law\nrules, which in this case pointed to Texas contract law.\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">8499879</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8 (citing Van Dusen, supra, at\n639). But for the reasons we have explained, the trans-\nferee court would apply Virginia choice-of-law rules. It is\ntrue that even these Virginia rules may point to the con-\ntract law of Texas, as the State in which the contract was\nformed. But at minimum, the fact that the Virginia court\nwill not be required to apply Texas choice-of-law rules\nreduces whatever weight the District Court might have\ngiven to the public-interest factor that looks to the famili-\narity of the transferee court with the applicable law. And,\nin any event, federal judges routinely apply the law of a\nState other than the State in which they sit. We are not\naware of any exceptionally arcane features of Texas con-\ntract law that are likely to defy comprehension by a fed-\neral judge sitting in Virginia.\n                         *    *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit.

Argued October 9, 2013—Decided December 3, 2013\nPetitioner Atlantic Marine Construction Co., a Virginia corporation,\n  entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management,\n  Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on a construction project. The\n  subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all\n  disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia. When a\n  dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of\n  Texas. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-\n  selection clause rendered venue “wrong” under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)\n  and “improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). In\n  the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the\n  Eastern District of Virginia under 28 U. S. C. §1404(a). The District\n  Court denied both motions. It concluded that §1404(a) is the exclu-\n  sive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to\n  another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of estab-\n  lishing that a transfer would be appropriate under §1404(a); and that\n  the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors,\n  only one of which was the forum-selection clause. After weighing those\n  factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.\n     The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marine’s petition for a writ of\n  mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under\n  §1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under\n  §1404(a). The court agreed with the District Court that §1404(a) is\n  the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that\n  points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3)\n  would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection\n  clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court\n2    ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n             COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after\n    conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by §1404(a).\nHeld:\n    1. A forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer\n under §1404(a), which provides that “[f]or the convenience of parties\n and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer\n any civil action to any other district or division where it might have\n been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have\n consented.” Pp. 4–11.\n       (a) Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when\n venue is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or “im-\n proper” depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case\n was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws. Title\n 28 U. S. C. §1391, which governs venue generally, states that\n “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law . . . this section shall govern\n the venue of all civil actions brought in” federal district courts.\n §1391(a)(1). It then defines districts in which venue is proper. See\n §1391(b). If a case falls within one of §1391(b)’s districts, venue is\n proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dis-\n missed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the parties’ contract\n contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case\n falls into one of the specified districts.\n    This conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue\n provisions, which reflects Congress’ intent that venue should always\n lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal ju-\n risdiction over the defendant. See §1391(b)(3). The conclusion also\n follows from this Court’s decisions construing the federal venue\n statutes. See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612; Stewart\n Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U. S. 22. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a\n court “wrong” or “improper” under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the\n clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under §1404(a),\n which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or\n to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipu-\n lation. Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the\n federal court system. When a forum-selection clause points to a state\n or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of\n forum non conveniens. Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doc-\n trine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another\n federal court. Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp.,\n 549 U. S. 422. For all other cases, parties may still invoke the resid-\n ual forum non conveniens doctrine. See id., at 430.

Petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss un-\n  der Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule’s application.\n  Pp. 10–11.\n     2. When a defendant files a §1404(a) motion, a district court should\n  transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\n  convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. No such excep-\n  tional factors appear to be present in this case. Pp. 11–17.\n        (a) Normally, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion must\n  evaluate both the private interests of the parties and public-interest\n  considerations. But when the parties’ contract contains a valid\n  forum-selection clause, that clause “represents [their] agreement as to\n  the most proper forum,” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31, and should be “given\n  controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases,” id., at 33\n  (KENNEDY, J., concurring). The presence of a valid forum-selection\n  clause requires district courts to adjust their usual §1404(a) analysis\n  in three ways. First, the plaintiff’s choice of forum merits no weight,\n  and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has\n  the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the\n  parties bargained is unwarranted. Second, the court should not con-\n  sider the parties’ private interests aside from those embodied in the\n  forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests. Because\n  public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practi-\n  cal result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in un-\n  usual cases. Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause\n  flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a\n  §1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue’s\n  choice-of-law rules. See Van Dusen, supra, at 639. Pp. 12–16.\n        (b) Here, the District Court’s application of §1404(a) did not com-\n  port with these principles. The court improperly placed the burden\n  on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties’ contractually\n  preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the\n  party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that\n  public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer. It also\n  erred in giving weight to the parties’ private interests outside those\n  expressed in the forum-selection clause. And its holding that public\n  interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract\n  law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Vir-\n  ginia rested in part on the District Court’s mistaken belief that\n  the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas’\n  choice-of-law rules instead of Virginia’s.

We reject petitioner’s\nargument that such a clause may be enforced by a motion\nto dismiss under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Instead, a forum-\nselection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer\nunder §1404(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V), which provides that\n“[f ]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the\ninterest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil\naction to any other district or division where it might have\nbeen brought or to any district or division to which all\nparties have consented.” When a defendant files such a\nmotion, we conclude, a district court should transfer the\ncase unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\nconvenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. In\nthe present case, both the District Court and the Court of\nAppeals misunderstood the standards to be applied in\nadjudicating a §1404(a) motion in a case involving a forum-\n2   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

Atlantic\nMarine then entered into a subcontract with respondent\nJ-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on\nthe project. This subcontract included a forum-selection\nclause, which stated that all disputes between the parties\n“ ‘shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of\nNorfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.’ ” In re\nAtlantic Marine Constr. Co., 701 F. 3d 736, 737–738 (CA5\n2012).\n    When a dispute about payment under the subcontract\narose, however, J-Crew sued Atlantic Marine in the West-\nern District of Texas, invoking that court’s diversity ju-\nrisdiction. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss the suit,\narguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue in\nthe Western District of Texas “wrong” under §1406(a) and\n“improper” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).\nIn the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the\ncase to the Eastern District of Virginia under §1404(a).\nJ-Crew opposed these motions.\n    The District Court denied both motions. It first con-\ncluded that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for en-\nforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another\nfederal forum. The District Court then held that Atlantic\nMarine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer\nwould be appropriate under §1404(a) and that the court\nwould “consider a nonexhaustive and nonexclusive list of\npublic and private interest factors,” of which the “forum-\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

Atlantic Marine Constr.\nCo., 2012 WL 8499879, *5 (WD Tex., Apr. 6, 2012). Giving\nparticular weight to its findings that “compulsory process\nwill not be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”\nand that there would be “significant expense for those\nwilling witnesses,” the District Court held that Atlantic\nMarine had failed to carry its burden of showing that\ntransfer “would be in the interest of justice or increase the\nconvenience to the parties and their witnesses.” Id., at\n*7–*8; see also 701 F. 3d, at 743.\n   Atlantic Marine petitioned the Court of Appeals for a\nwrit of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss\nthe case under §1406(a) or to transfer the case to the East-\nern District of Virginia under §1404(a). The Court of\nAppeals denied Atlantic Marine’s petition because Atlantic\nMarine had not established a “ ‘clear and indisputable’ ”\nright to relief. Id., at 738; see Cheney v. United States\nDist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 381 (2004) (mandamus\n“petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that [his]\nright to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable”\n(internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).\nRelying on Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487\nU. S. 22 (1988), the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that §1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism\nfor enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to an-\nother federal forum when venue is otherwise proper in the\ndistrict where the case was brought. See 701 F. 3d, at\n739–741.1 The court stated, however, that if a forum-\nselection clause points to a nonfederal forum, dismissal\nunder Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism to\n——————\n  1 Venue was otherwise proper in the Western District of Texas be-\n\ncause the subcontract at issue in the suit was entered into and was to\nbe performed in that district.

The Court of Appeals then concluded\nthat the District Court had not clearly abused its discre-\ntion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the\nbalance-of-interests analysis required by §1404(a). Id., at\n741–743; see Cheney, supra, at 380 (permitting mandamus\nrelief to correct “a clear abuse of discretion” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). That was so even though there\nwas no dispute that the forum-selection clause was valid.\nSee 701 F. 3d, at 742; id., at 744 (concurring opinion). We\ngranted certiorari. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n  Atlantic Marine contends that a party may enforce a\nforum-selection clause by seeking dismissal of the suit\nunder §1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3). We disagree. Section\n1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue\nis “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or\n“improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in\nwhich the case was brought satisfies the requirements of\nfederal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing\nabout a forum-selection clause.\n                              A\n  Section 1406(a) provides that “[t]he district court of a\ndistrict in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong\ndivision or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest\nof justice, transfer such case to any district or division in\nwhich it could have been brought.” Rule 12(b)(3) states\nthat a party may move to dismiss a case for “improper\nvenue.” These provisions therefore authorize dismissal\nonly when venue is “wrong” or “improper” in the forum in\nwhich it was brought.\n  This question—whether venue is “wrong” or “improper”—is\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngenerally governed by 28 U. S. C. §1391 (2006 ed., Supp. V).2\nThat provision states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided\nby law . . . this section shall govern the venue of all civil\nactions brought in district courts of the United States.”\n§1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). It further provides that “[a]\ncivil action may be brought in—(1) a judicial district in\nwhich any defendant resides, if all defendants are resi-\ndents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a\njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events\nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is\nsituated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action\nmay otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any\njudicial district in which any defendant is subject to the\ncourt’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.”\n§1391(b).3 When venue is challenged, the court must\ndetermine whether the case falls within one of the three\ncategories set out in §1391(b). If it does, venue is proper;\nif it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be\ndismissed or transferred under §1406(a). Whether the\nparties entered into a contract containing a forum-\nselection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into\none of the categories of cases listed in §1391(b). As a\nresult, a case filed in a district that falls within §1391 may\nnot be dismissed under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n   Petitioner’s contrary view improperly conflates the\nspecial statutory term “venue” and the word “forum.” It\nis certainly true that, in some contexts, the word “venue”\nis used synonymously with the term “forum,” but §1391\nmakes clear that venue in “all civil actions” must be de-\ntermined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that\n——————\n  2 Section 1391 governs “venue generally,” that is, in cases where a\n\nmore specific venue provision does not apply. Cf., e.g., §1400 (identify-\ning proper venue for copyright and patent suits).\n  3 Other provisions of §1391 define the requirements for proper venue\n\nin particular circumstances.\n6   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n            COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsection. That language cannot reasonably be read to allow\njudicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations\non the forum in which a case may be brought.\n   The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms\nthat they alone define whether venue exists in a given\nforum. In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress’\nintent that venue should always lie in some federal court\nwhenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over\nthe defendant. The first two paragraphs of §1391(b) de-\nfine the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical\ncase, but the third paragraph provides a fallback option: If\nno other venue is proper, then venue will lie in “any judi-\ncial district in which any defendant is subject to the\ncourt’s personal jurisdiction” (emphasis added). The stat-\nute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has\npersonal jurisdiction over the defendant, venue will al-\nways lie somewhere. As we have previously noted, “Con-\ngress does not in general intend to create venue gaps,\nwhich take away with one hand what Congress has given\nby way of jurisdictional grant with the other.” Smith v.\nUnited States, 507 U. S. 197, 203 (1993) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Yet petitioner’s approach would\nmean that in some number of cases—those in which the\nforum-selection clause points to a state or foreign court—\nvenue would not lie in any federal district. That would not\ncomport with the statute’s design, which contemplates\nthat venue will always exist in some federal court.\n   The conclusion that venue is proper so long as the re-\nquirements of §1391(b) are met, irrespective of any forum-\nselection clause, also follows from our prior decisions\nconstruing the federal venue statutes. In Van Dusen v.\nBarrack, 376 U. S. 612 (1964), we considered the meaning\nof §1404(a), which authorizes a district court to “transfer\nany civil action to any other district or division where it\nmight have been brought.” The question in Van Dusen\nwas whether §1404(a) allows transfer to a district in which\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvenue is proper under §1391 but in which the case could\nnot have been pursued in light of substantive state-law\nlimitations on the suit. See id., at 614–615. In holding\nthat transfer is permissible in that context, we construed\nthe phrase “where it might have been brought” to refer\nto “the federal laws delimiting the districts in which such\nan action ‘may be brought,’ ” id., at 624, noting that\n “the phrase ‘may be brought’ recurs at least 10 times” in\n§§1391–1406, id., at 622. We perceived “no valid reason\nfor reading the words ‘where it might have been brought’\nto narrow the range of permissible federal forums beyond\nthose permitted by federal venue statutes.” Id., at 623.\n   As we noted in Van Dusen, §1406(a) “shares the same\nstatutory context” as §1404(a) and “contain[s] a similar\nphrase.” Id., at 621, n. 11. It instructs a court to transfer\na case from the “wrong” district to a district “in which it\ncould have been brought.” The most reasonable interpre-\ntation of that provision is that a district cannot be “wrong”\nif it is one in which the case could have been brought\nunder §1391. Under the construction of the venue laws we\nadopted in Van Dusen, a “wrong” district is therefore a\ndistrict other than “those districts in which Congress has\nprovided by its venue statutes that the action ‘may be\nbrought.’ ” Id., at 618 (emphasis added). If the federal\nvenue statutes establish that suit may be brought in a\nparticular district, a contractual bar cannot render venue\nin that district “wrong.”\n   Our holding also finds support in Stewart, 487 U. S. 22.\nAs here, the parties in Stewart had included a forum-\nselection clause in the relevant contract, but the plaintiff\nfiled suit in a different federal district. The defendant had\ninitially moved to transfer the case or, in the alternative,\nto dismiss for improper venue under §1406(a), but by the\ntime the case reached this Court, the defendant had aban-\ndoned its §1406(a) argument and sought only transfer\nunder §1404(a). We rejected the plaintiff ’s argument that\n8   ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST. \n\n            COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstate law governs a motion to transfer venue pursuant to a\nforum-selection clause, concluding instead that “federal\nlaw, specifically 28 U. S. C. §1404(a), governs the District\nCourt’s decision whether to give effect to the parties’\nforum-selection clause.” Id., at 32. We went on to explain\nthat a “motion to transfer under §1404(a) . . . calls on the\ndistrict court to weigh in the balance a number of case-\nspecific factors” and that the “presence of a forum-\nselection clause . . . will be a significant factor that figures\ncentrally in the district court’s calculus.” Id., at 29.\n  The question whether venue in the original court was\n“wrong” under §1406(a) was not before the Court, but we\nwrote in a footnote that “[t]he parties do not dispute that\nthe District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss\nthe case for improper venue under 28 U. S. C. §1406(a)\nbecause respondent apparently does business in the\nNorthern District of Alabama. See 28 U. S. C. §1391(c)\n(venue proper in judicial district in which corporation is\ndoing business).” Id., at 28, n. 8. In other words, because\n§1391 made venue proper, venue could not be “wrong” for\npurposes of §1406(a). Though dictum, the Court’s obser-\nvation supports the holding we reach today. A contrary\nview would all but drain Stewart of any significance. If a\nforum-selection clause rendered venue in all other federal\ncourts “wrong,” a defendant could always obtain automatic\ndismissal or transfer under §1406(a) and would not have\nany reason to resort to §1404(a). Stewart’s holding would\nbe limited to the presumably rare case in which the de-\nfendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under §1406(a)\nor Rule 12(b)(3).\n                            B\n  Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue\nin a court “wrong” or “improper” within the meaning of\n§1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced\nthrough a motion to transfer under §1404(a). That provi-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion states that “[f ]or the convenience of parties and wit-\nnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may\ntransfer any civil action to any other district or division\nwhere it might have been brought or to any district or\ndivision to which all parties have consented.” Unlike\n§1406(a), §1404(a) does not condition transfer on the ini-\ntial forum’s being “wrong.” And it permits transfer to\nany district where venue is also proper (i.e., “where [the\ncase] might have been brought”) or to any other district to\nwhich the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.\n   Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for\nenforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a\nparticular federal district. And for the reasons we address\nin Part III, infra, a proper application of §1404(a) requires\nthat a forum-selection clause be “given controlling weight\nin all but the most exceptional cases.” Stewart, supra, at\n33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Atlantic Marine argues that §1404(a) is not a suitable\nmechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because\nthat provision cannot provide for transfer when a forum-\nselection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal, see\nBrief for Petitioner 18–19, and we agree with Atlantic\nMarine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound\nanswer to this problem. The Court of Appeals opined that\na forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum\nshould be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a\nparty to move for dismissal of a case based on “improper\nvenue.” 701 F. 3d, at 740. As Atlantic Marine persua-\nsively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be recon-\nciled with our construction of the term “improper venue” in\n §1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal\nvenue laws. If venue is proper under federal venue rules,\nit does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether\nthe forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfed-\neral forum.\n   Instead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-\n10 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR.

OF TEX.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nselection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is\nthrough the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Section\n1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of forum\nnon conveniens for the subset of cases in which the trans-\nferee forum is within the federal court system; in such\ncases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of\noutright dismissal with transfer. See Sinochem Int’l Co. v.\nMalaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007)\n(“For the federal court system, Congress has codified the\ndoctrine . . . ”); see also notes following §1404 (Historical\nand Revision Notes) (Section 1404(a) “was drafted in\naccordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens,\npermitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even\nthough the venue is proper”). For the remaining set of\ncases calling for a nonfederal forum, §1404(a) has no\napplication, but the residual doctrine of forum non conven-\niens “has continuing application in federal courts.” Sino-\nchem, 549 U. S., at 430 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted); see also ibid. (noting that federal courts\ninvoke forum non conveniens “in cases where the alterna-\ntive forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where\na state or territorial court serves litigational convenience\nbest” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nAnd because both §1404(a) and the forum non conveniens\ndoctrine from which it derives entail the same balancing-\nof-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forum-\nselection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the\nsame way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause\npointing to a federal forum. See Stewart, 487 U. S., at 37\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (Section 1404(a) “did not change\n‘the relevant factors’ which federal courts used to consider\nunder the doctrine of forum non conveniens” (quoting\nNorwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U. S. 29, 32 (1955))).\n                           C\n  An amicus before the Court argues that a defendant in a\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbreach-of-contract action should be able to obtain dismis-\nsal under Rule 12(b)(6) if the plaintiff files suit in a dis-\ntrict other than the one specified in a valid forum-selection\nclause. See Brief for Stephen E. Sachs as Amicus Curiae.\nPetitioner, however, did not file a motion under Rule\n12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule’s applica-\ntion to this case at any stage of this litigation. We there-\nfore will not consider it. Even if a defendant could use\nRule 12(b)(6) to enforce a forum-selection clause, that\nwould not change our conclusions that §1406(a) and Rule\n12(b)(3) are not proper mechanisms to enforce a forum-\nselection clause and that §1404(a) and the forum non\nconveniens doctrine provide appropriate enforcement\nmechanisms.4\n                             III\n  Although the Court of Appeals correctly identified\n§1404(a) as the appropriate provision to enforce the forum-\nselection clause in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in\nfailing to make the adjustments required in a §1404(a)\nanalysis when the transfer motion is premised on a forum-\nselection clause. When the parties have agreed to a valid\nforum-selection clause, a district court should ordinarily\ntransfer the case to the forum specified in that clause.5\nOnly under extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the\nconvenience of the parties should a §1404(a) motion be\ndenied. And no such exceptional factors appear to be\npresent in this case.\n——————\n   4 We observe, moreover, that a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), unlike a\n\nmotion under §1404(a) or the forum non conveniens doctrine, may lead\nto a jury trial on venue if issues of material fact relating to the validity\nof the forum-selection clause arise. Even if Professor Sachs is ultimately\ncorrect, therefore, defendants would have sensible reasons to invoke\n§1404(a) or the forum non conveniens doctrine in addition to Rule\n12(b)(6).\n   5 Our analysis presupposes a contractually valid forum-selection\n\nclause.\n12 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              A\n   In the typical case not involving a forum-selection\nclause, a district court considering a §1404(a) motion (or a\nforum non conveniens motion) must evaluate both the\nconvenience of the parties and various public-interest\nconsiderations.6 Ordinarily, the district court would weigh\nthe relevant factors and decide whether, on balance, a\ntransfer would serve “the convenience of parties and wit-\nnesses” and otherwise promote “the interest of justice.”\n§1404(a).\n   The calculus changes, however, when the parties’ con-\ntract contains a valid forum-selection clause, which “rep-\nresents the parties’ agreement as to the most proper\nforum.” Stewart, 487 U. S., at 31. The “enforcement of\nvalid forum-selection clauses, bargained for by the parties,\nprotects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital\ninterests of the justice system.” Id., at 33 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). For that reason, and because the overarching\nconsideration under §1404(a) is whether a transfer would\npromote “the interest of justice,” “a valid forum-selection\nclause [should be] given controlling weight in all but the\nmost exceptional cases.” Id., at 33 (same). The presence\nof a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to\nadjust their usual §1404(a) analysis in three ways.\n——————\n  6 Factors relating to the parties’ private interests include “relative\n\nease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for\nattendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,\nwitnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate\nto the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case\neasy, expeditious and inexpensive.” Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454\nU. S. 235, 241, n. 6 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). Public-\ninterest factors may include “the administrative difficulties flowing\nfrom court congestion; the local interest in having localized controver-\nsies decided at home; [and] the interest in having the trial of a diversity\ncase in a forum that is at home with the law.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Court must also give some weight to the plaintiffs’\nchoice of forum. See Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U. S. 29, 32 (1995).\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the plaintiff ’s choice of forum merits no weight.\nRather, as the party defying the forum-selection clause,\nthe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that transfer\nto the forum for which the parties bargained is unwar-\nranted. Because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select\nwhatever forum they consider most advantageous (con-\nsistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations), we have\ntermed their selection the “plaintiff ’s venue privilege.”\nVan Dusen, 376 U. S., at 635.7 But when a plaintiff agrees\nby contract to bring suit only in a specified forum—\npresumably in exchange for other binding promises by\nthe defendant—the plaintiff has effectively exercised its\n“venue privilege” before a dispute arises. Only that initial\nchoice deserves deference, and the plaintiff must bear the\nburden of showing why the court should not transfer the\ncase to the forum to which the parties agreed.\n   Second, a court evaluating a defendant’s §1404(a) mo-\ntion to transfer based on a forum-selection clause should\nnot consider arguments about the parties’ private inter-\nests. When parties agree to a forum-selection clause, they\nwaive the right to challenge the preselected forum as\ninconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their\nwitnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation. A court\naccordingly must deem the private-interest factors to\nweigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum. As we\nhave explained in a different but “ ‘instructive’ ” context,\nStewart, supra, at 28, “[w]hatever ‘inconvenience’ [the\nparties] would suffer by being forced to litigate in the\ncontractual forum as [they] agreed to do was clearly fore-\nseeable at the time of contracting.” The Bremen v. Zapata\nOff-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, 17–18 (1972); see also Stewart,\n——————\n   7 We note that this “privilege” exists within the confines of statutory\n\nlimitations, and “[i]n most instances, the purpose of statutorily speci-\nfied venue is to protect the defendant against the risk that a plaintiff\nwill select an unfair or inconvenient place of trial.” Leroy v. Great\nWestern United Corp., 443 U. S. 173, 183–184 (1979).\n14 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsupra, at 33 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (stating that Bre-\nmen’s “reasoning applies with much force to federal courts\nsitting in diversity”).\n   As a consequence, a district court may consider argu-\nments about public-interest factors only. See n. 6, supra.\nBecause those factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion,\nthe practical result is that forum-selection clauses should\ncontrol except in unusual cases. Although it is “conceiv-\nable in a particular case” that the district court “would\nrefuse to transfer a case notwithstanding the counter-\nweight of a forum-selection clause,” Stewart, supra, at 30–\n31, such cases will not be common.\n   Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause\nflouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different\nforum, a §1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it\nthe original venue’s choice-of-law rules—a factor that in\nsome circumstances may affect public-interest considera-\ntions. See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 241,\nn. 6 (1981) (listing a court’s familiarity with the “law that\nmust govern the action” as a potential factor). A federal\ncourt sitting in diversity ordinarily must follow the choice-\nof-law rules of the State in which it sits. See Klaxon Co. v.\nStentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487, 494–496 (1941).\nHowever, we previously identified an exception to that prin-\nciple for §1404(a) transfers, requiring that the state law\napplicable in the original court also apply in the trans-\nferee court. See Van Dusen, 376 U. S., at 639. We deemed\nthat exception necessary to prevent “defendants, properly\nsubjected to suit in the transferor State,” from “invok[ing]\n§1404(a) to gain the benefits of the laws of another juris-\ndiction . . . .” Id., at 638; see Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494\nU. S. 516, 522 (1990) (extending the Van Dusen rule to\n§1404(a) motions by plaintiffs).\n   The policies motivating our exception to the Klaxon rule\nfor §1404(a) transfers, however, do not support an exten-\nsion to cases where a defendant’s motion is premised on\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenforcement of a valid forum-selection clause. See Ferens,\nsupra, at 523. To the contrary, those considerations lead\nus to reject the rule that the law of the court in which the\nplaintiff inappropriately filed suit should follow the case to\nthe forum contractually selected by the parties. In Van\nDusen, we were concerned that, through a §1404(a) trans-\nfer, a defendant could “defeat the state-law advantages\nthat might accrue from the exercise of [the plaintiff ’s]\nvenue privilege.” 376 U. S., at 635. But as discussed\nabove, a plaintiff who files suit in violation of a forum-\nselection clause enjoys no such “privilege” with respect to\nits choice of forum, and therefore it is entitled to no con-\ncomitant “state-law advantages.” Not only would it be\ninequitable to allow the plaintiff to fasten its choice of\nsubstantive law to the venue transfer, but it would also\nencourage gamesmanship. Because “§1404(a) should not\ncreate or multiply opportunities for forum shopping,”\nFerens, supra, at 523, we will not apply the Van Dusen\nrule when a transfer stems from enforcement of a forum-\nselection clause: The court in the contractually selected\nvenue should not apply the law of the transferor venue to\nwhich the parties waived their right.8\n——————\n  8 For the reasons detailed above, see Part II–B, supra, the same\n\nstandards should apply to motions to dismiss for forum non conveniens\nin cases involving valid forum-selection clauses pointing to state or for-\neign forums. We have noted in contexts unrelated to forum-selection\nclauses that a defendant “invoking forum non conveniens ordinarily\nbears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff’s chosen forum.” Sino-\nchem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Co., 549 U. S. 422, 430 (2007).\nThat is because of the “hars[h] result” of that doctrine: Unlike a\n§1404(a) motion, a successful motion under forum non conveniens\nrequires dismissal of the case. Norwood, 349 U. S., at 32. That incon-\nveniences plaintiffs in several respects and even “makes it possible for\n[plaintiffs] to lose out completely, through the running of the statute of\nlimitations in the forum finally deemed appropriate.” Id., at 31 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Such caution is not warranted, however,\nwhen the plaintiff has violated a contractual obligation by filing suit\nin a forum other than the one specified in a valid forum-selection\n16 ATLANTIC MARINE CONSTR. CO. v. UNITED STATES DIST.\n           COURT FOR WESTERN DIST. OF TEX.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  When parties have contracted in advance to litigate\ndisputes in a particular forum, courts should not unneces-\nsarily disrupt the parties’ settled expectations. A forum-\nselection clause, after all, may have figured centrally in\nthe parties’ negotiations and may have affected how they\nset monetary and other contractual terms; it may, in fact,\nhave been a critical factor in their agreement to do busi-\nness together in the first place. In all but the most un-\nusual cases, therefore, “the interest of justice” is served by\nholding parties to their bargain.\n                             B\n   The District Court’s application of §1404(a) in this case\ndid not comport with these principles. The District Court\nimproperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove\nthat transfer to the parties’ contractually preselected\nforum was appropriate. As the party acting in violation of\nthe forum-selection clause, J-Crew must bear the burden\nof showing that public-interest factors overwhelmingly\ndisfavor a transfer.\n   The District Court also erred in giving weight to argu-\nments about the parties’ private interests, given that all\nprivate interests, as expressed in the forum-selection\nclause, weigh in favor of the transfer. The District Court\nstated that the private-interest factors “militat[e] against\na transfer to Virginia” because “compulsory process will\nnot be available for the majority of J-Crew’s witnesses”\nand there will be “significant expense for those willing\nwitnesses.” 2012 WL 8499879, *6–*7; see 701 F. 3d, at\n743 (noting District Court’s “concer[n] with J-Crew’s abil-\nity to secure witnesses for trial”). But when J-Crew en-\ntered into a contract to litigate all disputes in Virginia,\nit knew that a distant forum might hinder its ability to\ncall certain witnesses and might impose other burdens on\n—————— \n\nclause. In such a case, dismissal would work no injustice on the plaintiff.\n\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                 17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits litigation efforts. It nevertheless promised to resolve\nits disputes in Virginia, and the District Court should\nnot have given any weight to J-Crew’s current claims of\ninconvenience.\n   The District Court also held that the public-interest\nfactors weighed in favor of keeping the case in Texas\nbecause Texas contract law is more familiar to federal\njudges in Texas than to their federal colleagues in Vir-\nginia. That ruling, however, rested in part on the District\nCourt’s belief that the federal court sitting in Virginia\nwould have been required to apply Texas’ choice-of-law\nrules, which in this case pointed to Texas contract law.\nSee 2012 WL 8499879, *8 (citing Van Dusen, supra, at\n639). But for the reasons we have explained, the trans-\nferee court would apply Virginia choice-of-law rules. It is\ntrue that even these Virginia rules may point to the con-\ntract law of Texas, as the State in which the contract was\nformed. But at minimum, the fact that the Virginia court\nwill not be required to apply Texas choice-of-law rules\nreduces whatever weight the District Court might have\ngiven to the public-interest factor that looks to the famili-\narity of the transferee court with the applicable law. And,\nin any event, federal judges routinely apply the law of a\nState other than the State in which they sit. We are not\naware of any exceptionally arcane features of Texas con-\ntract law that are likely to defy comprehension by a fed-\neral judge sitting in Virginia.\n                         *    *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. Although no public-interest factors that\nmight support the denial of Atlantic Marine’s motion to\ntransfer are apparent on the record before us, we remand\nthe case for the courts below to decide that question.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2644673/", "sha1": "aba5f8bba4a84800fbda91f7885dc7b0d72cffd8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-006", "time_retrieved": "2013-12-03T09:42:12.343753"}
