But if the statute, as sustained by the state court, undertakes to invalidate the claim of the United States, so that it cannot be enforced at all, because not filed within eight months, we think the statute in that sense transgressed the limits of state power.

Mr. Justice Story thought it clear that the defense of these statutes of limitations could not avail. The question whether a further defense of plene administravit was good, that is, whether a distribution of surplus assets after the payment of all known debts among the heirs, either voluntary or under a probate decree, would protect the administrator from suit by the United States, it was thought not necessary to decide.

Even as a holder of such paper, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> as <i>e.g.</i> negotiable bonds, the United States suing the maker is not bound by a state statute of limitations. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., supra</i><i>.</i> When the United States becomes entitled to a claim, acting in its governmental capacity, and asserts its claim in that right, it cannot be deemed to have abdicated its governmental authority so as to become subject to a state statute putting a time limit upon enforcement. <i>Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99404\"><a href=\"/opinion/99404/chesapeake-delaware-canal-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 126, 127.</p>\n<p>The state court, however, has said that the statute in question is not a statute of limitations, but rather a statute of \"non-claim\" for the orderly and expeditious settlement of decedents' estates. Presumably the court refers to the provision of the statute that if a claim is not filed within the specified period it \"shall be void even though the personal representative has recognized such claim or demand by paying a portion thereof or interest thereon or otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>If this were a statute merely determining the limits of the jurisdiction of a probate court and thus providing that the County Judge should have no jurisdiction to receive or pass upon claims not filed within the eight months, while leaving an opportunity to the United States otherwise to enforce its claim, the authority of the State to impose such a limitation upon its probate court might be conceded. But if the statute, as sustained by the state court, undertakes to invalidate the claim of the United States, so that it cannot be enforced at all, because not filed within eight months, we think the statute in that sense transgressed the limits of state power. <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Corona Coal Co., supra</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Mr. Justice Story had occasion to consider the application to the Government of a state statute purporting to bar claims against decedents' estates in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hoar,</i> Fed. Cas. No. 15,373; 2 Mason 311. There an action was brought by the United States against an administrator <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> of an estate and the defendant pleaded the general statute of limitation of Massachusetts as to personal actions and also the particular statute limiting suits against executors and administrators to four years after the acceptance of the trust. Mr. Justice Story thought it clear that the defense of these statutes of limitations could not avail. The question whether a further defense of <i>plene administravit</i> was good, that is, whether a distribution of surplus assets after the payment of all known debts among the heirs, either voluntary or under a probate decree, would protect the administrator from suit by the United States, it was thought not necessary to decide. Nor have we such a question here.</p>\n<p>We hold that the state statute in this instance requiring claims to be filed within eight months cannot deprive the United States of its right to enforce its claim; that the United States still has its right of action against the administrator, even though the probate court is to be regarded as having no jurisdiction to receive a claim after the expiration of the specified period.</p>\n<p>So far as the judgment goes beyond the question of the jurisdiction of the probate court and purports to adjudge that the claim of the United States is void as a claim against the estate of the decedent because of failure to comply with the statute, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p>The cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 103364, "judges": "Hughes", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/103364/", "sha1": "f2224966c780574071c9089ac5c297882ef7fefb", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:54:23"}
