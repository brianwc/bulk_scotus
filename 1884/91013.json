The first count of the declaration states that for the 11 months ending September 30, 1868, the gross receipts of the company from passengers were $51,786.12, on which it became liable to pay a tax of 2 1/2 per cent., or $1,294.55; and that the undivided net earnings of the company for the same period, which were carried to the construction fund or account, were $43,889.39, on which the company became liable to pay a tax of 5 per cent., amounting to $2,194.41; that the company paid the tax on gross receipts, but refused to pay the tax on net earnings carried to construction account. Three other counts for the following years showed an aggregate arrearage (including that stated in the first count) of over $11,000. There were four other counts for penalties, to which the statute of limitations was pleaded, and which are not the subject of controversy. Issue being taken on the first four counts, the parties entered into a stipulation for the purpose of showing the precise matter in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This stipulation, after stating the title of the cause, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The parties to the above-entitled action hereby stipulate to      waive a jury on the trial thereof.

We think that the judgment was right. The accruing interest on the subsidy bonds loaned by the government to the company is payable by the company at a future day, to-wit, at the maturity of the bonds; and if a sufficient amount of the company's annual net earnings is laid aside (as it should be) to meet that interest when it shall become due, the amount so laid aside would be directly within the scope of the internal revenue act, as it stood when the net earnings in question arose. The 122d section of that act, as amended in 1866, imposed a 5 per cent. tax, not only on all payments of interest due on bonds and on all dividends declared by any railroad or canal company, but also on 'all profits of such company carried to the account of any fund, or used for construction.' The profits here referred to are the profits arising from the operation of the road or canal without deduction of interest paid to its bondholders, or dividends paid to its stockholders, and correspond to the phrase 'net earnings' used in the stipulation of the parties in this case. <i>U. Pacific R. Co.</i> v. <i>U. S.</i> 99 U. S. 402. The expression in the act, 'profits carried to the account of any fund,' would cover the exact case here if any portion of such net earnings had been carried to a fund created for meeting the interest to be paid on the subsidy bonds. It is very clear, therefore, that whether the whole of said net earnings were carried to construction account (as admitted in the stipulation) or a part of it were carried to account of such accruing interest fund, it would be expressly taxable by the internal revenue act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same result, we think, would have followed had the interest in the subsidy bonds been payable by the company semi-annually as it fell due; for although the words of the internal revenue act, as that act stood when the transactions in question occurred, (14 St. 138,) imposed the 5 per cent. tax upon interest due and payable by a railroad or canal company only where such company was indebted for 'money for which <i>bonds or other evidence of indebtedness have been issued</i>, payable in one or more years after date, upon which interest is stipulated to be paid, or coupons representing the interest;' which words may be regarded as literally referring only to 'bonds or other evidence of indebtedness' issued by the company itself; yet, if the company had been obliged to pay the interest accruing on the subsidy bonds semi-annually as the same fell due, said bonds would have been, in effect, the bonds 'or other evidence of indebtedness' of the company. Though in form government bonds, the subsidy act makes them a mortgage lien on the property of the company, and ultimately payable by the company, principal and interest, (12 St. at Large, 492, 493;) and if an obligation had been imposed by the statute to pay both principal and interest as they respectively fell due, it would have made them substantially and in effect, the bonds of the company, and fairly taxable under the internal revenue act. Be this, however, as it may, it is clear that where, as in the present case, the interest is to be provided for by a fund, in the nature of a sinking fund, to be laid by for the purpose, the case comes within the express terms of the internal revenue act, and no deduction of such accruing interest can be made from the taxable net earnings of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>110 U.S. 205 (1884)</b></center>\n<center><h1>SIOUX CITY &amp; PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted December 18th, 1883.</center>\n<center>Decided January 21st, 1884.</center>\nIN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF IOWA.\n<p><i>Mr. E.S.

The expression in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> the act, \"Profits carried to the account of any fund,\" would cover the exact case here if any portion of such net earnings had been carried to a fund created for meeting the interest to be paid on the subsidy bonds. It is very clear, therefore, that whether the whole of said net earnings were carried to construction account (as admitted in the stipulation) or a part of it were carried to account of such accruing interest fund, it would be expressly taxable by the Internal Revenue Act.</p>\n<p>The same result, we think, would have followed had the interest in the subsidy bonds been payable by the company semi-annually as it fell due; for although the words of the Internal Revenue Act, as that act stood when the transactions in question occurred, 14 Stat. 138, imposed the five per cent. tax upon interest due and payable by a railroad or canal company only where such company was indebted for \"money for which <i>bonds or other evidence of indebtedness have been issued,</i> payable in one or more years after date, upon which interest is stipulated to be paid, or coupons representing the interest;\" which words may be regarded as literally referring only to \"bonds or other evidence of indebtedness\" issued by the company itself; yet, if the company had been obliged to pay the interest accruing on the subsidy bonds semi-annually as the same fell due, said bonds would have been, in effect, the bonds \"or other evidence of indebtedness\" of the company. Though in form government bonds, the subsidy act makes them a mortgage lien on the property of the company, and ultimately payable by the company, principal and interest, 12 Stat. 492, 493; and if an obligation had been imposed by the statute to pay both principal and interest as they respectively fell due, it would have made them substantially and in effect the bonds of the company, and fairly taxable under the Internal Revenue Act.</p>\n<p>Be this, however, as it may, it is clear that where, as in the present case, the interest is to be provided for by a fund, in the nature of a sinking fund, to be laid by for the purpose, the case comes within the express terms of the Internal Revenue Act; and no deduction of such accruing interest can be made from the taxable net earnings of the company.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 91013, "judges": "Bradley", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/91013/", "sha1": "de70cc5fb2ccb085b8152fafba6d141acf631002", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:49"}
