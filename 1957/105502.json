In addition, it charged petitioners Kremen and Coleman with harboring Steinberg, also a fugitive from justice, and with conspiring to commit that offense. Petitioners were found guilty, and on appeal their convictions were sustained, one judge dissenting. 231 F.2d 155. Because of the unusual character of the search and seizure here involved, we granted certiorari, without, however, limiting the writ. 352 U.S. 819, 77 S.Ct. 46, 1 L.Ed. 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson and Steinberg had been fugitives from justice for about two years when agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered them, in the company of Kremen, Coleman and another, at a secluded cabin near the village of Twain Harte, California. After keeping the cabin under surveillance for some 24 hours, the officers arrested the three petitioners and Thompson. Thompson and Steinberg were arrested outside the cabin; Kremen and Coleman, inside. The agents possessed outstanding arrest warrants for Thompson and Steinberg, but none for Kremen and Coleman. These four individuals were searched and documents found on their persons were seized. In addition, an exhaustive search of the cabin and a seizure of its entire contents were made shortly after the arrests. The agents possessed no search warrant. The property seized from the house was taken to the F.B.I. office at San Francisco for further examination. A copy of the F.B.I.'s inventory of the property thus taken is printed in the appendix to this opinion, 353 U.S. 349, 77 S.Ct. 830.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of the Court are agreed that objections to the validity of the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved. The seizure of the entire contents of the house and its removal some two hundred miles away to the F.B.I. offices for the purpose of examination are beyond the sanction of any of our cases. While the evidence seized from the persons of the petitioners might have been legally admissible, the introduction against each of petitioners of some items seized in the house in the manner aforesaid rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. The convictions must therefore be reversed, with instructions to grant the petitioners a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice CLARK dissent, believing that the items of evidence offered and admitted into evidence were legally seized. They are of the opinion that the validity of a seizure is not to be tested by the quantity of items seized. Validity depends on the circumstances of the seizure as to each of the items that is offered into evidence. Furthermore, only a fragmentary part of the items listed by the Court as seized was admitted into evidence and if any items were illegally seized their effect should be governed by the rule of harmless error since there was ample evidence of guilt otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">FBI INVENTORY OF PROPERTY TAKEN.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Personal Property and Papers</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Sleeping bag with tan air mattress</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Sleeping bag case, Kelly's of Oakland</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Brown canvas cover, Spiro's of San Francisco</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Skysleeper Kit bag</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Tan zipper shaving kit containing:</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Hair brush</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Tooth brush</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Bar soap wrapped, Ivory, hotel size bearing name Hotel      Regis, corner 11th &amp; K Streets, Sacramento, California</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Shoelace</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2 Packages pipe cleaner</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Pencil flashlight battery</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4 Razor blades</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Package lighter flints-Ronson</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1 Spool fishing leader material</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Bar soap, hotel size, wrapped, with \"Pearl\" on one side and      \"Hotel Regis\" on other</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Plaid covered small size bag with zipper for pillow</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 Pillow, cotton filled, small, white.

Maroney</i> argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were <i>Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Harold D. Koffsky, Philip R. Monahan</i> and <i>Carl G. Coben.</i></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Of petitioners' various contentions we find the one relating to the validity of the search and seizure made by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation dispositive of this case, and we therefore need not consider the others.</p>\n<p>The indictment charged the three petitioners with relieving, comforting, and assisting one Thompson, a fugitive from justice, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 3, and with conspiring to commit that offense in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 371. In addition, it charged petitioners Kremen and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> Coleman with harboring Steinberg, also a fugitive from justice, and with conspiring to commit that offense. Petitioners were found guilty, and on appeal their convictions were sustained, one judge dissenting. 231 F. 2d 155. Because of the unusual character of the search and seizure here involved, we granted certiorari, without, however, limiting the writ. 352 U. S. 819.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Steinberg had been fugitives from justice for about two years when agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered them, in the company of Kremen, Coleman and another, at a secluded cabin near the village of Twain Harte, California. After keeping the cabin under surveillance for some 24 hours, the officers arrested the three petitioners and Thompson. Thompson and Steinberg were arrested outside the cabin; Kremen and Coleman, inside. The agents possessed outstanding arrest warrants for Thompson and Steinberg, but none for Kremen and Coleman. These four individuals were searched and documents found on their persons were seized. In addition, an exhaustive search of the cabin and a seizure of its entire contents were made shortly after the arrests. The agents possessed no search warrant. The property seized from the house was taken to the F. B. I. office at San Francisco for further examination. A copy of the F. B. I.'s inventory of the property thus taken is printed in the appendix to this opinion, <i>post,</i> p. 349.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Court are agreed that objections to the validity of the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved. The seizure of the entire contents of the house and its removal some two hundred miles away to the F. B. I. offices for the purpose of examination are beyond the sanction of any of our cases. While the evidence seized from the persons of the petitioners might have been legally admissible, the introduction against each of petitioners of some items seized in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> house in the manner aforesaid rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. The convictions must therefore be reversed, with instructions to grant the petitioners a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent, believing that the items of evidence offered and admitted into evidence were legally seized. They are of the opinion that the validity of a seizure is not to be tested by the quantity of items seized. Validity depends on the circumstances of the seizure as to each of the items that is offered into evidence. Furthermore, only a fragmentary part of the items listed by the Court as seized was admitted into evidence and if any items were illegally seized their effect should be governed by the rule of harmless error since there was ample evidence of guilt otherwise.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FBI INVENTORY OF PROPERTY TAKEN.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Personal Property and Papers</i></h2>\n<p>1 Sleeping bag with tan air mattress</p>\n<p>1 Sleeping bag case, Kelly's of Oakland</p>\n<p>2 Brown canvas cover, Spiro's of San Francisco</p>\n<p>1 Skysleeper Kit bag</p>\n<p>1 Tan zipper shaving kit containing:</p>\n<blockquote>1 Hair brush</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Tooth brush</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Bar soap wrapped, Ivory, hotel size bearing name Hotel Regis, corner 11th &amp; K Streets, Sacramento, California</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Shoelace</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2 Packages pipe cleaner</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Pencil flashlight battery</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4 Razor blades</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Package lighter flintsRonson</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Spool fishing leader material</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Bar soap, hotel size, wrapped, with \"Pearl\" on one side and \"Hotel Regis\" on other</blockquote>\n<p>1 Plaid covered small size bag with zipper for pillow</p>\n<p>1 Pillow, cotton filled, small, white.

Maroney</i> argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were <i>Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Harold D. Koffsky, Philip R. Monahan</i> and <i>Carl G. Coben.</i></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Of petitioners' various contentions we find the one relating to the validity of the search and seizure made by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation dispositive of this case, and we therefore need not consider the others.</p>\n<p>The indictment charged the three petitioners with relieving, comforting, and assisting one Thompson, a fugitive from justice, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 3, and with conspiring to commit that offense in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 371. In addition, it charged petitioners Kremen and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> Coleman with harboring Steinberg, also a fugitive from justice, and with conspiring to commit that offense. Petitioners were found guilty, and on appeal their convictions were sustained, one judge dissenting. 231 F. 2d 155. Because of the unusual character of the search and seizure here involved, we granted certiorari, without, however, limiting the writ. 352 U. S. 819.</p>\n<p>Thompson and Steinberg had been fugitives from justice for about two years when agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered them, in the company of Kremen, Coleman and another, at a secluded cabin near the village of Twain Harte, California. After keeping the cabin under surveillance for some 24 hours, the officers arrested the three petitioners and Thompson. Thompson and Steinberg were arrested outside the cabin; Kremen and Coleman, inside. The agents possessed outstanding arrest warrants for Thompson and Steinberg, but none for Kremen and Coleman. These four individuals were searched and documents found on their persons were seized. In addition, an exhaustive search of the cabin and a seizure of its entire contents were made shortly after the arrests. The agents possessed no search warrant. The property seized from the house was taken to the F. B. I. office at San Francisco for further examination. A copy of the F. B. I.'s inventory of the property thus taken is printed in the appendix to this opinion, <i>post,</i> p. 349.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Court are agreed that objections to the validity of the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved. The seizure of the entire contents of the house and its removal some two hundred miles away to the F. B. I. offices for the purpose of examination are beyond the sanction of any of our cases. While the evidence seized from the persons of the petitioners might have been legally admissible, the introduction against each of petitioners of some items seized in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> house in the manner aforesaid rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. The convictions must therefore be reversed, with instructions to grant the petitioners a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent, believing that the items of evidence offered and admitted into evidence were legally seized. They are of the opinion that the validity of a seizure is not to be tested by the quantity of items seized. Validity depends on the circumstances of the seizure as to each of the items that is offered into evidence. Furthermore, only a fragmentary part of the items listed by the Court as seized was admitted into evidence and if any items were illegally seized their effect should be governed by the rule of harmless error since there was ample evidence of guilt otherwise.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FBI INVENTORY OF PROPERTY TAKEN.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Personal Property and Papers</i></h2>\n<p>1 Sleeping bag with tan air mattress</p>\n<p>1 Sleeping bag case, Kelly's of Oakland</p>\n<p>2 Brown canvas cover, Spiro's of San Francisco</p>\n<p>1 Skysleeper Kit bag</p>\n<p>1 Tan zipper shaving kit containing:</p>\n<blockquote>1 Hair brush</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Tooth brush</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Bar soap wrapped, Ivory, hotel size bearing name Hotel Regis, corner 11th &amp; K Streets, Sacramento, California</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Shoelace</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2 Packages pipe cleaner</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Pencil flashlight battery</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4 Razor blades</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Package lighter flintsRonson</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Spool fishing leader material</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1 Bar soap, hotel size, wrapped, with \"Pearl\" on one side and \"Hotel Regis\" on other</blockquote>\n<p>1 Plaid covered small size bag with zipper for pillow</p>\n<p>1 Pillow, cotton filled, small, white.
