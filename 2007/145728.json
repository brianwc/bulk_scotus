When the deputies searched the house, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of a different race than the suspects. The deputies ordered these innocent residents, who had been sleeping unclothed, out of bed. The deputies required them to stand for a few minutes before allowing them to dress.</p>\n<p>The residents brought suit under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming the deputies and other parties and accusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court granted summary judgment to all named defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding both that the deputies violated the Fourth Amendment and that they were not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would have stopped the search upon discovering that respondents were of a different race than the suspects and because a reasonable deputy would not have ordered respondents from their bed. We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>From September to December 2001, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Deputy Dennis Watters investigated a fraud and identity-theft crime ring. There were four suspects of the investigation. One had registered a 9-millimeter Glock handgun. The four suspects were known to be African-Americans.</p>\n<p>On December 11, Watters obtained a search warrant for two houses in Lancaster, California, where he believed he could find the suspects. The warrant authorized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1991</span> him to search the homes and three of the suspects for documents and computer files. In support of the search warrant an affidavit cited various sources showing the suspects resided at respondents' home. The sources included Department of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing address listings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone directory. In this Court respondents do not dispute the validity of the warrant or the means by which it was obtained.</p>\n<p>What Watters did not know was that one of the houses (the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a Max Rettele. He had purchased the home and moved into it three months earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and Sadler's 17-year-old son Chase Hall. All three, respondents here, are Caucasians.</p>\n<p>On the morning of December 19, Watters briefed six other deputies in preparation for the search of the houses. Watters informed them they would be searching for three African-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered handgun. The possibility a suspect would be armed caused the deputies concern for their own safety. Watters had not obtained special permission for a night search, so he could not execute the warrant until 7 a.m. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1533 (West 2000). Around 7:15 Watters and six other deputies knocked on the door and announced their presence. Chase Hall answered. The deputies entered the house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies' announcement awoke Rettele and Sadler. The deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and ordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands. They protested that they were not wearing clothes. Rettele stood up and attempted to put on a pair of sweatpants, but deputies told him not to move. Sadler also stood up and attempted, without success, to cover herself with a sheet. Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for one to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve a robe for Sadler. He was then permitted to dress. Rettele and Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes to sit on the couch in the living room.</p>\n<p>By that time the deputies realized they had made a mistake. They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them for not becoming upset, and left within five minutes. They proceeded to the other house the warrant authorized them to search, where they found three suspects. Those suspects were arrested and convicted.</p>\n<p>Rettele and Sadler, individually and as guardians ad litem for Hall, filed this § 1983 suit against Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Deputy Watters, and other members of the sheriff's department. Respondents alleged petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining a warrant in reckless fashion and conducting an unreasonable search and detention. The District Court held that the warrant was obtained by proper procedures and the search was reasonable. It concluded in the alternative that any Fourth Amendment rights the deputies violated were not clearly established and that, as a result, the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>On appeal respondents did not challenge the validity of the warrant; they did argue that the deputies had conducted the search in an unreasonable manner. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an unpublished opinion. 186 Fed.Appx. 765 (2006). The majority held that</p>\n<blockquote>\"because (1) no African-Americans lived in [respondents'] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple, purchased the residence several months before the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1992</span> search and the deputies did not conduct an ownership inquiry; (3) the African-American suspects were not accused of a crime that required an emergency search; and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed naked and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched their bedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the search and detention were `unnecessarily painful, degrading, or prolonged,' and involved `an undue invasion of privacy,' <i>Franklin v. Foxworth,</i> 31 F.3d 873, 876 (9th Cir.1994).\" <i>Id.,</i> at 766.</blockquote>\n<p>Turning to whether respondents' Fourth Amendment rights were clearly established, the majority held that a reasonable deputy should have known the search and detention were unlawful.</p>\n<p>Judge Cowen dissented. In his view the deputies had authority to detain respondents for the duration of the search and were justified in ordering respondents from their bed because weapons could have been concealed under the bedcovers. He also concluded that, assuming a constitutional violation, the law was not clearly established.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because respondents were of a different race than the suspects the deputies were seeking, the Court of Appeals held that \"[a]fter taking one look at [respondents], the deputies should have realized that [respondents] were not the subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a threat to the deputies' safety.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We need not pause long in rejecting this unsound proposition. When the deputies ordered respondents from their bed, they had no way of knowing whether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house. The presence of some Caucasians in the residence did not eliminate the possibility that the suspects lived there as well. As the deputies stated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our society for people of different races to live together. Just as people of different races live and work together, so too might they engage in joint criminal activity. The deputies, who were searching a house where they believed a suspect might be armed, possessed authority to secure the premises before deciding whether to continue with the search.</p>\n<p>In <i>Michigan v. Summers,</i> 452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), this Court held that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may \"detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587. In weighing whether the search in <i>Summers</i> was reasonable the Court first found that \"detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 703, 101 S.Ct. 2587. Against that interest, it balanced \"preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found\"; \"minimizing the risk of harm to the officers\"; and facilitating \"the orderly completion of the search.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 702-703, 101 S.Ct. 2587; see <i>Muehler v. Mena,</i> 544 U.S. 93, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005).</p>\n<p>In executing a search warrant officers may take reasonable action to secure the premises and to ensure their own safety and the efficacy of the search. <i>Id.,</i> at 98-100, 125 S.Ct. 1465; see also <i>id.,</i> at 103, 125 S.Ct. 1465 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); <i>Summers, supra,</i> at 704-705, 101 S.Ct. 2587. The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is an objective one. <i>Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (addressing the reasonableness of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1993</span> seizure of the person). Unreasonable actions include the use of excessive force or restraints that cause unnecessary pain or are imposed for a prolonged and unnecessary period of time. <i>Mena, supra,</i> at 100, 125 S.Ct. 1465; <i>Graham, supra,</i> at 396-399, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p>The orders by the police to the occupants, in the context of this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps necessary, to protect the safety of the deputies. Blankets and bedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was known to own a firearm, factors which underscore this point. The Constitution does not require an officer to ignore the possibility that an armed suspect may sleep with a weapon within reach. The reports are replete with accounts of suspects sleeping close to weapons. See <i>United States v. Enslin,</i> 327 F.3d 788, 791 (C.A.9 2003) (\"When [the suspect] put his hands in the air and began to sit up, his movement shifted the covers and the marshals could see a gun in the bed next to him\"); see also <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 336 F.3d 245, 248 (C.A.3 2003) (suspect kept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow while he slept); <i>United States v. Hightower,</i> 96 F.3d 211 (C.A.7 1996) (suspect kept a loaded five-shot handgun under his pillow); <i>State v. Willis,</i> 36,759-KA, p. 3 (La.App.4/9/03), 843 So.2d 592, 595 (officers \"pulled back the bed covers and found a .38 caliber Model 10 Smith and Wesson revolver located near where defendant's left hand had been\"); <i>State v. Kypreos,</i> 115 Wash.App. 207, 61 P.3d 352 (2002) (suspect kept a handgun in the bed).</p>\n<p>The deputies needed a moment to secure the room and ensure that other persons were not close by or did not present a danger. Deputies were not required to turn their backs to allow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing or to cover themselves with the sheets. Rather, \"[t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\" <i>Summers,</i> 452 U.S., at 702-703, 101 S.Ct. 2587.</p>\n<p>This is not to say, of course, that the deputies were free to force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless and standing for any longer than necessary. We have recognized that \"special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention\" might render a search unreasonable. See <i>id.,</i> at 705, n. 21, 101 S.Ct. 2587. There is no accusation that the detention here was prolonged. The deputies left the home less than 15 minutes after arriving. The detention was shorter and less restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour handcuff detention upheld in <i>Mena.</i> See 544 U.S., at 100, 125 S.Ct. 1465. And there is no allegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and Rettele from dressing longer than necessary to protect their safety. Sadler was unclothed for no more than two minutes, and Rettele for only slightly more time than that. Sadler testified that once the police were satisfied that no immediate threat was presented, \"they wanted us to get dressed and they were pressing us really fast to hurry up and get some clothes on.\" Deposition of Judy Lorraine Sadler in No. CV-0206262-RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June 10, 2003), Doc. 26, Exh. 4, p. 55.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue on probable cause, a standard well short of absolute certainty. Valid warrants will issue to search the innocent, and people like Rettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the cost. Officers executing search warrants on occasion enter a house when residents are engaged in private activity; and the resulting frustration, embarrassment, and humiliation may be real, as was true here. When officers execute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to protect themselves <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1994</span> from harm, however, the Fourth Amendment is not violated.</p>\n<p>As respondents' constitutional rights were not violated, \"there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\" <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 3151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>This case presents two separate questions: (1) whether the four circumstances identified in the Court of Appeals' unpublished opinion established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the seizure violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights, see <i>ante,</i> at 1991-1992; (2) whether the officers were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity because the right was not clearly established. The fact that the judges on the Court of Appeals disagreed on both questions convinces me that they should not have announced their decision in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p>In answering the first question, the Ninth Circuit majority relied primarily on <i>Franklin v. Foxworth,</i> 31 F.3d 873 (C.A.9 1994). As Judge Cowen's discussion of <i>Franklin</i> demonstrates, that case surely does not clearly establish the unconstitutionality of the officers' conduct.<sup>[*]</sup> Consequently, regardless of the proper answer to the constitutional question, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. I would reverse on that ground and disavow the unwise practice of deciding constitutional questions in advance of the necessity for doing so. See <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 859, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  See 186 Fed.Appx. 765, 767 (2006) (dissenting opinion) (\"In <i>Franklin v. Foxworth,</i> 31 F.3d 873 (9th Cir.1994), we found unconstitutional the officers' failure to provide clothing to a gravely ill man before exposing his genitals to twenty-three strangers for over two hours, under circumstances where there was no reason why the man was not given clothing. <i>Id.</i> at 876-78. We concluded that the detention was conducted in `a manner that wantonly and callously subjected an obviously ill and incapacitated person to entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable degradation and suffering.' <i>Id.</i> at 878. Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs were not gravely ill, and their brief exposure, which lasted, at most, three or four minutes, was outweighed by the safety risks associated with allowing two occupants to remain in bed under covers during execution of a search warrant\").</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>127 S.Ct. 1989 (2007)</b></center>\n<center><h1>LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, et al.<br>\nv.<br>\nMax RETTELE et al.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 06-605.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Decided May 21, 2007.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1990</span> PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but they were unaware that the suspects being sought had moved out three months earlier.

Decided May 21, 2007 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Depart\nment obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but they\nwere unaware that the suspects being sought had moved\nout three months earlier. When the deputies searched the\nhouse, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of\na different race than the suspects. The deputies ordered\nthese innocent residents, who had been sleeping un\nclothed, out of bed. The deputies required them to stand\nfor a few minutes before allowing them to dress.\n  The residents brought suit under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983, naming the deputies and other parties and\naccusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right to\nbe free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment to all named\ndefendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nreversed, concluding both that the deputies violated the\nFourth Amendment and that they were not entitled to\nqualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would\nhave stopped the search upon discovering that respon\ndents were of a different race than the suspects and be\ncause a reasonable deputy would not have ordered respon\ndents from their bed. We grant the petition for certiorari\nand reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this\nsummary disposition.\n                         I\n  From September to December 2001, Los Angeles County\n2            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. RETTELE\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nSheriff’s Department Deputy Dennis Watters investigated\na fraud and identity-theft crime ring. There were four\nsuspects of the investigation. One had registered a 9\nmillimeter Glock handgun. The four suspects were known\nto be African-Americans.\n   On December 11, Watters obtained a search warrant for\ntwo houses in Lancaster, California, where he believed he\ncould find the suspects. The warrant authorized him to\nsearch the homes and three of the suspects for documents\nand computer files. In support of the search warrant an\naffidavit cited various sources showing the suspects re\nsided at respondents’ home. The sources included De\npartment of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing address list\nings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone\ndirectory. In this Court respondents do not dispute the\nvalidity of the warrant or the means by which it was\nobtained.\n   What Watters did not know was that one of the houses\n(the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a\nMax Rettele. He had purchased the home and moved into\nit three months earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and\nSadler’s 17-year-old son Chase Hall. All three, respon\ndents here, are Caucasians.\n   On the morning of December 19, Watters briefed six\nother deputies in preparation for the search of the houses.\nWatters informed them they would be searching for three\nAfrican-American suspects, one of whom owned a regis\ntered handgun. The possibility a suspect would be armed\ncaused the deputies concern for their own safety. Watters\nhad not obtained special permission for a night search, so\nhe could not execute the warrant until 7 a.m. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §1533 (West 2000). Around 7:15 Watters\nand six other deputies knocked on the door and announced\ntheir presence. Chase Hall answered. The deputies en\ntered the house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the\nground.\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   The deputies’ announcement awoke Rettele and Sadler.\nThe deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and\nordered them to get out of their bed and to show their\nhands. They protested that they were not wearing clothes.\nRettele stood up and attempted to put on a pair of sweat\npants, but deputies told him not to move. Sadler also\nstood up and attempted, without success, to cover herself\nwith a sheet. Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for\none to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve\na robe for Sadler. He was then permitted to dress. Rettele\nand Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes\nto sit on the couch in the living room.\n   By that time the deputies realized they had made a\nmistake. They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked\nthem for not becoming upset, and left within five minutes.\nThey proceeded to the other house the warrant authorized\nthem to search, where they found three suspects. Those\nsuspects were arrested and convicted.\n   Rettele and Sadler, individually and as guardians ad\nlitem for Hall, filed this §1983 suit against Los Angeles\nCounty, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,\nDeputy Watters, and other members of the sheriff’s de\npartment. Respondents alleged petitioners violated their\nFourth Amendment rights by obtaining a warrant in\nreckless fashion and conducting an unreasonable search\nand detention. The District Court held that the warrant\nwas obtained by proper procedures and the search was\nreasonable. It concluded in the alternative that any\nFourth Amendment rights the deputies violated were not\nclearly established and that, as a result, the deputies were\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n   On appeal respondents did not challenge the validity of\nthe warrant; they did argue that the deputies had con\nducted the search in an unreasonable manner. A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re\nversed in an unpublished opinion. 186 Fed. Appx. 765\n4           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. RETTELE\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n(2006). The majority held that\n    “because (1) no African-Americans lived in [respon\n    dents’] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple,\n    purchased the residence several months before the\n    search and the deputies did not conduct an ownership\n    inquiry; (3) the African-American suspects were not\n    accused of a crime that required an emergency search;\n    and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed naked\n    and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched\n    their bedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that\n    a reasonable jury could conclude that the search and\n    detention were ‘unnecessarily painful, degrading, or\n    prolonged,’ and involved ‘an undue invasion of pri\n    vacy,’ Franklin v. Foxworth, 31 F. 3d 873, 876 (9th\n    Cir. 1994).” Id., at 766.\nTurning to whether respondents’ Fourth Amendment\nrights were clearly established, the majority held that a\nreasonable deputy should have known the search and\ndetention were unlawful.\n  Judge Cowen dissented. In his view the deputies had\nauthority to detain respondents for the duration of the\nsearch and were justified in ordering respondents from\ntheir bed because weapons could have been concealed\nunder the bedcovers. He also concluded that, assuming\na constitutional violation, the law was not clearly\nestablished.\n  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing and rehearing en\nbanc.\n                             II\n  Because respondents were of a different race than the\nsuspects the deputies were seeking, the Court of Appeals\nheld that “[a]fter taking one look at [respondents], the\ndeputies should have realized that [respondents] were not\nthe subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a\nthreat to the deputies’ safety.” Ibid. We need not pause\n                 Cite as: 550 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlong in rejecting this unsound proposition. When the\ndeputies ordered respondents from their bed, they had no\nway of knowing whether the African-American suspects\nwere elsewhere in the house. The presence of some Cau\ncasians in the residence did not eliminate the possibility\nthat the suspects lived there as well. As the deputies\nstated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our society\nfor people of different races to live together. Just as peo\nple of different races live and work together, so too might\nthey engage in joint criminal activity. The deputies, who\nwere searching a house where they believed a suspect\nmight be armed, possessed authority to secure the prem\nises before deciding whether to continue with the search.\n  In Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), this\nCourt held that officers executing a search warrant for\ncontraband may “detain the occupants of the premises\nwhile a proper search is conducted.” Id., at 705. In weigh\ning whether the search in Summers was reasonable the\nCourt first found that “detention represents only an in\ncremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of\na home has been authorized by a valid warrant.” Id., at\n703. Against that interest, it balanced “preventing flight\nin the event that incriminating evidence is found”; “mini\nmizing the risk of harm to the officers”; and facilitating\n“the orderly completion of the search.” Id., at 702–703; see\nMuehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93 (2005).\n  In executing a search warrant officers may take reason\nable action to secure the premises and to ensure their own\nsafety and the efficacy of the search. Id., at 98–100; see\nalso id., at 103 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); Summers,\nsupra, at 704–705. The test of reasonableness under the\nFourth Amendment is an objective one. Graham v. Con\nnor, 490 U. S. 386, 397 (1989) (addressing the reasonable\nness of a seizure of the person). Unreasonable actions\ninclude the use of excessive force or restraints that cause\nunnecessary pain or are imposed for a prolonged and\n6            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. RETTELE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nunnecessary period of time. Mena, supra, at 100; Graham,\nsupra, at 396–399.\n   The orders by the police to the occupants, in the context\nof this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps nec\nessary, to protect the safety of the deputies. Blankets and\nbedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was\nknown to own a firearm, factors which underscore this\npoint. The Constitution does not require an officer to\nignore the possibility that an armed suspect may sleep\nwith a weapon within reach. The reports are replete with\naccounts of suspects sleeping close to weapons. See\nUnited States v. Enslin, 327 F. 3d 788, 791 (CA9 2003)\n(“When [the suspect] put his hands in the air and began to\nsit up, his movement shifted the covers and the marshals\ncould see a gun in the bed next to him”); see also United\nStates v. Jones, 336 F. 3d 245, 248 (CA3 2003) (suspect\nkept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow while he slept);\nUnited States v. Hightower, 96 F. 3d 211 (CA7 1996) (sus\npect kept a loaded five-shot handgun under his pillow);\nState v. Willis, 36,759–KA, p. 3 (La. App. 4/9/03), 843\nSo. 2d 592, 595 (officers “pulled back the bed covers and\nfound a .38 caliber Model 10 Smith and Wesson revolver\nlocated near where defendant’s left hand had been”); State\nv. Kypreos, 115 Wash. App. 207, 61 P. 3d 352 (2002) (sus\npect kept a handgun in the bed).\n   The deputies needed a moment to secure the room and\nensure that other persons were not close by or did not\npresent a danger. Deputies were not required to turn\ntheir backs to allow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing\nor to cover themselves with the sheets. Rather, “[t]he risk\nof harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized\nif the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of\nthe situation.” Summers, 452 U. S., at 702–703.\n   This is not to say, of course, that the deputies were free\nto force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless and\nstanding for any longer than necessary. We have recog\n                 Cite as: 550 U.

See id.,\nat 705, n. 21. There is no accusation that the detention\nhere was prolonged. The deputies left the home less than\n15 minutes after arriving. The detention was shorter and\nless restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour handcuff detention\nupheld in Mena. See 544 U. S., at 100. And there is no\nallegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and Rettele\nfrom dressing longer than necessary to protect their\nsafety. Sadler was unclothed for no more than two min\nutes, and Rettele for only slightly more time than that.\nSadler testified that once the police were satisfied that no\nimmediate threat was presented, “they wanted us to get\ndressed and they were pressing us really fast to hurry up\nand get some clothes on.” Deposition of Judy Lorraine\nSadler in No. CV–0206262–RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June\n10, 2003), Doc. 26, Exh. 4, p. 55.\n  The Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue on\nprobable cause, a standard well short of absolute cer\ntainty. Valid warrants will issue to search the innocent,\nand people like Rettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the\ncost. Officers executing search warrants on occasion enter\na house when residents are engaged in private activity;\nand the resulting frustration, embarrassment, and hu\nmiliation may be real, as was true here. When officers\nexecute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to\nprotect themselves from harm, however, the Fourth\nAmendment is not violated.\n  As respondents’ constitutional rights were not violated,\n“there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning\nqualified immunity.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201\n(2001). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consis\ntent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n  JUSTICE SOUTER would deny the petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n                      Cite as: 550 U.
