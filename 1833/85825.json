Under this act, it has been always held, that a decree may be prayed in court, when the decree is pronounced; but if the appeal be prayed, after the court has risen, the party must proceed in the same manner as had been previously directed in writs of error. The judiciary act directs, that a writ of error must be allowed by a judge, and that a citation shall be returned with the record; the adverse party having at least twenty days' notice. This notice, we understand, is twenty days before the return-day of the writ of error. In this case, the appeal is not allowed by the judge, and the citation is to appear before the court then sitting.
