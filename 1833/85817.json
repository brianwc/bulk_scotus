The bill charges that Thaddeus Kosciuszko, being about to leave America, deposited with Mr. Jefferson a paper writing, purporting to be a will, which was executed in Virginia, and is in the following words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'I, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, being just on my departure from America, do hereby declare and direct, that, should I make no other testamentary disposition of my property in the United States, I hereby authorize my friend, Thomas Jefferson, to employ the whole thereof in purchasing negroes from among his own, or any others, and giving them liberty, in my name, in giving them an education in trade or otherwise, and in having them instructed for their new condition, in the duties of morality, which may make them good neighbors, good fathers or mothers, husbands or wives, in their duty as citizens, teaching them to be defenders of their liberty and country, and of the good order of society, and in whatsoever may make them happy and useful; and I make the said Thomas Jefferson executor of this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">T.

Letters of administration have since been granted on it, in the county of Washington, in this district, to Benjamin L. Lear, who is in possession of the fund which is referred to in the paper writing. The plaintiffs contend, that this paper writing is not a will; or if a will, cannot have effect, the bequest contained in it being one which the law will not sustain. They therefore contend, that this will being void and inoperative, they, as the next of kin, are entitled to this fund, there being no creditors to claim.

The law of domicil, with respect to wills, in cases of testacy, or regulating distribution, in cases of intestacy, may be material. It also appears, that the testator made a will in Europe.
