He paid $166.66 for each one; for all $4,166.66. In December, 1922, he acquired from the corporation 1,500 shares for which he paid $100 per share ($150,000) and entered into an obligation to refrain from competing business, etc. Also, he agreed that during 1923 the corporation might repurchase five-sevenths of 1,500 shares at par; during 1924, four-sevenths, etc. Intrinsically (when unincumbered) a share of the company stock was then worth $1,164.70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, during 1922, all these shares (1,525) were exchanged for 6,100 preferred shares, redeemable at $110, and 7,625 common shares, American Viscose Corporation. The basis of exchange was four preferred and five common shares of new stock for one share of old.

His return for that year disclosed as net capital gain the difference between that sum and $154,166.66, total outlay for the 1525 converted shares. Upon this, he paid the assessed tax. Apparently, he supposed apportionment between preferred and common stock of their total cost was impossible or unnecessary; also, that no taxable gain arose before return of his entire outlay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon an audit, the Commissioner ruled that proper apportionment of the total cost, $154,166.66, could be made. He assigned 37 per cent. to the preferred and 62 per cent. to the common shares and made a dificiency assessment of $12,005.38. Thereupon, the taxpayer claimed: First, that in 1922 each Viscose Company share was fairly worth $1,164.70, and, with that as the base, no taxable gain arose upon redemption of the preferred stock. Also, that he had overpaid to the extent of $63,750.

Also, that the base cost for estimating capital gain in 1929 was the fair market value in 1922 of the shares then held. And since the corporation had the right to repurchase at par, the market value of five-sevenths did not exceed $100 per share. Further, that the failure to disclose 1922 taxable gain apparently resulted from innocent mistake of law; there was no false representation of fact; nothing gave support to the claim of estoppel.
