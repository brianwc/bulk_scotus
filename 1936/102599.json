The court found as facts that the defendant had received several such payments within the four months preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy; and that at the time of each payment it had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent, and also that such payment would effect a preference over other creditors of the same class. It refused to rule that the burden rested on the plaintiff to prove further that each payment had the effect of enabling the defendant to receive a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of the same class could have received at the time of such payment if the assets had then been liquidated. Judgment for $1,843 was entered pursuant to the rescript of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (195 N.E. 122), which, in approving the action of the trial court, followed Rubenstein v. Lottow, 223 Mass. 227, 111 N.E. 973. We granted certiorari, 296 U.S. 556, 56 S.Ct. 98, 80 L.Ed. 392, because the decision, while in accord with Bronx Brass Foundry, Inc., v. Irving Trust Co., 76 F.(2d) 935, in the Second Circuit, and Commerce-Guardian Trust &amp; Savings Bank v. Devlin, 6 F.(2d) 518, in the Sixth Circuit, conflicts with W. S. Peck &amp; Co. v.

The payment on account of say 10 per cent. within the four months will necessarily result in such creditor receiving a greater percentage than other creditors, if the distribution in bankruptcy is less than 100 per cent. For where the creditor's claim is $10,000, the payment on account $1000, and the distribution in bankruptcy 50 per cent., the creditor to whom the payment on account is made receives $5,500, while another creditor to whom the same amount was owing and no payment on account was made will receive only $5,000.
