The claim of the petitioner was founded on an application to the governor of East Florida, made by Don Jose de la Moza Arredondo, for a grant of twenty thousand acres of land, in consideration of his services to the Spanish government; which was granted on the 20th of March 1817, at the place solicited, with a promise of a title in absolute property; and surveyed in one tract on the 14th of September 1819.
