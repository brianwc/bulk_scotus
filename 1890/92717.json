By petition to us we are advised that Savage was indicted by the grand jury of Arapahoe county for the crime of murder in the first degree, charged to have been committed on the 25th day of June, A. D. 1889, by killing one Emanuel Harbert; and that on the 23d of October thereafter he was found guilty by the jury of murder in the first degree. A similar judgment to that in the Case of Medley was passed upon him, and he was remanded to the custody of the warden of the penitentiary of the state of Colorado under an order of precisely the same character as that in the Case of Medley. It will thus be seen that the same statute involved in that case was the authority under which the court of Colorado rendered its judgment and committed the prisoner to the care of the warden of the penitentiary; that this statute came into force after the commission of the offense of which Savage was convicted, and is therefore <i>ex post facto</i> in its application to his case. The same order, therefore, that we have directed to be entered in Medley's Case will be entered in this case, releasing the prisoner from the custody of the warden, after due notice to the attorney general of the state of Colorado.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On consideration of the application for the discharge of the petitioner, James H.

Savage before this court, and to certify the cause of his detention and imprisonment, having been duly issued and served, and the said J. A.

Savage under said writ issued out of the district court of Arapahoe county, state of Colorado, is without authority of law, and in violation of the constitution of the United States, and that the said James H.
