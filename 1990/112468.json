Concededly, the issue has only been raised as it relates to      the <i>guilt</i> phase, and I disagree with the majority's      conclusions in this regard.  However, I am deeply troubled by      the effect of this evidence on the sentence, find it contrary      to Florida and federal law, and cannot see the sense in      waiting for a formal petition for writ of habeas corpus to      argue a point I believe should have been argued on direct      appeal.

To permit aggravating factors to be supported by      <i>Williams</i> rule evidence not only expands the rule beyond its      original purpose, but completely relieves the state of its      burden of proving the existence of aggravating factors.      Under this novel approach, aggravating factors could be      proved merely by showing that they existed in collateral      crimes committed by the accused, whether or not they actually      existed in the crime charged in the indictment.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"I do not believe this was a conscious holding of this      Court on the direct appeal, since it was never argued or      addressed.

Under section 921.141(5), only one aggravating factor exists      that in any way concerns collateral criminal activity, and it      expressly is limited to prior convictions of felonies      involving violence.  <i>See</i> &#167; 921.141(5)(b).  To hold that a      judge can consider <i>unconvicted</i> criminal conduct in reaching a      sentence is to permit the weighing of nonstatutory      aggravating factors, contrary to our law.  <i>See Elledge v.

Mississippi,</i> 486 U.S. 578, 108 S.Ct. 1981, 100 L.Ed.2d 575 (1988).  In that case a death sentence had been imposed on the basis of three aggravating circumstances, one of which was a prior New York conviction of a violent felony.  In state collateral proceedings, Johnson had challenged his death sentence on the ground that the New York Court of Appeals had subsequently held that the prior conviction was invalid.  The Mississippi Supreme Court, over the dissent of three justices, rejected that contention holding, in effect, that the subsequent invalidation of the felony conviction had not made the evidence retroactively inadmissible.  See <i>Johnson v. State,</i> 511 So.2d 1333 (1987).  We reversed, concluding that the death sentence could not stand when \"the jury was allowed to consider evidence that has been revealed to be materially inaccurate.\"  486 U.S., at 590, 108 S.Ct., at 1989.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in <i>Johnson</i> did not directly resolve the issue presented in Burr's pending petition for certiorari;  in <i>Johnson</i> the only evidence of the collateral crime that had been received was a certified copy of the invalid conviction, whereas in Burr's trial a witness had testified about the conduct that was later made the basis of an unsuccessful criminal prosecution.  This Court nevertheless concluded that there was enough similarity between the cases to justify a remand of the <i>Burr</i> case to the Florida Supreme Court to reconsider its judgment in the light of our opinion in <i>Johnson.</i>  See <i>Burr v. Florida,</i> 487 U.S. 1201, 108 S.Ct. 2840, 101 L.Ed.2d 878 (1988).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court itself demonstrates by its action today, an order remanding a case to a lower court does \"not amount to a final determination on the merits,\" <i>Henry v. City of Rock Hill,</i> 376 U.S. 776, 777, 84 S.Ct. 1042, 1043, 12 L.Ed.2d 79 (1964), but only a conclusion that an intervening decision is sufficiently analogous to make re-examination of the case appropriate.  That action was proper after <i>Johnson</i> for three important and independent reasons.  First, of course, is the paramount importance of reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in any capital case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In <i>Johnson,</i> as in this case, that concern was implicated by a post-trial development that cast doubt on the reliability of evidence that played a critical part in the sentencing decision.  <i>Johnson</i> made clear, what was apparent before, see <i>Zant v. Stephens,</i> 462 U.S. 862, 887-888, n. 23, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2748-2749, n. 23, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983);  <i>Gardner v. Florida,</i> 430 U.S. 349, 358-359, 362, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204-1205, 1206, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (plurality opinion), that a death sentence cannot stand when it is based on evidence that is materially inaccurate.  Second, because the case had not yet reached the stage of federal collateral review, it was obvious that its ultimate disposition would be expedited by giving the Florida Supreme Court the first opportunity to consider the impact of <i>Johnson;</i>  a different disposition would almost certainly have generated additional collateral proceedings in both state and federal courts.  Third, the arguments in Justice Barkett's dissenting opinion, which were based partly on Florida law and partly on federal law, were buttressed by our reasoning in <i>Johnson</i> and had not been expressly rejected by the State Supreme Court's opinion which focused on respondent's contention that the collateral crimes evidence was inadmissible at the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following our remand in light of <i>Johnson,</i> the Florida Supreme Court denied Burr's request for a new trial, but vacated his sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the portion of its opinion discussing the validity of the conviction, the court stated that the evidence of the collateral act for which Burr received an acquittal \"is inadmissible under <i>Johnson.</i>\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In another portion of its opinion, that may have rested exclusively on <i>Johnson</i> or may have also been predicated in part on the arguments set forth in Justice Barkett's earlier dissent, the court vacated the death sentence:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Our review of the record reveals that the state      introduced no evidence at the sentencing phase beyond that      established at the guilt phase.  There was no evidence of two of the      three aggravating factors other than the collateral crimes      evidence.  The United States Supreme Court held in <i>Johnson</i>      that the eighth amendment requires a stringent review of      death sentences based in part on improper aggravating      circumstances.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In overriding the jury recommendation of life, the      trial judge found as aggravating circumstances that the      murder was committed to avoid arrest;  that it was committed      during the course of a robbery;  and, that it was committed      in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner without any      pretense of moral or legal justification.  The aggravating      factors of witness elimination to avoid arrest and cold,      calculated, and premeditated were established almost entirely      on the collateral crimes evidence.  We cannot say, beyond a      reasonable doubt, that the consideration of this evidence did      not contribute to the sentence, particularly in light of the      jury's recommendation of life.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">.    .    .    .    .</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Nor can we determine whether the one improperly admitted      instance of collateral conduct was determinative of the      outcome.\"  550 So.2d 444, 446 (1989) (footnotes omitted).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding left the trial judge who had heard all the evidence free to rely on the evidence of two of the three collateral crimes&#8212;even though that evidence had not been offered or received for the purpose of proving aggravating circumstances at the penalty hearing.  Instead of allowing the new sentencing hearing to go forward, however, the Florida attorney general decided to request this Court to correct the state court's arguably improper application of <i>Johnson</i> to this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court today accedes to that request, remanding the case once again to the Florida Supreme Court, this time in the light of our more recent decision in <i>Dowling v. United States,</i> 493 U.S. 342, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990).  Its action is ill advised for several reasons.  First, our opinion in <i>Dowling</i> sheds absolutely no light on the question whether a post-trial acquittal should render collateral crimes evidence inadmissible at a sentencing hearing in a capital case. <i>Dowling</i> merely decided, as a matter of federal law, that a pretrial acquittal did not render relevant collateral crimes evidence inadmissible at the guilt phase of a noncapital case.  As a matter of state law, the Supreme Court of Florida several years ago reached a contrary (and in my opinion, a correct) conclusion on that issue.  But, in any event, <i>Dowling</i> did not decide the admissibility of such evidence at the penalty phase of a capital case.  Respect for this Court's legal acumen is not enhanced by asking a state court to reconsider a claim in the light of a patently irrelevant precedent.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if this Court's real purpose in remanding the case is to suggest that the state court may have extended <i>Johnson</i> beyond its precise holding, the action is nevertheless unwarranted because that extension is both completely consistent with the reasoning in <i>Johnson</i> and with the reasoning in relevant state-court cases.  The state court's statement that evidence of the collateral act was \"inadmissible under <i>Johnson</i> \"&#8212;although not strictly accurate&#8212;was a reasonable application of that precedent, especially in light of the Florida rule that acquitted conduct is generally excepted from the rule allowing collateral crimes evidence to be used to establish identity.  And, with respect to sentence, the state court's reliance on <i>Johnson</i> for the proposition that the death sentence could not stand when it was based on evidence that had been rendered unreliable was entirely correct.  When a state supreme court, in compliance with our mandate, has applied an intervening decision in a permissible fashion, we should respect its decision even if we might detect a slight flaw in its opinion.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Court's action today can only prolong the termination of this litigation.  I have previously noted the costs in litigation occasioned by the jury override system in those few States in which such a system is used.  See <i>Schiro v. Indiana,</i> 493 U.S. 910, 914, 110 S.Ct. 268, 270, 107 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (opinion respecting denial of certiorari).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  That delay is exacerbated by ill-advised decisions like this one.  A prompt new sentencing hearing would have eliminated the basis for substantial attacks on respondent's sentence.  That hearing has already been delayed by the attorney general's petition to this Court and, depending on the action the State Supreme Court may take after this second remand, may require further collateral proceedings in both the state and federal systems.  The interest in avoiding unnecessary delay would surely be served by a prompt resentencing.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I must once again express my concern about the Court's unseemly use of its discretionary docket to provide assistance to the prosecution&#8212;particularly in capital cases.  In this case, a jury that heard all of the evidence recommended against a death sentence, and the trial judge's contrary decision was based in part on testimony about a crime of which Burr was later acquitted.  When one considers the fact that the State has not yet come forward with a response to the points made in Justice Barkett's dissent, it is pellucidly clear that the Florida Supreme Court acted wisely in ordering a new sentencing hearing.  Of course, the state court may after reconsideration adhere to its decision remanding for resentencing, just as it might have adhered, with additional explanation, to its original decision upholding the sentence after we vacated for reconsideration in light of <i>Johnson.</i>  There is no good reason, however, for making the state court go through the exercise.  I remain firmly convinced that \"although this Court now has the power to review decisions defending federal constitutional rights, the claim of these cases on our docket is secondary to the need to scrutinize judgments disparaging those rights.\"  <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 697, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1445, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (dissenting opinion).  Surely the State's attenuated interest in enforcing a trial judge's decision to override a jury's recommendation against the imposition of the death sentence in a marginal case like this does not justify the summary action the Court has taken today.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\r\n        <p> See Pet. for Cert. 34-35, quoting Tr. 319-320.

State,</i> 110 So.2d 654 (Fla.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 847, 80 S.Ct. 102, 4 L.Ed.2d 86 (1959), a case holding that evidence of other crimes is admissible in a criminal trial if relevant to prove anything other than the bad character of the defendant or his propensity to commit the crime charged.  In a later case, <i>State v. Perkins,</i> 349 So.2d 161 (1977), the Florida Supreme Court held that the <i>Williams</i> rule did not apply to evidence of collateral crimes for which a defendant had been acquitted.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\r\n        <p> If the acquittal had <i>preceded</i> the trial in this case, the evidence would have been inadmissible under Florida law.

As to the subsequent acquittal, clearly, at the time the <i>Williams</i> rule evidence was admitted, it was not error to do so.  This much had been settled on direct appeal.  There is no reason to suggest that the subsequent acquittal changes that admissibility subsequent to the trial. This Court will not render evidence retroactively inadmissible.\" <i>Burr v.

In that case a death sentence had been imposed on the basis of three aggravating circumstances, one of which was a prior New York conviction of a violent felony.  In state collateral proceedings, Johnson had challenged his death sentence on the ground that the New York Court of Appeals had subsequently held that the prior conviction was invalid.  The Mississippi Supreme Court, over the dissent of three justices, rejected that contention holding, in effect, that the subsequent invalidation of the felony conviction had not made the evidence retroactively inadmissible.  See <i>Johnson v. State,</i> 511 So.2d 1333 (1987).  We reversed, concluding that the death sentence could not stand when \"the jury was allowed to consider evidence that has been revealed to be materially inaccurate.\"  486 U.S., at 590, 108 S.Ct., at 1989.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in <i>Johnson</i> did not directly resolve the issue presented in Burr's pending petition for certiorari;  in <i>Johnson</i> the only evidence of the collateral crime that had been received was a certified copy of the invalid conviction, whereas in Burr's trial a witness had testified about the conduct that was later made the basis of an unsuccessful criminal prosecution.  This Court nevertheless concluded that there was enough similarity between the cases to justify a remand of the <i>Burr</i> case to the Florida Supreme Court to reconsider its judgment in the light of our opinion in <i>Johnson.</i>  See <i>Burr v.

City of Rock Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106795\"><a href=\"/opinion/106795/henry-v-rock-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span>, 777, 84 S.Ct. 1042, 1043, 12 L.Ed.2d 79 (1964), but only a conclusion that an intervening decision is sufficiently analogous to make re-examination of the case appropriate.  That action was proper after <i>Johnson</i> for three important and independent reasons.  First, of course, is the paramount importance of reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in any capital case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In <i>Johnson,</i> as in this case, that concern was implicated by a post-trial development that cast doubt on the reliability of evidence that played a critical part in the sentencing decision.  <i>Johnson</i> made clear, what was apparent before, see <i>Zant v. Stephens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110984\"><a href=\"/opinion/110984/zant-v-stephens/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span>, 887-888, n. 23, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2748-2749, n. 23, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983);  <i>Gardner v.

Second, because the case had not yet reached the stage of federal collateral review, it was obvious that its ultimate disposition would be expedited by giving the Florida Supreme Court the first opportunity to consider the impact of <i>Johnson;</i>  a different disposition would almost certainly have generated additional collateral proceedings in both state and federal courts.  Third, the arguments in Justice Barkett's dissenting opinion, which were based partly on Florida law and partly on federal law, were buttressed by our reasoning in <i>Johnson</i> and had not been expressly rejected by the State Supreme Court's opinion which focused on respondent's contention that the collateral crimes evidence was inadmissible at the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following our remand in light of <i>Johnson,</i> the Florida Supreme Court denied Burr's request for a new trial, but vacated his sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the portion of its opinion discussing the validity of the conviction, the court stated that the evidence of the collateral act for which Burr received an acquittal \"is inadmissible under <i>Johnson.</i>\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In another portion of its opinion, that may have rested exclusively on <i>Johnson</i> or may have also been predicated in part on the arguments set forth in Justice Barkett's earlier dissent, the court vacated the death sentence:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Our review of the record reveals that the state      introduced no evidence at the sentencing phase beyond that      established at the guilt phase.  There was no evidence of two of the      three aggravating factors other than the collateral crimes      evidence.  The United States Supreme Court held in <i>Johnson</i>      that the eighth amendment requires a stringent review of      death sentences based in part on improper aggravating      circumstances.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In overriding the jury recommendation of life, the      trial judge found as aggravating circumstances that the      murder was committed to avoid arrest;  that it was committed      during the course of a robbery;  and, that it was committed      in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner without any      pretense of moral or legal justification.  The aggravating      factors of witness elimination to avoid arrest and cold,      calculated, and premeditated were established almost entirely      on the collateral crimes evidence.  We cannot say, beyond a      reasonable doubt, that the consideration of this evidence did      not contribute to the sentence, particularly in light of the      jury's recommendation of life.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">.    .    .    .    .</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Nor can we determine whether the one improperly admitted      instance of collateral conduct was determinative of the      outcome.\"  550 So.2d 444, 446 (1989) (footnotes omitted).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding left the trial judge who had heard all the evidence free to rely on the evidence of two of the three collateral crimes&#8212;even though that evidence had not been offered or received for the purpose of proving aggravating circumstances at the penalty hearing.  Instead of allowing the new sentencing hearing to go forward, however, the Florida attorney general decided to request this Court to correct the state court's arguably improper application of <i>Johnson</i> to this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court today accedes to that request, remanding the case once again to the Florida Supreme Court, this time in the light of our more recent decision in <i>Dowling v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990).  Its action is ill advised for several reasons.  First, our opinion in <i>Dowling</i> sheds absolutely no light on the question whether a post-trial acquittal should render collateral crimes evidence inadmissible at a sentencing hearing in a capital case. <i>Dowling</i> merely decided, as a matter of federal law, that a pretrial acquittal did not render relevant collateral crimes evidence inadmissible at the guilt phase of a noncapital case.  As a matter of state law, the Supreme Court of Florida several years ago reached a contrary (and in my opinion, a correct) conclusion on that issue.  But, in any event, <i>Dowling</i> did not decide the admissibility of such evidence at the penalty phase of a capital case.  Respect for this Court's legal acumen is not enhanced by asking a state court to reconsider a claim in the light of a patently irrelevant precedent.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if this Court's real purpose in remanding the case is to suggest that the state court may have extended <i>Johnson</i> beyond its precise holding, the action is nevertheless unwarranted because that extension is both completely consistent with the reasoning in <i>Johnson</i> and with the reasoning in relevant state-court cases.  The state court's statement that evidence of the collateral act was \"inadmissible under <i>Johnson</i> \"&#8212;although not strictly accurate&#8212;was a reasonable application of that precedent, especially in light of the Florida rule that acquitted conduct is generally excepted from the rule allowing collateral crimes evidence to be used to establish identity.  And, with respect to sentence, the state court's reliance on <i>Johnson</i> for the proposition that the death sentence could not stand when it was based on evidence that had been rendered unreliable was entirely correct.  When a state supreme court, in compliance with our mandate, has applied an intervening decision in a permissible fashion, we should respect its decision even if we might detect a slight flaw in its opinion.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Court's action today can only prolong the termination of this litigation.  I have previously noted the costs in litigation occasioned by the jury override system in those few States in which such a system is used.  See <i>Schiro v. Indiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112368\"><a href=\"/opinion/112368/thomas-a-schiro-petitioner-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 914, 110 S.Ct. 268, 270, 107 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (opinion respecting denial of certiorari).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  That delay is exacerbated by ill-advised decisions like this one.  A prompt new sentencing hearing would have eliminated the basis for substantial attacks on respondent's sentence.  That hearing has already been delayed by the attorney general's petition to this Court and, depending on the action the State Supreme Court may take after this second remand, may require further collateral proceedings in both the state and federal systems.  The interest in avoiding unnecessary delay would surely be served by a prompt resentencing.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I must once again express my concern about the Court's unseemly use of its discretionary docket to provide assistance to the prosecution&#8212;particularly in capital cases.  In this case, a jury that heard all of the evidence recommended against a death sentence, and the trial judge's contrary decision was based in part on testimony about a crime of which Burr was later acquitted.  When one considers the fact that the State has not yet come forward with a response to the points made in Justice Barkett's dissent, it is pellucidly clear that the Florida Supreme Court acted wisely in ordering a new sentencing hearing.  Of course, the state court may after reconsideration adhere to its decision remanding for resentencing, just as it might have adhered, with additional explanation, to its original decision upholding the sentence after we vacated for reconsideration in light of <i>Johnson.</i>  There is no good reason, however, for making the state court go through the exercise.  I remain firmly convinced that \"although this Court now has the power to review decisions defending federal constitutional rights, the claim of these cases on our docket is secondary to the need to scrutinize judgments disparaging those rights.\"  <i>Delaware v.
