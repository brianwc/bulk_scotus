In the form in which the Agricultural Adjustment Act was introduced in Congress, neither § 9 (a), which authorized the \"processing tax,\" nor § 16, which authorized the floor stocks tax, contained a proviso granting a deduction from the manufacturers' excise tax.<sup>[6]</sup> But § 16 of the bill did provide that under specified circumstances taxpayers subject to the floor stocks tax would be entitled to a tax adjustment in the nature of a refund.<sup>[7]</sup> When the bill was under consideration in the Senate, § 9 (a) was amended by adding a provisco<sup>[8]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> which authorized an adjustment on account of the \"processing tax\" in the nature of a deduction from the manufacturers' excise tax. Thus the bill as finally enacted provided one type of adjustment for the floor stocks tax in § 16 and a different type of adjustment for the processing tax in § 9 (a). We have been pointed to nothing in the Act as a whole or its legislative history which shows that Congress considered these separate methods of adjusting the two taxes insufficient to prevent the burden of \"double taxation\" on the tire manufacturers so far as Congress wanted to prevent it. We cannot say, therefore, that the expressed intention of Congress is defeated by a literal interpretation of the Act which declines to read the proviso of § 9 (a) into § 16.<sup>[9]</sup> The judgment of the Circuit Court is accordingly</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"Sec. 602. Tax on Tires and Inner Tubes.\n</p>\n<p>\"There is hereby imposed upon the following articles sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, a tax at the following rates:</p>\n<p>\"(1) Tires wholly or in part of rubber, 2 1/4 cents a pound on total weight . . .\" Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169, 261.</p>\n<p>[2]  48 Stat. 31.</p>\n<p>[3]  \"<i>Provided,</i> That upon any article upon which a manufacturers' sales tax is levied under the authority of the Revenue Act of 1932 and which manufacturers' sales tax is computed on the basis of weight, such manufacturers' sales tax shall be computed on the basis of the weight of said finished article less the weight of the processed cotton contained therein on which a processing tax has been paid.\" 48 Stat. 36. Although the coverage of this proviso was not specifically limited to the excise tax on tires, the proviso came into § 9 (a) as a Senate floor amendment introduced \"to avoid an unduly burdensome tax on automobile tires.\" 77 Cong. Rec. 1959. The view was expressed on the floor of the Senate that, except for the proposed amendment, the cotton used in tires would be twice taxed by weight; once by the processing tax on cotton, and again by the excise tax on tires. 77 Cong. Rec. 1960. See Note 1, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  Section 16, entitled \"Floor Stocks,\" read in part as follows: \"Sec. 16. (a) Upon the sale or other disposition of any article processed wholly or in chief value from any commodity with respect to which a processing tax is to be levied, that on the date the tax first takes effect . . . with respect to the commodity, is held for sale or other disposition . . . by any person, there shall be made a tax adjustment as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"(1) Whenever the processing tax first takes effect, there shall be levied . . . a tax to be paid by such person equivalent to the amount of the processing tax which would be payable with respect to the commodity from which processed if the processing had occurred on such date.\" 48 Stat. 40.</p>\n<p>[5]  See Note 3, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Senate Hearings on H.R. 3835, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1, 3, 6.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 16 (a) (2) of the original bill, subsequently enacted without amendment, provided that, \"Whenever the processing tax is wholly terminated, there shall be refunded to such person a sum .. . in an amount equivalent to the processing tax with respect to the commodity from which processed.\" In reporting on § 16 the House Committee on Agriculture stated that, \"A corresponding refund is provided on floor stocks when the processing tax finally terminates.\" H.R. Rep. No. 6, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., 6.</p>\n<p>[8]  The proviso, originally introduced as an amendment to § 9 (a), authorized an adjustment to be computed by deducting from the manufacturers' excise taxes on certain articles, including tires, \"an amount equal to the processing tax paid on the cotton used therein.\" 77 Cong. Rec. 1959. Subsequently the method of computing the permissible deduction was altered. See Conference Report accompanying H.R. 3835, printed as H.R.
