As questions of fact are not open for re-examination on a bill of review for errors in law, the truth of any fact averred in a bill of review inconsistent with the decree is not admitted by a demurrer, because no error can be assigned on such a fact, and it is, therefore, not properly pleaded. This disposes of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth specifications of error presented in this bill of review. They are all errors of fact, and can only be determined by a reference to the evidence. It nowhere appears from 'the bill, answer, and other pleadings, together with the decree,' constituting what Mr. Justice STORY said, in <i>Whiting</i> v. <i>Bank of U.

The omission of the name of McGregor from among those against whom it was stated in the decree the bill was taken as confessed, is unimportant. If, as is stated in the brief of counsel for the appellant, he was served with subpoena, and did not plead, answer, or demur to the bill, the decree was in fact <i>proconfesso</i> as to him, and he is as much bound as if he had been particularly named.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the new matter alleged to have been discovered relates to the proceedings in making the sale, and can have no effect on the original decree.

These affidavits cannot be considered on a bill of review to reverse the decree of confirmation for errors appearing on the face of the record, because as evidence they form no part of the record which can be looked into on such a review.
