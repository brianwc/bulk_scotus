The original patent, No. 14,722, was granted to Eben Norton Horsford, April 22, 1865, for 14 years, for an 'improvement in preparing phosphoric acid as a substitute for other solid acids,' and was reissued to the Rumford Chemical Works, as No. 2,597, May 7, 1867, for an 'improvement in the manufacture of phosphoric acid and phosphates for the use in the preparation of food, and for other purposes.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specification of reissue No. 2,979 sets forth the mode of preparing the acid, which is a dry pulverulent acid, described as having the capacity of being intimately mixed with dry alkaline carbonates, or other sensitive chemical compounds, without decomposing them or entering into combination with them, except upon the addition of moisture or the application of artificial heat. It says:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This requires that the phosphoric acid, or acid phosphates,      be mixed with some neutral agent, as flour or starch, gypsum,      etc., so that action of the acid shall be prevented while      dry, and shall, when moisture or heat is applied, be prompt,      thorough, and equally diffused. * * * It may, among other      uses, be mixed with dry alkaline carbonates, carbonate of      potassa, or carbonate of soda, and remain in this state      without evolution of carbonic acid until moistened or heated,      thus making it a substitute for cream tartar and tartaric      acid in the preparation of yeast powder or baking powder. * *      * It * * * is suited to be employed as the acid ingredient in      the preparation of self-raising farinaceous food. In order to      make an article possessing these qualities, and suited to      this office, it is necessary that a powder should be made      which can be not only evenly comminuted and diluted, but one      which shall have so little affinity for the moisture of the      atmosphere that it may be mixed with flour and bicarbonate of      soda in the practical preparation of self-raising flour.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims of reissue No. 2,979 are four in number, as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(1) I claim, as a new manufacture, the above-described      pulverulent phosphoric acid. (2) I claim the manufacture of      the above-described pulverulent phosphoric acid, so that it      may be applied in the manner and for the purposes above      described. (3) I claim the mixing, in the preparation of      farinaceous food, with flour, of a powder or powders, such as      described, consisting of ingredients of which phosphoric      acid, or acid phosphates, and alkaline carbonates, are the      active agents for the purpose of liberating carbonic acid, as      described, when subjected to moisture or heat, or both. (4)      The use of phosphoric acid or acid phosphates, when employed      with alkaline carbonates, as a substitute for ferment or      leaven in the preparation of farinaceous food.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first of February, 1869, the following instrument in writing was executed and delivered by the Rumford Chemical Works to one Allen F. Morgan:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To all people to whom these presents shall come, the Rumford      Chemical Works, a corporation transacting business in East      Providence, in the state of Rhode Island, sends greeting:      Know ye that the said corporation, in consideration of the      agreement, of even date herewith, entered into between it and      Allen F. Morgan, of Memphis, in the county of Shelby and state of      Tennessee, does hereby sell, assign, and transfer unto the      said Allen F. Morgan the right to use, within the territory      described in said agreement, Horsford's patent cream of      tartar substitute, for the purpose of manufacturing within      said territory self-raising cereal flours, with the right to      use and sell the flours so manufactured; to have and hold and      exercise such rights within the limits aforesaid, for and      during the time, and under and subject to the conditions and      limitations, named and specified in the agreement aforesaid,      of even date herewith, to which reference is hereby made as a      part hereof.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day Morgan executed and delivered to the Rumford Chemical Works the following instrument in writing:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To all men to whom these presents shall come: Know ye that      because the Rumford Chemical Works, a corporation located at      and doing business in the town of East Providence, in the      state of Rhode Island, has licensed and granted unto Allen F.      Morgan, of the city of Memphis, county of Shelby, and state      of Tennessee, the exclusive right to manufacture, sell, and      use, during the time of five years from the date hereof, the      article known as self-raising flour, from cereals, by the use      of Horsford's patent pulverulent phosphoric acid, in the      following described territory, to-wit: Beginning at the point      where the nothern boundary of the state of Tennessee touches      the Mississippi river; thence southerly along the said river      to and including Vicksburgh; thence easterly along the line      of the Mississippi Southern Railroad to Jackson; thence      northerly along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad      to Granada; thence north-easterly to the junction of the      eastern boundary line of Alabama with the southern boundary      line of Tennessee; thence along the eastern boundary line of      Middle Tennessee (so called) to the northern boundary line of      Tennessee, and westerly along said boundary line to the point      of beginning,&#8212;by an instrument in writing bearing even date      herewith, which is made a part of this agreement, and because      of other good and sufficient reasons moving him thereto that      he has agreed, and by these presents does covenant and agree,      to and with the aforesaid Rumford Chemical Works, that he      will immediately commence the manufacture of self-raising      flour in accordance with the written instructions furnished      by the said Rumford Chemical Works, as to proportions and      quality of flour, and that he will use all his business tact      and skill, and all other means necessary, to introduce and      sell the same, and to make the sale thereof as large as in      any way possible in the territory aforesaid during the      continuance of the license aforesaid, and no longer, and to      sell the said self-raising flour nowhere but in the territory      specified, except upon the written consent of the said      Rumford Chemical Works. And I further agree to accept in the      aforesaid license such rights as are covered by the patents      granted to Eben N. Horsford, and by him assigned to the said      Rumford Chemical Works, and to maintain them at my own cost      and expense in suits at law, whenever it shall be in my      judgment necessary so to do, and to avail myself of such      advice, counsel, and assistance as the said Rumford Chemical      Works may elect to give in said suits; and to purchase all of      the acid used in making our said self-raising flour of the      Rumford Chemical Works, or of their agents as directed; and      that in case of my failure to perform the covenants and      agreements hereby entered into, it shall be lawful for the      said Rumford Chemical Works to annul and revoke their said      license to me, and to terminate this agreement. The use of      said phosphoric acid by families for domestic purposes shall      not be construed as a violation of this agreement.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the twelfth of April, 1870, the patent was duly extended for seven years from April 22, 1870. On the twenty-first of May, 1870, the extended term was assigned by Horsford to the Rumford Chemical Works. Morgan died on the nineteenth of April, 1869. In July, 1869, his widow, Kate G. Morgan, was appointed administratrix of his estate. She afterwards intermarried with J. N. Payne. A suit at law was brought in 1875 in the name of the Rumford Chemical Works, for the use of J. N. Payne and his wife, Kate G. Payne, in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Tennessee, against J. N. Oliver and others, partners constituting the firm of Oliver, Finnie &amp; Co., to recover damages for the infringement by the defendants for the period from April 1, 1870, to February 1, 1874, of the rights of the said Kate G. Payne and her husband under said patent, by making and selling self-raising flour by the use of Horsford's patent pulverulent phosphoric acid in the territory before named. The theory of the suit was that the right of Morgan became vested in his administratrix as a personal asset, and continued under the extension, and that the suit brought would lie for infringements of such right committed prior to the expiration of the five years from February 1, 1869. The suit was tried by a jury and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs for $3,538.97 damages, and a judgment in their favor for that amount, with costs. To review that judgment this writ of error is brought.</p>\n      <p><i>B. M. Estes</i> and <i>H. T. Ellete</i>, for plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>George Gantt, Isham G.

The court charged the jury that the interest of Morgan in the patent did not terminate at his death, but passed to his administratrix. The defendants excepted to this charge. The evidence was that Morgan died on the nineteenth of April, 1869, and the defendants asked the court to instruct the jury that the privilege conferred on Morgan by the instrument of February 1, 1869, from the Rumford Chemical Works to him, terminated at his death, and did not pass to his administratrix, and that they should find for the defendants if they believed that Morgan died on the nineteenth of April, 1869. The court refused to give such instruction, and the defendants excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that what was granted to Morgan was only the exclusive right to use, within the territory specified, the patented acid in making self-raising flour, and to use and sell in said territory the flour so made. The acid used in making the self-raising flour was all of it to be purchased from the Rumford Chemical Works or its agents. No right was granted to make the acid, or to use it or sell it otherwise than as an ingredient in the self-raising flour. The effect of the grant made by the two instruments of February 1, 1869, is subject to the provisions of section 11 of the act of July 4, 1836, (5 St. at Large, 121,) which was the statute in force at the time, and provided as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Every patent shall be assignable at law, either as to the whole interest or any undivided part thereof, by any      instrument in writing; which assignment, and also every grant      and conveyance of the exclusive right under any patent, to      make and use, and to grant to others to make and use, the      thing patented within and throughout any specified part or      portion of the United States, shall be recorded in the      patent-office within three months from the execution      thereof.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By section 14 of the same act it was provided that damages for making, using, or selling the thing whereof the exclusive right is secured by a patent, 'may be recovered by action on the case, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought in the name or names of the person or persons interested, whether as patentees, assignees. or as grantees of the exclusive right within any throughout a specified part of the United States.' Morgan was not an assignee of the entire right secured by the patent, nor of any undivided part of such entire right, nor of the exclusive interest in such entire right for the territory specified. He did not acquire the whole of the exclusive right or legal estate vested in the Rumford Chemical Works by the patent for the said territory, leaving no interest in his grantor for that territory, as to anything granted by the patent. It is well settled that a transfer of a right such as Morgan acquired is not an assignment, nor such a grant of exclusive right as the statute speaks of, but is a mere license. Curtis, Pat. (3d Ed.) &#167; 179; <i>Gayler</i> v. <i>Wilder</i>, 10 How. 477, 494. This being so, the instrument of license is not one which will carry the right conferred to any one but the licensee personally, unless there are express words to show an intent to extend the right to an executor, administrator, or assignee, voluntary or involuntary. In <i>Troy Iron &amp; Nail Factory</i> v. <i>Corning</i>, 14 How. 193, 216, this court said: 'A mere license to a party, without having 'his assigns' or equivalent words to them, showing that it was meant to be assignable, is only the grant of a personal power to the licensee, and is not transferable by him to another.' *In the present case there are no words of assignability in either instrument. The right is granted to Morgan alone, to him personally, with an agreement by him that <i>he</i> will enter on the manufacture of the self-raising flour, and that he will use all <i>his</i> business tact and skill to introduce and sell the flour. It is apparent that licenses of this character must have been granted to such individuals as the grantor chose to select because of their personal ability or qualifications to make or furnish a market for the self-raising flour, and thus for the acid, all of which was to be purchased from the grantor. The license was made revocable by the grantor on the failure of Morgan to perform his covenants and agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not overlooked the fact that the privilege granted to Morgan was to continue for five years. This means no more than that he was to have it for five years, if he should live so long, and if the patent should not have expired. But it cannot have the effect to impart assignability to the privilege, or to prolong its duration beyond that of his life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respect for the supreme court of Tennessee induces us to say that we have carefully examined the opinion of that court in <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, 10 Heisk. 322. That was a suit brought by the widow and administratrix of Morgan against Oliver, Finnie &amp; Co., in a court of the state, to recover compensation under an agreement made between him and them, February 15, 1869, and which was to continue till April 1, 1870, whereby he was to prepare self-raising flour for them under the license to him from the Rumford Chemical Works, and they were to pay him so much a barrel. In that suit it was held that Mrs. Morgan could recover not only for the time prior to Morgan's death, but for the subsequent time, and that the license to Morgan vested in him an interest which passed, at his death, to his personal representative. The proceedings in that suit are made a part of the record on this writ of error; but the suit in the circuit court was tried wholly on the view that the question as to the construction of the instruments of February 1, 1869, was an open one, and was a question of general law, and not one as to a rule of property, and that there was nothing in the former suit which, as <i>res adjudicata</i>, could be binding between the parties in this suit as an estoppel. There is nothing in the pleadings which raises the question of such an estoppel. The lower state court having, in the prior suit, rendered a judgment for the plaintiff, the supreme court of the state, while giving the interpretation before mentioned of the rights of Morgan, reversed the judgment for errors in other respects, and awarded a new trial. Afterwards there was, in the lower court, a verdict by consent, followed by a judgment for the plaintiff, for a less sum than the amount of the first verdict and judgment. Moreover, the present suit is one in a court of the United States, brought under the provisions of an act of congress, for the infringement of letters patent. The former suit arose out of a contract between Morgan and Oliver, Finnie &amp; Co., and was brought to recover damages for the breach of that contract. Under these circumstances, the question as to the rights of Morgan under the patent must be regarded as one to be passed upon in this suit as an original question, as if there had been no former suit. Giving to the opinion of the supreme court of Tennessee that consideration which is due to the force of reasoning in the views which it announces, we are unable to concur in the construction it gave to the license to Morgan. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed, with direction to award a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>109 U.S. 75 (1883)</b></center>\n<center><h1>OLIVER &amp; Others<br>\nv.<br>\nRUMFORD CHEMICAL WORKS.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued October 10th and 11th, 1883.</center>\n<center>Decided October 29th, 1883.</center>\nIN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> <i>Mr. Estes</i> and <i>Mr. Ellett</i> for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. George Gantt</i> and <i>Mr. Isham G.

The effect of the grant made by the two instruments of February 1st, 1869, is subject to the provisions of § 11 of the act of July 4th, 1836, 5 Stat. 121, which was the statute in force at the time, and provided as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Every patent shall be assignable at law, either as to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> whole interest or any undivided part thereof, by any instrument in writing; which assignment, and also every grant and conveyance of the exclusive right under any patent, to make and use, and to grant to others to make and use, the thing patented within and throughout any specified part or portion of the United States, shall be recorded in the Patent Office within three months from the execution thereof.\"</p>\n<p>By § 14 of the same act it was provided that damages for making, using or selling the thing whereof the exclusive right is secured by a patent:</p>\n<p>\"May be recovered by action on the case, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought in the name or names of the person or persons interested, whether as patentees, assignees or as grantees of the exclusive right within and throughout a specified part of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>Morgan was not an assignee of the entire right secured by the patent, nor of any undivided part of such entire right, nor of the exclusive interest in such entire right for the territory specified. He did not acquire the whole of the exclusive right or legal estate vested in the Rumford Chemical Works by the patent for the said territory, leaving no interest in his grantor for that territory, as to anything granted by the patent. It is well settled that a transfer of a right such as Morgan acquired is not an assignment, nor such a grant of exclusive right as the statute speaks of, but is a mere license. Curtis on Patents, 3d ed. § 179; <i>Gayler</i> v. <i>Wilder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86619\"><a href=\"/opinion/86619/gayler-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 494. This being so, the instrument of license is not one which will carry the right conferred to any one but the licensee personally, unless there are express words to show an intent to extend the right to an executor, administrator or assignee, voluntary or involuntary.</p>\n<p>In <i>Troy Iron and Nail Factory</i> v. <i>Corning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86779\"><a href=\"/opinion/86779/troy-iron-nail-factory-v-corning/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 216, this court said:</p>\n<p>\"A mere license to a party, without having his assigns or equivalent words to them, showing that it was meant to be assignable, is only the grant of a personal power to the licensee, and is not transferable by him to another.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> In the present case there are no words of assignability in either instrument. The right is granted to Morgan alone, to him personally, with an agreement by him that <i>he</i> will enter on the manufacture of the self-raising flour, and that he will use all <i>his</i> business tact and skill to introduce and sell the flour. It is apparent that licenses of this character must have been granted to such individuals as the grantor chose to select because of their personal ability or qualifications to make or furnish a market for the self-raising flour, and thus for the acid, all of which was to be purchased from the grantor. The license was made revocable by the grantor on the failure of Morgan to perform his covenants and agreements.</p>\n<p>We have not overlooked the fact that the privilege granted to Morgan was to continue for five years. This means no more than that he was to have it for five years, if he should live so long, and if the patent should not have expired. But it cannot have the effect to impart assignability to the privilege, or to prolong its duration beyond that of his life.</p>\n<p>Respect for the Supreme Court of Tennessee induces us to say that we have carefully examined the opinion of that court in <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> 10 Heiskell, 322. That was a suit brought by the widow and administratrix of Morgan against Oliver, Finnie &amp; Co., in a court of the State, to recover compensation under an agreement made between him and them February 15th, 1869, and which was to continue till April 1st, 1870, whereby he was to prepare self-raising flour for them under the license to him from the Rumford Chemical Works, and they were to pay him so much a barrel. In that suit it was held that Mrs. Morgan could recover not only for the time prior to Morgan's death, but for the subsequent time, and that the license to Morgan vested in him an interest which passed, at his death, to his personal representative. The proceedings in that suit are made a part of the record on this writ of error. But the suit in the circuit court was tried wholly on the view that the question as to the construction of the instruments of February 1st, 1869, was an open one, and was a question of general law, and not one as to a rule of property, and that there was nothing in the former suit which, as <i>res judicata,</i> could be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> binding between the parties in this suit, as an estoppel. There is nothing in the pleadings which raises the question of such an estoppel. The lower State court having, in the prior suit, rendered a judgment for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court of the State, while giving the interpretation before mentioned of the rights of Morgan, reversed the judgment for errors in other respects, and awarded a new trial. Afterwards there was, in the lower court, a verdict by consent, followed by a judgment for the plaintiff, for a less sum than the amount of the first verdict and judgment. Moreover, the present suit is one in a court of the United States, brought under the provisions of an act of Congress, for the infringement of letters patent. The former suit arose out of a contract between Morgan and Oliver, Finnie &amp; Co., and was brought to recover damages for the breach of that contract. Under these circumstances, the question as to the rights of Morgan under the patent must be regarded as one to be passed upon in this suit as an original question, as if there had been no former suit. Giving to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that consideration which is due to the force of reasoning in the views which it announces, we are unable to concur in the construction it gave to the license to Morgan. Accordingly:</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, with direction to award a new trial.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 90900, "judges": "Blatchford", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/90900/", "sha1": "6ba5aac1c899a98cedcd1943ebcb4a7af4d5e302", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:45"}
