In order to effectuate the conservation policy of the President, the Secretary of the Interior by a general order either rejected or refused to receive their applications. Thereupon, these proceedings were begun in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia. They seek writs of mandamus to compel the Secretary to receive or reinstate the applications and act upon each according to its merits.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*419</span> Answering, the Secretary admitted issuance of the general order and action thereunder. All this he claimed was done in pursuance of the authority vested in him by law. The Supreme Court of the District held against him and ordered receipt or reinstatement of petitioner's applications followed by definite action thereon. The Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion and reversed the judgments.</p>\n<p>The answers aver \"that under the Act, [1920] the granting of a prospecting permit for oil and gas is discretionary with the Secretary of the Interior, and any application may be granted or denied, either in part or in its entirety as the facts may be deemed to warrant.\" Having examined the Act we cannot say that by any clear and indisputable language it refutes his position. Certainly, there is ground for a plausible, if not conclusive, argument that so far as it relates to the leasing of oil lands it goes no further than to empower the Secretary to execute leases which, exercising a reasonable discretion, he may think would promote the public welfare.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary now to declare the precise meaning of the relevant provisions of the Act. It was passed when according to a widely accepted view decline of petroleum production in the United States was imminent. In fact, there has been an enormous increase and a consequent troublesome surplus. Looking only at its words one may interpret § 13 as the Secretary says he did. And this conclusion is aided by consideration of his general powers over the public lands as guardian of the people. § 441, R.S.; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Grimaud,</i> 220 U.S. 506; <i>Williams</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 138 U.S. 514; <i>Knight</i> v. <i>U.S. Land Assn.,</i> 142 U.S. 161; also the right of the President to withdraw public lands from private appropriation. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Midwest Oil Co.,</i> 236 U.S. 459; Withdrawal Act, 1910, 36 Stat. 847.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> Under the established rule the writ of mandamus cannot be made to serve the purpose of an ordinary suit. It will issue only where the duty to be performed is ministerial and the obligation to act peremptory, and plainly defined. The law must not only authorize the demanded action, but require it; the duty must be clear and indisputable. <i>U.S. ex rel.
