S. C., tit. 28, &#167; 380 (28 USCA &#167; 380)). Holding that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, the court granted an injunction with respect to notes made outside the state, but denied relief as to notes which were signed within the state. 44 F.(2d) 64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no controversy as to the facts, which were stipulated and found by the court substantially as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'These notes were executed at various times from July 24,      1923, to March 12, 1930. The notes were all payable to banks,      at their banking houses, respectively, outside of South      Carolina; none of them being located or doing any business      within that state. The custom and practice between the      plaintiff and each of the banks was that in each instance, at      the office of the bank, a line of credit was first      established; that is, an agreement was made that the      plaintiff's borrowing from the bank should never exceed a      certain amount, each specific loan to be made thereafter      being subject to acceptance by the bank. When a loan was      desired, the bank having been notified that a loan would be      desired at a certain date and an inquiry having been made of      it as to the then existing discount rate, the note would be      signed by the president or other executive officer of the      plaintiff, and forwarded to the bank by mail. The note was      subject to withdrawal and revocation by the plaintiff until      it was actually received and accepted by the bank and the      proceeds actually placed to the credit of the plaintiff in      the bank. * * * Payment of the note was made to the bank at its banking house by the plaintiff      sending checks from its office at Graniteville upon other      banks; and when the note was paid, it was marked paid, or      canceled, and returned to the plaintiff at Graniteville, S.

Prior to December 1, 1924, the      plaintiff's executive officers resided in Angusta, Ga., and      all of its notes, up to that time, were signed by its      executive officers in Augusta, Ga., and mailed from there to      banks outside of South Carolina, and those notes were never      in the state of South Carolina until after they were paid and      returned to the plaintiff at its office at Graniteville, S.      C. But after December 1, 1924, plaintiff's executive officers      resided at Graniteville, S. C., and the notes executed      subsequent to that time were signed by those officers at      Graniteville, S.
