The original indictment charging him was returned on May 4, 1982.  A superseding indictment was filed on August 17, 1982, and a second superseding indictment was filed on April 21, 1983.

Petitioner argued that &#167; 3161(c)(2) precluded commencement of his trial until 30 days elapsed following the return of the last indictment.

In this case, however, the Fifth Circuit upheld petitioner's conviction, finding that a different rule applies when the prior indictment is dismissed on the motion of the Government:  The minimum time limit runs from the original, not superseding, indictment, and any continuance is left to the discretion of the district judge.  This holding is consistent with the view of the Seventh Circuit, <i>United States v. Horton,</i> 676 F.2d 1165, 1169 (1982), the Second Circuit, <i>United States v.

In <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 724 F.2d 1452 (1984), the Ninth Circuit held that the 30-day period applies even when the Government obtains an overlapping, superseding indictment.
