There was no allegation that Johnson rendered any labor or service in consequence of the arrest.

And in order to reach the opposite conclusion, this Court labels the statutory language as \"inartistic\" and as lacking in \"strict grammatical construction.\" It then proceeds to rewrite the statute, in conformity with what it conceives to have been the original intention of Congress, so as to penalize \"whoever . . . arrests . . . any person for the purpose of placing him in a condition of peonage.\" I cannot assent to this judicial revision of a criminal law. Congress alone has power to amend or clarify the criminal sanctions of a statute.</p>\n<p>Apologia for inadequate legislative draftsmanship and reliance on the admitted evils of peonage cannot replace the right of each individual to a fair warning from Congress as to those actions for which penalties are inflicted. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> Punishment without clear legislative authority might conceivably contain more potential seeds of oppression than the arrest of a person \"to a condition of peonage.\"</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  50 F.
