The second count charged the same taking by use of a dangerous weapon, and the third alleged a conspiracy of petitioner with others to commit the offenses set out in the first two counts. Petitioner was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on count one, and a year and a day on each of counts two and three, the three sentences to run consecutively. He took no appeal, but two years later moved in the trial court to set aside the sentence on the first count on the ground that the offense charged in the first was included in that charged in the second. The District Court denied the motion, holding that its jurisdiction of the cause ended with the term of court in which petitioner was sentenced. 38 F. Supp. 610.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> After the lapse of more than the five days prescribed by Rule III of the Rules in Criminal Cases, but less than the three months prescribed by \u00a7 8 (c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 230, petitioner filed a notice of appeal and asked leave to appeal <i>in forma pauperis,</i> which the District Court allowed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order denying petitioner's application \"upon the grounds and for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the District Judge.\" 124 F.2d 1019. We granted certiorari on a petition filed more than thirty days after the entry of judgment by the court below, and requested counsel, in presenting the case here, to discuss the questions whether the time for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and for petition for certiorari to this Court are governed by the Rules in Criminal Cases, and if not what statute applies.</p>\n<p>Rule XI of the Criminal Rules provides that \"Petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the appellate court shall be made within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment of that court.\" If the judgment of the Court of Appeals is one to which Rule XI applies, the petition for certiorari was filed too late and we are without jurisdiction. Petitioner insists that the present proceeding is one not embraced in the Criminal Rules since they make no provision governing the appeal from the order of the District Court; that, consequently, certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, as in other proceedings not within the Criminal Rules, is governed by \u00a7 8 (a) of the Act of February 13, 1925, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 350, which allows three months for filing the petition.

But the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is a judgment in a criminal proceeding after verdict and judgment of conviction, and the petition for certiorari to review the judgment is a \"subsequent proceeding\" in such a case to which Rule XI specifically applies.</p>\n<p>We see no reason for excepting the petition for certiorari from the thirty-day limitation of Rule XI merely because the draftsmen omitted to provide in Rule III for an appeal from the order of the District Court in cases like the present.
