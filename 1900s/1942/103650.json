In the District Court, a demurrer to an indictment was sustained on the sole ground that \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Hatch Act, \"An Act to prevent pernicious political activities\" approved August 2, 1939, 53 Stat. 1147, set out below,<sup>[1]</sup> were inapplicable to a state primary.<sup>[2]</sup> Neither the assignment of errors nor the jurisdictional statement specifies any other statute under which the indictment might have been found.</p>\n<p>Defendants, employees of the Works Progress Administration and a municipal Chief of Police, were indicted under Count I for threatening, on May 6, 1940, to deprive a named person of employment, made possible by an Act of Congress, unless he voted for and supported in the Florida primary, defendants' candidates for various national and state offices, and under Count II for promising on May 23rd continued and more remunerative employment if that person did support them. In each count it was alleged that: \"Frank M.

See also \u00a7 30 (b) of that Act and \u00a7 3 (a) of the Joint Resolution of February 4, 1939, making an additional appropriation for work relief for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, 53 Stat. 507, 508.
