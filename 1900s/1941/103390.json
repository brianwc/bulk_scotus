The Commissioner assessed the renewal commissions paid by the companies to the assignees in 1933 as income taxable to the assignor in that year under the provisions of the 1932 Revenue Act, 47 Stat. 169, \u00a7 22 of which does not differ in any respect now material from \u00a7 22 of the 1934 Revenue Act involved in the <i>Horst</i> case.

The judgment below is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>The separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS.</p>\n<p>The cause was decided upon stipulated facts. The following statement taken from the court's opinion discloses the issues.</p>\n<p>\"The question presented is whether renewal commissions payable to a general agent of a life insurance company after the termination of his agency and by him assigned prior to the taxable year, must be included in his income despite the assignment.</p>\n<p>\"During part of the year 1924 the petitioner was employed by the Canada Life Assurance Company as its branch manager for the state of Michigan. His compensation consisted of a salary plus certain commissions. His employment terminated on September 1, 1924. Under the terms of his contract he was entitled to renewal commissions on premiums thereafter collected by the company on policies written prior to the termination of his agency, without the obligation to perform any further services. In November 1924 he assigned his right, title, and interest in the contract as well as the renewal commissions to a corporate trustee. From September 1, 1924 to June 30, 1927, the petitioner and another, constituting the firm of Hart &amp; Eubank, were general agents in New York City for the Aetna Life Assurance Company, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> and from July 1, 1927 to August 31, 1927, the petitioner individually was general agent for said Aetna Company. The Aetna contracts likewise contained terms entitling the agent to commissions on renewal premiums paid after termination of the agency, without the performance of any further services. On March 28, 1928, the petitioner assigned to the corporate trustee all commissions to become due him under the Aetna contracts. During the year 1933 the trustee collected by virtue of the assignments renewal commissions payable under the three agency contracts above mentioned, amounting to some $15,600. These commissions were taxed to the petitioner by the Commissioner, and the Board has sustained the deficiency resulting therefrom.\" 110 F.2d 738.</p>\n<p>The court below declared \u0097</p>\n<p>\"In the case at bar the petitioner owned a right to receive money for past services; no further services were required. Such a right is assignable. At the time of assignment there was nothing contingent in the petitioner's right, although the amount collectible in future years was still uncertain and contingent. But this may be equally true where the assignment transfers a right to income from investments, as in <i>Blair</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i> 300 U.S. 5, and <i>Horst</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i> 107 F.2d 906 (C.C.A. 2), or a right to patent royalties, as in <i>Nelson</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 56 F.2d 121 (C.C.A. 3), certiorari denied, 286 U.S. 565. By an assignment of future earnings a taxpayer may not escape taxation upon his compensation in the year when he earns it. But when a taxpayer who makes his income tax return on a cash basis assigns a right to money payable in the future for work already performed, we believe that he transfers a property right, and the money, when received by the assignee, is not income taxable to the assignor.\"</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Board of Tax Appeals was reversed; and this, I think, is in accord with the statute and our opinions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> The assignment in question denuded the assignor of all right to commissions thereafter to accrue under the contract with the insurance company.

The right to collect became the absolute property of the assignee without relation to future action by the assignor.</p>\n<p>A mere right to collect future payments, for services already performed, is not presently taxable as \"income derived\" from such services.
