Failing to secure the assents required by &#167; 75, sub. g, petitioner amended her petition in November, 1938, to proceed under &#167; 75, sub. s. Respondent then moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioner was not a 'farmer' and therefore was not entitled to the relief afforded by &#167; 75, sub. s. After a hearing, the District Court sustained the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that the formula for determining whether petitioner was a farmer was to be found in &#167; 1(17) of the Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840, 841, and that petitioner could not be regarded as a farmer within its terms. 1 Cir., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></span>, on rehearing, 109 F.2d 750.

Section 1(17) of the Chandler revision provides: \"Farmer' shall mean an individual personally engaged in farming or tillage of the soil, and shall include an individual personally engaged in dairy farming or in the productions of poultry, livestock, or poultry or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, if the principal part of his income is derived from any one or more of  uch operations.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 75, sub. r, as amended in 1935, 49 Stat. 246, provides: 'For the purposes of this section, section 4(b), and section 74, the term 'farmer' includes not only an individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil, but also any individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in dairy farming, the production of poultry or livestock, or the production of poultry products or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of whose income is derived from any one or more of the foregoing operations, and includes the personal representative of a deceased farmer * * *.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the premise that only one of the definitions can stand, respondent contends that &#167; 1(17) is an implicit repeal of &#167; 75, sub. r. To support the contention, respondent points to the obsolete reference in &#167; 75, sub. r to &#167; 74, 11 U.S.C.A. &#167; 202, and to a statement in a committee report which is said to indicate that Congress intended the definition in &#167; 1(17) to measure the applicability of &#167; 4, sub. b, 11 U.S.C.A. &#167; 22, sub. b, to persons who claim to be farmers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument ignores the plain import of &#167; 75, sub. r. The meaning of the phrase 'for the purposes of this section' is hardly open to question. Obviously, it is neither impossible nor necessarily inconsistent to prescribe one definition for a particular section or sections and another for the balance of the Act. Nor is the applicability of &#167; 75, sub. r to proceedings under &#167; 75 seriously placed in doubt because the former section refers to a section which no longer exists under that number and to a section which now may be governed by &#167; 1(17). The only question here is whether &#167; 75, sub. r or &#167; 1(17) is applicable to &#167; 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 75, with immaterial differences, first appeared in the distressed-debtor legislation of 1933. 47 Stat. 1467, 1470&#8212;1473.

At that time a special committee held extensive hearings on a proposal to make &#167; 75 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Act, and finally concluded that the section should be continued only as temporary legislation.
