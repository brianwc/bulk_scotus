A section of the new law, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 236.251 (Supp. 1970), known as the \"Millage Rollback Law,\" provided that, to be eligible to receive state moneys, a local school district must limit <i>ad valorem</i> taxes for school purposes to not more than 10 mills of assessed valuation, with certain exceptions. Appellees filed this class action in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging that the Millage Rollback Law effected an invidious discrimination, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, against school children of property-poor counties in that 10 mills of <i>ad valorem</i> tax in school districts in such counties would produce less dollars per child for educational purposes than would 10 mills of <i>ad valorem</i> tax in other counties. A three-judge District Court entered a summary judgment in appellees' favor upon a declaration that the Millage Rollback Law was unconstitutional, and enjoined the appellants from withholding state funds from any school district by virtue of the provisions of that Act. <i>Hargrave</i> v. <i>Kirk,</i> 313 F.

That action attacks the Millage Rollback Law primarily on state law grounds, as violative of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> provisions of the Florida Constitution. The District Court, however, rejected appellants' argument that the court \"should abstain from considering the case in deference to [the] state court proceeding,\" 313 F.

S. 668 (1963), \"[t]he fact that a state remedy is available is not a valid basis for federal court abstention.\" 313 F. Supp., at 947. The reliance upon <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i> and <i>McNeese</i> was misplaced. <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i> is not in point, for there \"the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice.\" 365 U. S., at 174. <i>McNeese</i> held that \"assertion of a federal claim in a federal court [need not] await an attempt to vindicate <i>the same claim</i> in a state court.\" 373 U.

Our understanding from the colloquy on oral argument with counsel for the parties is that the <i>Christian</i> case asserts, not the \"same claim,\" that is, the federal claim of alleged denial of the federal right of equal protection, but primarily state law claims under the Florida Constitution, which claims, if sustained, will obviate the necessity of determining the Fourteenth Amendment question. In such case, the line of decisions of which <i>Reetz</i> v. <i>Bozanich,</i> 397 U.
