The dissent noted that the <i>Spaziano</i> jury \"may well [have been] sufficiently convinced of [Spaziano's] guilt to convict him, but nevertheless also sufficiently troubled by the possibility that an irrevocable mistake might be made . . . that [it] concluded that a sentence of death could not be morally justified in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 488, n. 34, 104 S.Ct., at 3177, n. 34.  We did not then realize, however, that Florida seems to have denigrated this wholly proper mitigating factor as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing in sharp contradistinction to the <i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett</i> holdings, the refusal by Florida courts to consider this valid factor should be reviewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this legal issue might arise in a sentencing scheme that respected the finality of a jury decision against death, it is not necessarily an accident that this case came from Florida's system, where judges may override jury decisions for life.  In <i>Spaziano,</i> which upheld the Florida system, the dissent cited data showing that judges are usually more likely to impose death than are juries.  468 U.S., at 488, n. 34, 104 S.Ct., at 3177, n. 34. Where fully informed and rational juries decide that death is inappropriate, a judge's override rarely if ever shows that, in spite of the jury, there was really no reasonable doubt but that death was appropriate.  It is far more likely that the override decision simply fails to account for the more intangible or less traditionally \"legal\" elements of mitigation that informed a jury's decision.  This case seems a clear illustration.  Indeed, the <i>Spaziano</i> dissent correctly suspected that a system of death sentencing by judges&#8212;\"trained to distinguish proof of guilt from questions concerning sentencing\"&#8212;would be less likely to recognize this valid mitigating circumstance.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett</i> entitle a defendant to a sentencer who can consider <i>all</i> mitigating circumstances, whether or not they conform to traditional legal categories.  The weight assigned to any element can only be a function of the values of the community, for certainly there is no \"objective\" formula.  Once a mitigating circumstance is considered, assigned weight, and determined to be sufficient to preclude death, the Constitution should allow no \"superior\" authority to remove that circumstance from the equation and impose death.  To allow a judge to override a jury decision for life&#8212;as this Court did in <i>Spaziano</i> &#8212;not only places the defendant in the fundamentally unfair position of having to repetitively justify the appropriateness of one's continued life, it also facilitates the denigration of a variety of mitigating circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only a narrow reliance on legal formalism could lead one to question whether doubts as to guilt can be insufficient to preclude acquittal but sufficient to preclude death.  The judge here concluded that the jury confronted the horror of sending to his death a defendant who might be innocent.  But rather than accept that this was weighty logic in favor of life, he assumed that it was a form of logic that should be declared invalid by Florida courts.  I dissent from the denial of the petition in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Florida,</i> 468 U.S. 447, 467, 104 S.Ct. 3154, 3166, 82 L.Ed.2d 340 (1984).  The dissent noted that the <i>Spaziano</i> jury \"may well [have been] sufficiently convinced of [Spaziano's] guilt to convict him, but nevertheless also sufficiently troubled by the possibility that an irrevocable mistake might be made . . . that [it] concluded that a sentence of death could not be morally justified in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 488, n. 34, 104 S.Ct., at 3177, n. 34.  We did not then realize, however, that Florida seems to have denigrated this wholly proper mitigating factor as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing in sharp contradistinction to the <i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett</i> holdings, the refusal by Florida courts to consider this valid factor should be reviewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this legal issue might arise in a sentencing scheme that respected the finality of a jury decision against death, it is not necessarily an accident that this case came from Florida's system, where judges may override jury decisions for life.  In <i>Spaziano,</i> which upheld the Florida system, the dissent cited data showing that judges are usually more likely to impose death than are juries.  468 U.S., at 488, n. 34, 104 S.Ct., at 3177, n. 34. Where fully informed and rational juries decide that death is inappropriate, a judge's override rarely if ever shows that, in spite of the jury, there was really no reasonable doubt but that death was appropriate.  It is far more likely that the override decision simply fails to account for the more intangible or less traditionally \"legal\" elements of mitigation that informed a jury's decision.  This case seems a clear illustration.  Indeed, the <i>Spaziano</i> dissent correctly suspected that a system of death sentencing by judges&#8212;\"trained to distinguish proof of guilt from questions concerning sentencing\"&#8212;would be less likely to recognize this valid mitigating circumstance.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Eddings</i> and <i>Lockett</i> entitle a defendant to a sentencer who can consider <i>all</i> mitigating circumstances, whether or not they conform to traditional legal categories.  The weight assigned to any element can only be a function of the values of the community, for certainly there is no \"objective\" formula.  Once a mitigating circumstance is considered, assigned weight, and determined to be sufficient to preclude death, the Constitution should allow no \"superior\" authority to remove that circumstance from the equation and impose death.  To allow a judge to override a jury decision for life&#8212;as this Court did in <i>Spaziano</i> &#8212;not only places the defendant in the fundamentally unfair position of having to repetitively justify the appropriateness of one's continued life, it also facilitates the denigration of a variety of mitigating circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only a narrow reliance on legal formalism could lead one to question whether doubts as to guilt can be insufficient to preclude acquittal but sufficient to preclude death.  The judge here concluded that the jury confronted the horror of sending to his death a defendant who might be innocent.  But rather than accept that this was weighty logic in favor of life, he assumed that it was a form of logic that should be declared invalid by Florida courts.  I dissent from the denial of the petition in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
