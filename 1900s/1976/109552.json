Also present in the apartment was a woman who was sitting on a couch in the same room.

Indeed, one police officer testified that he did not find \"any indications of ownership of the apartment.\" In his closing argument on the merits, however, the prosecutor placed substantial emphasis on the out-of-court declaration of the unidentified informant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(A) confidential informant came to Detective Uribe and said,      'I have information or I have through personal observation,      know that John David Moore resides at a certain apartment      here in El Paso, Texas, and he is in possession of a certain      amount of heroin.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In adjudging Moore guilty, the trial court found that he had been in close proximity to the seized heroin, that he was the tenant of the apartment in question, and that he had, therefore, been in possession of the contraband.

Introduction of this testimony deprived Moore of the opportunity to cross-examine the informant as to exactly what he meant by \"Moore's apartment,\" and what factual basis, if any, there was for believing that Moore was a tenant or regular resident there. Moore was similarly deprived of the chance to show that the witness' recollection was erroneous or that he was not credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The informant's declaration falls within no exception to the hearsay rule recognized in the Federal Rules of Evidence, and reliance on this hearsay statement in determining petitioner's guilt or innocence was error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the only competent evidence of Moore's possession of the narcotics was his proximity to them in an apartment in which another person was also present and of which he was not shown to be the tenant or even a regular resident, the Solicitor General now argues that the error in admitting the hearsay evidence was harmless.
