The bank defended upon the theory that, exercising rights given by section 12 of the National Bank Act (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 102; R. S. &#167; 5139 [Comp. St. &#167; 9676]), she transferred the stock to her husband, and in turn he had hypothecated it to secure his personal note. Being of opinion that the National Bank Act did not inhibit an inquiry concerning all the circumstances, the trial court permitted introduction of proof to that end; the jury found the bank had knowledge of facts sufficient to charge it with notice that the transaction amounted to a contract of suretyship by the wife; and judgment in her favor was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. A petition to rehear was overruled May 18, 1917, and at that time the judgment below became final for purposes of review here. Andrews v. Virginian Railway Co., 248 U. S. 272, 39 Sup. Ct. 101, 63 L.

Section 2 (Comp. St. &#167; 1214). It also authorized this court to bring up for review and determination by certiorari 'any cause wherein a final judgment or decree has been rendered or passed by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is against their validity.' And it further distinctly directed that, except as to writs of certiorari addressed to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, 'no writ of error, appeal, or writ of certiorari intended to bring up any cause for review by the Supreme Court shall be allowed or entertained unless duly applied for within three months after entry of the judgment or decree complained of.'
