He went down with the \"Cyclops\" March 31, 1918, and the full amount of the policy, payable in monthly installments, was awarded to plaintiff Crouch as her guardian. Another award of twenty-five dollars per month was made to him, as such guardian, on account of the husband's death.</p>\n<p>Payments were regularly made until July 12, 1921, when the Bureau of War Risk Insurance gave notice that the beneficiary had terminated her claims for both insurance and compensation by misconduct. Thereupon the guardian commenced this proceeding in the District Court. The petition prays for judgment against the United States and that they be directed to pay all installments which have or may accrue. The trial judge concluded that by misconduct the widow had terminated her right to the insurance as of September 17, 1920; further, that the United States had not consented to be sued upon the award of compensation; and it dismissed the petition, April 7, 1922. The cause went to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court, being of opinion that it was without jurisdiction, transferred the proceeding here. Act of September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837.</p>\n<p>Article III, Act of October 6, 1917, provides for compensation where death occurs in the line of duty. Section 305 declares, \"That upon its own motion or upon application the bureau may at any time review an award, and, in accordance with the facts found upon such review, may end, diminish, or increase the compensation previously awarded, or, if compensation has been refused or discontinued, may award compensation.\"</p>\n<p>No authority to sue the United States for compensation has been expressly granted, and that none exists under circumstances like those here presented is determined by <i>Silberschein</i> v. <i>United States,</i> decided today, <i>post,</i> 221.</p>\n<p>Article IV, Act of October 6, 1917, provides generally for the insurance of officers and enlisted men.
