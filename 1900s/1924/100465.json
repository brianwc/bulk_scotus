The south bank of the river is the waterwashed and      relatively permanent elevation or acclivity, commonly called      a cut bank, along the southerly side of the river which      separates its bed from the adjacent upland, whether valley or      hill, and usually serves to confine the waters within the bed      and to preserve the course of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'6. The boundary between the two states is on and along that      bank at the mean level attained by the waters of the river      when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'7. The exceptional places where there is no well defined cut      bank, but only a gradual incline from the sand bed of the      river to the upland, the boundary is a line over such incline      conforming to the mean level of the waters when at other      places in that vicinity they reach and wash the cut bank      without overflowing it.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing specifications applied in the light of the      opinion, admit of, and require the exercise of practical      judgment in determining the line intended; but certain      fundamentals, such as the following, obviously must form the      final basis for the exact location of the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boundary line is a gradient of the flowing water in the      river. It is located midway between the lower level of the      flowing water that just reaches the cut bank, and the higher      level of it that just does not overtop the cut bank. The      physical top of the cut bank being very uneven in profile,      cannot be a datum for locating the boundary line; but a      gradient along the bank must be used for that purpose. The highest point on this gradient      must not be higher than the lowest acceptable point on the      bank in that vicinity. The boundary line has been determined      accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have marked the boundary line by wooden posts called      'witness posts' set along the bank at varying short distances      from the boundary, and from each other. A bearing and      distance has been taken from each witness post to one or more      points on the boundary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Permanent reference monuments are located at varying      intervals on the Texas bluff overlooking the river valley.

Similarly the      Texas monuments are joined to each other and to the Oklahoma      monuments, which in turn, are joined to each other and to the      witness posts. Permanent bench marks located near the      boundary are also joined to the witness posts and to the      reference monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All oil wells within three hundred feet of the boundary have      been accurately located upon the ground, and the position of      each, whether in Texas or in Oklahoma, is stated. From each      oil well, a bearing and distance is given to a point on the      boundary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boundary line is shown by the usual symbol and      appropriate wording on the accompanying maps, which also show      the positions of the witness posts, the oil wells, the      reference monuments, the bench marks and other information      usually appearing on such maps.

S. 505, 43 Sup. Ct. 701, 67 L. Ed. 1094), we have surveyed and run upon the ground and have delineated upon an appropriate map the medial line between the state boundary along the south bank of Red river and the northerly bank thereof for a distance of three miles in the vicinity of the river bed oil wells, and we beg to submit this joint report of that work, with field notes and map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p332\">\n      <span class=\"num\">332</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The survey was begun June 29, 1923, and completed February 17, 1924. The location of the medial line, as so established and delineated, conforms to the physical situation existing on December 31, 1923, the date as of which we ran, located and marked the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the reveivership oil area as shown and described in our report thereof filed contemporaneously with this report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p333\">\n      <span class=\"num\">333</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides locating the state boundary along the south bank as shown in the other report, a meander line of the north bank was run in the usual manner, for purposes of accurate platting and to aid in determining the location of the medial line. Temporary markers were placed at the angle points along the north bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p334\">\n      <span class=\"num\">334</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The establishment of the medial line conforms specifically to the provisions of the fifth paragraph of the decree of March 12, 1923 (261 U. S. 345, 43 Sup. Ct. 376, 67 L. Ed. 687), entitled 'Supplement to Partial Decree of June 5, 1922,' which paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p335\">\n      <span class=\"num\">335</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'5. In the sense intended herein, the medial line of the river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks, save that, under a stipulation between the parties affected, to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall be regarded and treated as falling no farther north than the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were patented or allotted.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p336\">\n      <span class=\"num\">336</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To carry out those provisions, the 1875 meander line of section 8, of township 5 south, range 14 west, of the Indian meridian, in Oklahoma, was retraced and re-established, because that line forms the southerly line of patented or allotted tracts, which are within what is now the bed of the river, as such southerly line was represented by the official survey of the United States according to which those tracts were patented or allotted. The meander line of 1875 was retraced and re-established in conformity with the rules stated in the Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States, with markers located in true position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p337\">\n      <span class=\"num\">337</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The location of the medial line was then determined by running twenty-three cross-sections of the river, by accurate measurement from bank to bank to determine the exact mid-point positions. These mid-points were then connected by straight and curved lines in a manner designed to produce a true and connected medial line conforming to the directions and curves of the two banks, considered together. Markers were placed in the river bed to show and aid in retracing the line. A number of the markers are immediately on the medial line, but some are only near to it and are in the nature of witness posts, being connected up with the line by course and distance as shown in the field notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these markers are heavy iron pipe, called 'drill stem,' 4 inches in diameter, 20 feet long, driven through the sand into the hard clay and shale of the river bed, leaving 30 inches exposed. The material, outfit and crew for this work were furnished by the receiver in this suit. Bronze tablets were placed in the tops of the pipes, each tablet being marked as indicated upon the map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The map which forms a part of this report, is more specifically identified as Map No. 2 of the boundary survey, and is a cadastral map of the oil field region, in two sheets, Nos. 1 and 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All oil wells within 300 feet of the medial line have been accurately located and are shown in the field notes and upon the map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The field notes follow:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MEANDERS OF NORTH BANK.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p342\">\n      <span class=\"num\">342</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning at witness post No. 100, near the north point of the 'Big Bend,' as such post is described in the field notes of the boundary survey, and from which post a point on the south bank of the river bears N. 15x W., 16 ft. dist.; thence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p343\">\n      <span class=\"num\">343</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N. 11x00' W., on river cross-section, 2,157.5 ft. ft.

The south bank of the river is the waterwashed and      relatively permanent elevation or acclivity, commonly called      a cut bank, along the southerly side of the river which      separates its bed from the adjacent upland, whether valley or      hill, and usually serves to confine the waters within the bed      and to preserve the course of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'6. The boundary between the two states is on and along that      bank at the mean level attained by the waters of the river      when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'7. The exceptional places where there is no well defined cut      bank, but only a gradual incline from the sand bed of the      river to the upland, the boundary is a line over such incline      conforming to the mean level of the waters when at other      places in that vicinity they reach and wash the cut bank      without overflowing it.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing specifications applied in the light of the      opinion, admit of, and require the exercise of practical      judgment in determining the line intended; but certain      fundamentals, such as the following, obviously must form the      final basis for the exact location of the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boundary line is a gradient of the flowing water in the      river. It is located midway between the lower level of the      flowing water that just reaches the cut bank, and the higher      level of it that just does not overtop the cut bank. The      physical top of the cut bank being very uneven in profile,      cannot be a datum for locating the boundary line; but a      gradient along the bank must be used for that purpose. The highest point on this gradient      must not be higher than the lowest acceptable point on the      bank in that vicinity. The boundary line has been determined      accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have marked the boundary line by wooden posts called      'witness posts' set along the bank at varying short distances      from the boundary, and from each other. A bearing and      distance has been taken from each witness post to one or more      points on the boundary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Permanent reference monuments are located at varying      intervals on the Texas bluff overlooking the river valley.      Other permanent reference monuments are located on the      Oklahoma bluff, and these overlook the river valley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By accurate surveys the witness posts are joined to each      other and to the monuments on the Texas bluff. Similarly the      Texas monuments are joined to each other and to the Oklahoma      monuments, which in turn, are joined to each other and to the      witness posts. Permanent bench marks located near the      boundary are also joined to the witness posts and to the      reference monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All oil wells within three hundred feet of the boundary have      been accurately located upon the ground, and the position of      each, whether in Texas or in Oklahoma, is stated. From each      oil well, a bearing and distance is given to a point on the      boundary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boundary line is shown by the usual symbol and      appropriate wording on the accompanying maps, which also show      the positions of the witness posts, the oil wells, the      reference monuments, the bench marks and other information      usually appearing on such maps.

S. 505, 43 Sup. Ct. 701, 67 L. Ed. 1094), we have surveyed and run upon the ground and have delineated upon an appropriate map the medial line between the state boundary along the south bank of Red river and the northerly bank thereof for a distance of three miles in the vicinity of the river bed oil wells, and we beg to submit this joint report of that work, with field notes and map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p332\">\n      <span class=\"num\">332</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The survey was begun June 29, 1923, and completed February 17, 1924. The location of the medial line, as so established and delineated, conforms to the physical situation existing on December 31, 1923, the date as of which we ran, located and marked the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the reveivership oil area as shown and described in our report thereof filed contemporaneously with this report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p333\">\n      <span class=\"num\">333</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides locating the state boundary along the south bank as shown in the other report, a meander line of the north bank was run in the usual manner, for purposes of accurate platting and to aid in determining the location of the medial line. Temporary markers were placed at the angle points along the north bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p334\">\n      <span class=\"num\">334</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The establishment of the medial line conforms specifically to the provisions of the fifth paragraph of the decree of March 12, 1923 (261 U. S. 345, 43 Sup. Ct. 376, 67 L. Ed. 687), entitled 'Supplement to Partial Decree of June 5, 1922,' which paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p335\">\n      <span class=\"num\">335</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'5. In the sense intended herein, the medial line of the river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks, save that, under a stipulation between the parties affected, to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall be regarded and treated as falling no farther north than the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were patented or allotted.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p336\">\n      <span class=\"num\">336</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To carry out those provisions, the 1875 meander line of section 8, of township 5 south, range 14 west, of the Indian meridian, in Oklahoma, was retraced and re-established, because that line forms the southerly line of patented or allotted tracts, which are within what is now the bed of the river, as such southerly line was represented by the official survey of the United States according to which those tracts were patented or allotted. The meander line of 1875 was retraced and re-established in conformity with the rules stated in the Manual of Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States, with markers located in true position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p337\">\n      <span class=\"num\">337</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The location of the medial line was then determined by running twenty-three cross-sections of the river, by accurate measurement from bank to bank to determine the exact mid-point positions. These mid-points were then connected by straight and curved lines in a manner designed to produce a true and connected medial line conforming to the directions and curves of the two banks, considered together. Markers were placed in the river bed to show and aid in retracing the line. A number of the markers are immediately on the medial line, but some are only near to it and are in the nature of witness posts, being connected up with the line by course and distance as shown in the field notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p338\">\n      <span class=\"num\">338</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these markers are heavy iron pipe, called 'drill stem,' 4 inches in diameter, 20 feet long, driven through the sand into the hard clay and shale of the river bed, leaving 30 inches exposed. The material, outfit and crew for this work were furnished by the receiver in this suit. Bronze tablets were placed in the tops of the pipes, each tablet being marked as indicated upon the map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p339\">\n      <span class=\"num\">339</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The map which forms a part of this report, is more specifically identified as Map No. 2 of the boundary survey, and is a cadastral map of the oil field region, in two sheets, Nos. 1 and 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p340\">\n      <span class=\"num\">340</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All oil wells within 300 feet of the medial line have been accurately located and are shown in the field notes and upon the map.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The field notes follow:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p341\">\n      <span class=\"num\">341</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MEANDERS OF NORTH BANK.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p342\">\n      <span class=\"num\">342</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning at witness post No. 100, near the north point of the 'Big Bend,' as such post is described in the field notes of the boundary survey, and from which post a point on the south bank of the river bears N. 15x W., 16 ft. dist.; thence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p343\">\n      <span class=\"num\">343</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N. 11x00' W., on river cross-section, 2,157.5 ft. ft.
