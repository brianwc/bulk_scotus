In other words, the question of jurisdiction is alone before us for decision and, the letter of the complaint being regarded, there is no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Court, for the first subdivision of \u00a7 24 of the Judicial Code expressly gives the District Court jurisdiction of suits brought by the United States. This is such a suit. The United States is one of the plaintiffs and joined in the suit by way of asserting and seeking to enforce a right in which it claims to have a direct and legal interest. Judged by the complaint, the claim made by the United States is not frivolous or wholly without support but is real and substantial. In other words, it calls for consideration and determination.
