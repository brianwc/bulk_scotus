Upon habeas corpus proceedings in the federal court for the Southern district of New York it was held they were entitled to admission, irrespective of quota limitations, as the wife and child of a minister, who was already here, under section 2(d) of the Act of May 19, 1921, c. 8, 42 Stat. 5, as amended by Act May 11, 1922, c. 187, 42 Stat. 540 (Comp.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, &#167; 4289 1/4 b), in pari materia with section 2(d) of the Act of 1921. Section 3 of the earlier act enumerates various classes of aliens who are excluded from admission into the United States, among them all persons from certain Asiatic territory with specified exceptions. The Act of 1921, as amended. is an act to limit the number of aliens who may be admitted under the immigration laws to the United States. and is declared to be 'in addition to and not in substitution for the provisions of the immigration laws.' Section 4 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167; 4289 1/2 c). Section 2(d), among other things, provides that, when the maximum number of aliens of any nationality shall have been admitted, all others of such nationality applying during the same year shall be excluded, except as otherwise provided in the act. Following this, one of the provisos enumerates the aliens who are thus excepted, among them, ministers of any religious denomination. Another proviso is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That in the enforcement of this act preference shall be      given, so far as possible, to the wives, parents, brothers,      sisters, children under 18 years of age, and of fiancees (1)      of citizens of the United States; (2) of aliens now in the      United States who have applied for citizenship in the manner      provided by law; and (3) persons eligible to United States      citizenship who have served in the military or naval forces      of the United States,' etc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below, taking these various provisions together, held that under section 3 of the Act of 1917, these respondents were entitled to admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court was right in holding that the acts are in pari materia, and that section 3 of the earlier act is still fully operative and may be considered as though it formed a part of the later act. The question then is whether it includes aliens occupying the status of these respondents. The case, as the evidence shows, is one of peculiar and distressing hardship, and it is not unnatural that any appropriate canon of construction should be laid hold of to justify a conclusion favorable to the respondents. But if the plain words of the statute are against such a conclusion, leaving no room for construction, the courts have no choice but to follow it, without regard to the consequences. Fook v.

S. 460, 476, 32 Sup. Ct. 734, 56 L. Ed. 1165. Section 3 of the Act of 1917 defines and enumerates the classes of aliens who are to be excluded&#8212;idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, paupers, professional beggars, diseased persons, criminals, polygamists, anarchists, prostitutes, and numerous others, the last in the enumeration being natives of islands not possessed by the United States adjacent to the continent of Asia and of the continent within certain described limits of latitude and longitude.

The quota having been exhausted, no case was presented calling for the application of the proviso, even if the respondents could otherwise have been brought within its terms. The contention that it is absurd and unreasonable to say that the wives and children of ministers from the barred Asiatic zone are to be admitted and those outside of it denied admission, does not require consideration, since the result we have stated necessarily follows from the plain words of the law, for which we are not at liberty to substitute a rule based upon other notions of policy or justice.
