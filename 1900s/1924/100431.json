The latter is the contention of the railroad company although it rendered bills for and accepted payment of them upon the other view. Its explanation is: It believed that that view was correct; that is, believed the shipments were the property of the United States, and, so believing, rendered bills for $40,000 less than it was entitled to, and, so believing, accepted payment of them. For that $40,000 this action was brought. The Court of Claims decided against the railroad company and dismissed its petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no contest of the findings or of the decision of the Court of Claims, other than that expressed in the contention above stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears from the findings that the railroad company is a corporation and in the operation of a system of railways, those on which the shipments with which this case is concerned were transported.

To sustain this view, Clarkson v. Stevens, 106 U. S. 505, 1 Sup. Ct. 200, 27 L. Ed. 139, is cited. The case does not sustain the contention. It was decided that the intention of the parties was determinative, not an arbitrary rule of construction. In the case at bar the findings of the court demonstrate that the government especially intended to avail itself of the effect that the shipments were to be transported over land grant roads. and that it, the government, was entitled to deductions from the commercial rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The years of the shipments and the roads over which they were to be transported are given in finding V and the finding recites:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'These materials and supplies were all purchased on      invitation to bidders, proposals of bidders, and vouchers, on      which payments were made to the sellers.
