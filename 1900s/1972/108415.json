Thereafter petitioner reopened the case pursuant to &#167; 22 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 922. On the basis of testimony by the employee's personal physician and a commission-appointed doctor, petitioner concluded, contrary to his initial determination, that the disabling condition had in fact been 'materially aggravated and hastened' by the circumstances of employment, and awarded him compensation. The District Court sustained the award but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, one judge dissenting, reversed. 442 F.2d 508. The Court of Appeals held that in the absence of changed conditions or new evidence clearly demonstrating mistake in the initial determination, the 'statute simply does not confer authority upon the Deputy Commissioner to receive additional but cumulative evidence and change his mind.' 442 F.2d, at 513.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the wording of the statute nor its legislative history supports this 'narrowly technical and impractical construction.'
