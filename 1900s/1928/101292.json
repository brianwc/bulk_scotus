He was being hoisted up to paint the smoke stack; a rope broke; he fell to the deck and sustained serious injuries. The accident resulted from the negligence of the mate who selected a defective rope. An abundant supply of good rope was on board.</p>\n<p>Six months after the accident Plamals began this proceeding <i>in rem</i> against the ship in the District Court, Southern District of New York. The libel alleged that his injuries \"were due to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope was old, worn and not suitable for use, in that libellant was ordered to perform services not within the scope of his duties, and in other respects that libellant will point out on the trial of this action.\"</p>\n<p>There is nothing to show that painting the smoke stack was beyond the scope of the duties assumed.</p>\n<p>In the District Court the petitioner asserted by his proctor that he claimed under Sec. 33, Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, which follows \u0097</p>\n<p>\"That section 20 of such Act of March 4, 1915, be, and is, amended to read as follows:</p>\n<p>`Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\"</p>\n<p>The District Court ruled that the rights and liabilities of the parties were fixed by the law of the ship's flag and was of opinion that the British Workmen's Compensation Act afforded the only remedy. It accordingly dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that a lien against the vessel is essential to every proceeding <i>in rem</i> against her; and that no such lien arose by reason of Sec. 33 of the Jones Act in favor of the injured seaman. Upon that ground it affirmed the questioned decree.</p>\n<p>We agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals and find it unnecessary now to consider whether the provisions of Section 33 are applicable where a foreign seaman employed on a foreign ship suffers injuries while in American waters.</p>\n<p>The record does not support the suggestion that the \"Pinar Del Rio\" was unseaworthy.

They imposed personal liability and gave no lien of any kind. The statute which extended them to seamen expressly provided that the employer might be sued only in the district where he resides or has his principal office. This provision repels the suggestion that the intention was to subject the ship to <i>in rem</i> proceedings.
