Both vessels were seriously injured. The owners of the Svea libeled the Newport, her owners and master, in the District Court, Southern District of California. They charged that the collision resulted from the sole fault of the Newport and her navigators and asked for full damages. A cross-libel admitted fault, but claimed that the other vessel contributed and prayed for application of the half-damage rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court concluded that the collision resulted solely from the gross negligence and plain fault of the Newport and granted a decree against her and the master-McKinnon-for all established damages. The Circuit Court of Appeals held there was mutual fault, divided the damages, and definitely declared that under the approved rule the master was responsible for the negligence of subordinates without regard to his personal fault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for cross-petitioner McKinnon earnestly maintain that considering present conditions of navigation the master, when free from fault, ought not to be held liable for the action of others. But it is unnecessary now to discuss that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the record fails to disclose that the master met the exacting duties voluntarily assumed. An amazing casualty occurred while he commanded, and presumably, at least, he participated in the admitted fault of his ship.

The Newport was proceeding eastward at nine knots with the Svea off her starboard side steaming northward at eight knots. They were approaching each other upon crossing courses and in full view for more than half an hour. Twenty minutes before the collision Capt. McKinnon quit the bridge of the Newport, leaving the third officer in charge. Of this subordinate he testified: 'This young man was just keeping his first watch on ship; he just shipped the day before, and was making his first voyage.' When upon the witness stand the captain failed to show what, if any, directions he gave, or that he took reasonable precaution to insure proper navigation in circumstances of obvious danger. He gave no excuse, nor did he indicate any necessity for leaving the bridge.
