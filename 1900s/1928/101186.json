December 12, 1921, after the voyage</p>\n<p>began and while at Port Arthur, Texas, he was discharged without fault on his part and without his consent. He received before a Shipping Commissioner the wages earned and $80.00 more. The vessel returned to New Orleans May 19, 1922. Thereafter Adams instituted this proceeding in rem wherein he sought to recover as damages the stipulated wages from December 12, 1921, to May 19, 1922, plus $2.50 per day for subsistence. The trial court granted recovery for the amount of such wages ($414.50) less $80.00, with interest from May 19, 1922, 10 Fed.

The shipping contract calls upon the seaman to go to various places, sometimes far from home, and it may be, for instance as in this case was the actual fact, that he may be discharged in a port distant from that where he signed the articles, or where he can not immediately secure any other employment on board ship or elsewhere, and that in all fairness he should recover more than the amount due him for wages earned. Hence it might be deemed advisable to have this indefinite element made definite by a general law with reference to which the parties may conclusively be presumed to have contracted, and which therefore should be taken to be the law of the contract.

The provision that such sum may be recovered 'as if it were wages duly earned' permits the seaman to enforce payment by the special and summary methods provided for collecting his ordinary wages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Calvin v. Huntley (1901) 178 Mass. 29, 32, 59 N. E. 435, we think the Supreme Court of Massachusetts properly interpreted section 4527, and in respect of it rightly said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It speaks not of punishment, but of compensation; its object      is to protect the seaman from loss rather than to punish the      master for discharging him. The remedy is given to the seaman      alone, and its plain purpose is to furnish a clear and well      defined rule of damages as between him and the master for a      breach of contract in which the seaman and the master or      owner are the only persons interested. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Nor does the rule of damages seem unreasonable. The shipping      contract calls upon the seaman to go to various places,      sometimes far from home, and it may be, for instance as in      this case was the actual fact, that he may be discharged in a      port distant from that where he signed the articles, or where      he cannot immediately secure any other employment on board      ship or elsewhere, and that in all fairness he should recover      more than the amount due him for wages earned. Hence it might      be deemed advisable to have this indefinite element made      definite by a general law with reference to which the parties      may conclusively be presumed to have contracted, and which      therefore should be taken to be the law of the contract. The      object of the statute is not to punish but to provide a      reasonable rule of compensation for a breach of contract. We      think the statute not penal but remedial. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree of the District Court must be reversed.
