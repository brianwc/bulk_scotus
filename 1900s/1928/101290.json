St. &#167; 3115 1/2 aa, property of domestic corporations, seized during war with Germany cannot be treated as owned by enemy, so as to preclude recovery of compensation from United States for use thereof, because their entire capital stock belonged to German corporation.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, having power to direct forfeiture of all property beneficially owned by enemy subjects during war, could provide for seizure thereof, followed by such compensation as President might determine, as was done by Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USCA Appendix; Comp.

In cause No. 4 the claim is for the value of two tugboats, launch, barge, and coal hoister requisitioned and taken by the United States April 6, 1917, at the port of New York; and in No. 5 judgment is asked because of three barges, likewise taken on the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below evidently proceeded upon the view that the property of appellant corporations should be treated as owned by an enemy because their entire capital stock belonged to a German corporation. And as the property was seized during the war with Germany it held there could be no recovery. Without doubt Congress might have accepted and acted upon that theory. It was adopted in the St. Tudno, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 198, and the Michigan, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 421. But Congress did not do so; it definitely adopted the policy of disregarding stock ownership as a test of enemy character and permitted property of domestic corporations to be dealt with as nonenemy.
