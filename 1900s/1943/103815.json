They were indicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 76, the first branch of which includes two elements: impersonation of an officer of the government and acting as such with intent to defraud either the United States or any person.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Judge sustained a demurrer to the indictment, holding that the conduct of the defendants, \"while highly reprehensible, does not come within the terms of the statute.\"<sup>[2]</sup> He apparently concluded that the count of the indictment under consideration did not, within the meaning of the statute, make sufficient allegations either of impersonation or of acting with intent to defraud. Since the decision below was based on a construction of the statute, the case was properly brought here by the government under the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*704</span> Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 682, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 345.</p>\n<p>Government officials are impersonated by any persons who \"assume to act in the pretended character.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnow,</i> 239 U.S. 74, 77. The most general allegation of impersonation of a government official, therefore, sufficiently charges this element of the offense. The validity of this portion of the indictment was not contested here.</p>\n<p>We hold that the words \"intent to defraud,\" in the context of this statute, do not require more than that the defendants have, by artifice and deceit, sought to cause the deceived person to follow some course he would not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.<sup>[3]</sup> If the statutory language alone had been used, the indictment would have been proof against demurrer under <i>Lamar</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 241 U.S. 103, 116; <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 314 U.S. 306, 307; and this indictment has merely been made more elaborate than that in the <i>Lamar</i> case by the addition of a description of the nature of the alleged fraud. In any case, this branch of the statute covers the acquisition of information by impersonation although the information may be wholly valueless to its giver. This result is required by <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnow, supra,</i> 80, in which we held that the purpose of the statute was \"to maintain the general good repute and dignity of the [government] service itself,\" and cited with approval cases which, interpreting an analogous statute, said: \"it is not essential to charge or prove an actual financial or property loss to make a case under the statute.\" <i>Haas</i> v. <i>Henkel,</i> 216 U.S. 462, 480; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Plyler,</i> 222 U.S. 15.</p>\n<p>The first clause of this statute, the only one under consideration here, defines one offense; the second clause defines <span class=\"star-pagination\">*705</span> another. While more than mere deceitful attempt to affect the course of action of another is required under the second clause of the statute, which speaks of an intent to obtain a \"valuable thing,\" the very absence of these words of limitation in the first portion of the act persuades us that, under it, a person may be defrauded although he parts with something of no measurable value at all.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
