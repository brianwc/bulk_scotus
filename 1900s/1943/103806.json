The company had outstanding but two classes of stock: voting common, of a par value of $397,471.25; and non-voting common, of a par value of $819,333.06. The dividend was of non-voting common of a par of $121,680.43 and was distributed to holders of the voting and non-voting common. The fair market value of the stock distributed as a dividend was its par value, and the earnings or profits available for distribution were in excess of its total value. Neither the voting rights of the voting common, nor its right to share in dividends and in liquidation, was altered by the distribution.</p>\n<p>The respondent, who owned no non-voting common, received 200 shares of that class of stock. In his return for 1936, he did not report the dividend as income. The Commissioner determined a deficiency by including the value of the dividend as income, and the Board of Tax Appeals sustained him.<sup>[2]</sup> The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the dividend was not constitutionally the subject of income tax if it was distributed to holders of both classes of outstanding stock in proportion to their respective holdings. It accordingly remanded the case to the Board to find the facts and to apply the rule announced.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>No. 66</h2>\n<p>Petitioner owned 200 shares of common, \u0097 the entire stock of a corporation.

The directors voted a distribution to stockholders of $5,000 par of the preferred stock; and the petitioner, as sole stockholder, received fifty shares as a stock dividend.
