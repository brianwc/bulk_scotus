Paragraph 2(b) of the order directed that petitioner 'make whole' the employees by payment to them of a sum 'equal to that which they would normally have earned as wages' during the specified period, less their 'net earnings' during the period (34 N.L.R.B. 1, 21). On consent of the parties, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit enforced the other provisions of the Board's order, and reserved 'jurisdiction' to determine whether Paragraph 2(b) permitted petitioner to deduct benefits received by the employees under the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act, Ill.Rev.Stat.1941, c. 48, &#167;&#167; 217&#8212;250, and, if not, whether to that extent the order was within the power of the Board. On consideration of the questions reserved, the court construed the order as not permitting such a deduction, and held that so construed it was within the Board's authority. 129 F.2d 169. An appropriate enforcement decree was entered, and we granted certiorari. 317 U.S. 617, 63 S.Ct. 201, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the court below that the benefits received under the state compensation act were plainly not 'earnings' which, under the terms of the Board's order, could be deducted from the back pay awarded.

We do not find that, at any stage of the proceedings before the Board, the objection now urged as to the Board's lack of power was presented to it or to any member or agent of the Board, or that there are any 'extraordinary circumstances' which would excuse such failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 2(b) of the Board's order is in substance the recommendation of the intermediate report of the trial examiner.
