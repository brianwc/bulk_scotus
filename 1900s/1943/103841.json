JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has certified to us two questions of law pursuant to \u00a7 239 of the Judicial Code. The certificate shows that the three defendants were soldiers and were convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451, 457, in the federal District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, for the rape of a civilian woman. The alleged offense occurred within the confines of Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, a government military camp, on land to which the government had acquired title at the time of the crime. The ultimate question is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> whether the camp was, at the time of the crime, within the federal criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Act of October 9, 1940, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 255, passed prior to the acquisition of the land on which Camp Claiborne is located, provides that United States agencies and authorities may accept exclusive or partial jurisdiction over lands acquired by the United States by filing a notice with the Governor of the state in which the land is located or by taking other similar appropriate action. The Act provides further: \"Unless and until the United States has accepted jurisdiction over lands hereafter to be acquired as aforesaid, it shall be conclusively presumed that no such jurisdiction has been accepted.\" The government had not given notice of acceptance of jurisdiction at the time of the alleged offense.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The questions certified are as follows:</p>\n<p>\"1. Is the effect of the Act of Oct. 9, 1940, above quoted, to provide that, as to lands within a State thereafter acquired by the United States, no jurisdiction exists in the United States to enforce the criminal laws embraced in United States Code Title 18, Chapter 11, and especially Section 457 relating to rape, by virtue of Section 451, Third, as amended June 11, 1940, unless and until a consent to accept jurisdiction over such lands is filed in behalf of the United States as provided in said Act?</p>\n<p>\"2.
