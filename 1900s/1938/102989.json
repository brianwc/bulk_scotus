April 30, 1932, a check was mailed to the taxpayer for this erroneous refund.

Ordinarily, recovery of Government funds, paid by mistake to one having no just right to keep the funds, is not barred by the passage of time.<sup>[4]</sup> There is no contention here that respondent has any right to retain this refund erroneously paid by the Government. His defense is that the statutory bar prevents recovery. The Government's right to recover funds, from a person who received them by mistake and without right, is not barred unless Congress has \"clearly manifested its intention\"<sup>[5]</sup> to raise a statutory barrier.</p>\n<p>Section 610 \u0097 urged by respondent as a statutory barrier \u0097 requires that the Government bring suit \"before the expiration of two years <i>after the making of such</i> [<i>erroneous</i>] <i>refund</i>. . ..\" Respondent contends that the Revenue Act of 1932<sup>[6]</sup> indicated Congressional intent to designate the date of <i>allowance</i> of a refund (the date the Commissioner signs the schedule of over-assessments) as the date of refund for computing the period of limitations under \u00a7 610. The 1932 Act provides:</p>\n<p>\"Where the Commissioner has (before or after June 6, 1932) signed a schedule of overassessments in respect of any internal revenue tax imposed by [the Revenue Act of 1932] or any prior revenue Act, the date on which he first signs such schedule (if after May 28, 1928) shall be considered <i>as the date of allowance</i> of refund or credit in respect of such tax.\" This Act in no manner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> relates to limitations on suits for erroneous refunds.

Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to him. The construction urged by respondent would allow the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery on an erroneous payment before any such payment is made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a statute of limitations contained in a revenue act,<sup>[9]</sup> \"Logically the period of limitation should run from the date of payment, since it is at that time that the right accrues.\"</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that Congress did not intend the limitations of \u00a7 610 to run against the Government until the Government's right \"has accrued in a shape to be effectually enforced.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed.

'Congress may well be supposed to have used language in accordance with the common understanding.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d Ed., Unabridged, defines 'refund' as 'that which is refunded' and defines the transitive verb as: 'to return (money) in restitution, repayment * * *.' Only by ignoring the common understanding of words could 'making * * * (a) refund' be considered synonymous with 'allowing a refund.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Congress had in mind the separate and distinct meanings of these two expressions is clearly demonstrated in House Report No. 2, 70th Congress, 1st Session, pages 34, 35, containing the Committee Report on the Revenue Act of 1928:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The section (610) provides that any erroneous refund, * * * may be recovered by suit brought in the name of the United States if such suit is begun within two years after the making of the refund.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following, in referring to section 614, 26 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1671 and note the Report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The principal change made in existing law is that in the case of a refund the interest period now terminates with the allowance of the refund, a date which often precedes the actual making of the refund * * *.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's signature on a schedule of overassessments does not finally establish a claimant's right to a refund and does not preclude further investigation and consideration of the claim. The Commissioner could later take his signature from the schedule and as pointed out by this Court might&#8212;even after a check was signed and mailed&#8212;cancel the payment and revoke the authority of payment erroneously made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would require language so clear as to leave room for no other reasonable construction in order to induce the belief that Congress intended a statute of limitations to begin to run before the right barred by it has accrued. Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to him. The construction urged by respondent would allowed the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery on an erroneous payment before any such payment is made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a statute of limitations contained in a revenue act,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 'Logically the period of limitation should run from the date of payment, since it is at that time that the right accrues.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that Congress did not intend the limitations of section 610 to run against the Government until the Government's right 'has accrued in a shape to be effectually enforced.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed.
