The restraint was alleged to consist in provisions in license agreements which prevented any \"feature picture\" of the distributors, which had been shown \"first-run\" in a theater of the defendant exhibitor at an admission price of 40 cents or more. from thereafter being exhibited in the same locality at an admission price of less than 25 cents or on the same program with another feature picture.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> The evidence was presented by an agreed statement of certain facts and by oral testimony on behalf of each party. The District Court entered a final decree adjudging that in making the restrictive agreements the distributors had engaged in a conspiracy with the exhibitor, Interstate Circuit, Inc. and its officers, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act and granting a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the restrictions. 20 F. Supp. 868. The case comes here on direct appeal.

The court made no formal findings. The court did not find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law as the rule required. The statements in the decree that in making the restrictive agreements the parties had engaged in an illegal conspiracy were but ultimate conclusions and did not dispense with the necessity of properly formulating the underlying findings of fact.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the court was not a substitute for the required findings. A discussion of portions of the evidence and the court's reasoning in its opinion do not constitute the special and formal findings by which it is the duty of the court appropriately and specifically to determine all the issues which the case presents. This is an essential aid to the appellate court in reviewing an equity case (<i>Railroad Commission</i> v. <i>Maxcy,</i> 281 U.S. 82, and cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> cited) and compliance with the rule is particularly important in an anti-trust case which comes to this Court by direct appeal from the trial court.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that the distributors were parties to a common plan constituting a conspiracy in restraint of commerce; that each distributor would benefit by unanimous action, whereas otherwise the restrictions would probably injure the distributors who imposed them, and that prudence dictated that \"no distributor agree to impose the restrictions in the absence of agreement or understanding that his fellows would do likewise\"; that the restraints were unreasonable and that they had the purpose and effect of raising and maintaining the level of admission prices; that even if the distributors acted independently and not as participants in a joint undertaking, still the restraints were unreasonable in their effect upon the exhibitor's competitors.</p>\n<p>Appellants, asserting copyright privileges, contend that the restrictions were reasonable; that they were intended simply to protect the licensee from what would otherwise be an unreasonable interference by the distributors with the enjoyment of the granted right of exhibition; that there was no combination or conspiracy among the distributors; that it was to the independent advantage of each distributor to impose the restrictions in its own agreement and that the contention that less than substantially unanimous action would have injured the distributors in making such agreements was contrary to the evidence; and that the restrictions did not have an injurious effect.</p>\n<p>We intimate no opinion upon any of the questions raised by these rival contentions, but they point the importance of special and adequate findings in accordance with the prescribed equity practice.</p>\n<p>The decree of the District Court is set aside and the cause is remanded with directions to the court to state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> its findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Equity Rule 70 1/2.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
