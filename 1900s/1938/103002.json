As to substantial rights, Congress evidently meant to give claimants an identical status in both Courts where the amount in controversy was included in the jurisdiction of both. We find no support in the background or objective of the Act for a construction under which a claimant's rights would be preserved by filing a petition in the Court of Claims, but would be lost without additional action&#8212;in the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said by this Court in United States v. Greathouse, 166 U.S. 601, 606, 17 S.Ct. 701, 703, 41 L.Ed. 1130: 'It was not contemplated that the limitation upon suits against the government in the district * * * courts of the United States should be different from that applicable to like suits in the court of claims.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As used in this statute the word 'begun' should be given its ordinary and accustomed meaning. To begin is to start; to institute; to initiate; to commence. This suit was begun&#8212;within two years after the refund claim was disallowed&#8212;when the petion was filed in court in good faith. Notice was mailed the Attorney General and the District Attorney was promptly served&#8212;both within four days after the verified petition was filed. Under these circumstances, we do not consider what would be the effect of lack of diligence in obtaining service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The judgment in the court below was not in harmony with the views here expressed and is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 116, &#167; 1113.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Chapter 359, 24 Stat. 505, 506, &#167;&#167; 5, 6, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 762, 763.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> U.S.C., title 28, &#167; 41(20), 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 41(20), Judicial Code &#167; 24(20), as amended.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> D.C., 19 F.Supp. 526.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> 1 Cir., 93 F.2d 721.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 12 Stat. 765, 767, now Jud.Code &#167; 156, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 262.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Congressional Record and Appendix, 49th Cong., 2d Sess., March 3, p. 2679.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> House Report No. 1077, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., by Mr. Tucker on the Tucker Bill.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Congressional Record and Appendix, 49th Cong., 2d Sess., March 3, p. 2679.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> House Rep.
