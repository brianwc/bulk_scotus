'And if the Insured is totally and presumably permanently disabled before age 60, will pay to the Insured $400.00 monthly during such disability, increasing after five and ten years continuous disability, besides waiving premium payments, all upon the conditions set forth in Section 3.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy is a long and complicated document.

The provision for Disability Benefits shall automatically terminate if the Insured shall at any time, voluntarily or involuntarily engage in military or naval service in time of war outside of the continental limits of the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada.'

But the petitioner maintains that the words used in the policy before us are inadequate definitely to disclose a purpose so to do. And we think the point is well taken.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mutual Life Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Hurni Packing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100283\"><a href=\"/opinion/100283/mutual-ins-co-v-hurni-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 174, this Court said: \"The rule is settled that in case of ambiguity that construction of the policy will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured. The language employed is that of the company and it is consistent with both reason and justice that any fair doubt as to the meaning of its own words should be resolved against it.\" See <i>Royal Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95986\"><a href=\"/opinion/95986/royal-ins-co-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 162, 165; <i>Bergholm</i> v. <i>Peoria Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101843\"><a href=\"/opinion/101843/bergholm-v-peoria-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 492.</p>\n<p>Examination of the words relied upon to show an exception to the Incontestability clause of the policy discloses ample cause for doubt concerning their meaning. The arguments of counsel have emphasized the uncertainty. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals reached different conclusions, and elsewhere there is diversity of opinion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*440</span> The District Court accepted the view approved in <i>Ness</i> v. <i>Mutual Life Ins. Co.</i> (Fourth Circuit), 70 F. (2d) 59, and <i>Mutual Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Markowitz,</i> (Ninth Circuit), 78 F. (2d) 396, which presented for interpretation language identical with that now before us. The Circuit Court of Appeals followed its earlier opinion in <i>N.Y. Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Gatti,</i> (Oct. 6, 1936), where the company employed different language. Certain life companies undertake to make exceptions to the Incontestability clause by words more precise than those now under consideration, and opinions in cases arising upon their policies must be appraised accordingly.</p>\n<p>Without difficulty respondent could have expressed in plain words the exception for which it now contends. It has failed, we think, so to do. And applying the settled rule, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the resulting doubt.</p>\n<p>The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   \"Section 3.  Benefits in Event of Total and Permanent Disability before Age 60.\n</p>\n<p>\"Total Disability.  Disability shall be considered total when there is any impairment of mind or body which continuously renders it impossible for the Insured to follow a gainful occupation.</p>\n<p>\"Permanent Disability.  Total disability shall, during its continuance, be presumed to be permanent;</p>\n<p>\"(a) If such disability is the result of conditions which render it reasonably certain that such disability will continue during the remaining lifetime of the Insured; or,</p>\n<p>\"(b) If such disability has existed continuously for ninety days.</p>\n<p>\"When Benefits become Effective.  If, before attaining the age of sixty years and while no premium on this Policy is in default, the Insured shall furnish to the Company due proof that he is totally and permanently disabled, as defined above, the Company will grant the following benefits during the remaining lifetime of the Insured so long as such disability continues.</p>\n<p>\"Benefits.
