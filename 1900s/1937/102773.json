The purchase price was charged to their deposit account.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Rauch died June 2, 1932. Claiming a preference, respondent, her administrator, refused the receiver's offer of a general claim against the estate and brought suit. Upon a directed verdict the administrator obtained judgment as a preferred creditor. The court was of opinion \"that the assets of the bank were augmented when the bank received from its customer the price agreed upon for said bonds and, therefore, that the plaintiffs is entitled to participate in the distribution of the assets of the defendant bank as a preferred creditor.\" The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed with an opinion which states: \"With the District Judge, we think that the proceeds of these bonds augmented the assets of the bank. They certainly reduced its liability to others.\"</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains that the bank's assets were not increased through sale of the bonds; that nothing arose therefrom which is original or changed form can be traced into the hands of the receiver.</p>\n<p>Respondent submits that since the bank used the bonds in discharge of a liability it \"was thereby saved the use of its own funds for that purpose and the assets of the bank at the time of closing were therefore larger in amount than they otherwise would have been. A discharge of reduction of a liability produces a corresponding increase in assets. For every debit there must be a credit.\"</p>\n<p>Obviously, nothing of value was added to the bank's property.

Also, a mere showing that the bank wrongly used property of another in discharging its indebtedness does not suffice to establish a preferred claim against the receiver.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we must hold that the courts below were in error and reverse the challenged judgment.</p>\n<p>The applicable legal principles were much discussed in <i>Blakey</i> v. <i>Brinson,</i> 286 U.S. 254; <i>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry.
