JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, in 1909, purchased one hundred and thirty-seven acres of land near Joliet, Illinois, for $60,000.00. Thirty-seven acres were divided into plots and developed for cemetery purposes by grading, constructing drives, planting shrubbery, etc., at a cost of $35,000.00. Grave plots, varying in area from 150 to 1,500 square feet, were sold from time to time under contracts for perpetual care.</p>\n<p>Some 36,000 square feet were disposed of during the years 1909 to 1913 at prices ranging from 70.2 cents to 79.5 cents. The average between March 1, 1912, and March 1, 1913, was 76.6 cents. In the three years 1926, 1927, and 1928, 42,000 square feet were sold for $1.55 to $1.77. To determine the taxable gains realized from the latter sales it became necessary to ascertain the value of the lots as of March 1, 1913. The petitioner's return estimated this at 76.6 cents.

He affirmed familiarity with the property on March 1, 1913, prices then prevailing, and stated that the sales of 1912 and 1913 were in normal course without extra effort. Also that \"the purchase price was established by my visiting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> a good many cemeteries that I figured were practically of the same class as that cemetery and situated near cities of about the same population, and I established a price from the price they were selling at.\" Further that \"every grave and lot in the cemetery sold since its organization is under perpetual care, and when perpetual care is provided, it means keeping the roads and drives in proper repair, keeping the drainage system in proper repair, keeping the fences in repair, cutting the grass, pruning the trees, shrubs, and keeping it in good condition.\" \"We hope for a gradual increase in sales every year because, as a general rule, for every head of a family that is buried you secure four new families.

We are of opinion that the valuation for which petitioner contends is reasonable and should be allowed.
