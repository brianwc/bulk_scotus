Annuity payments are not now in controversy. Two questions are presented and both must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p>I. Under § 162, Revenue Act, 1928, 45 Stat. 838, copied in the margin, is it necessary that the will or deed creating a trust definitely direct the charitable contributions which are claimed as deductions?<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 23n of the 1928 Act which authorizes certain deductions for charitable contributions by individuals does not confine them to payments actually made from income, but does limit their amount to 15% of the net received during the year.<sup>[2]</sup> In lieu of these deductions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> § 162a permits trust estates to deduct charitable contributions to the full extent of gross income when made pursuant to the trust deed.</p>\n<p>We are asked to hold that the words \"pursuant to\" mean directed or definitely enjoined. And this notwithstanding the admission that Congress intended to encourage charitable contributions by relieving them from taxation. <i>Lederer</i> v. <i>Stockton,</i> 260 U.S. 3; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Provident Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102202\"><a href=\"/opinion/102202/united-states-v-provident-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 285.</p>\n<p>\"Pursuant to\" is defined as \"acting or done in consequence or in prosecution (of anything); hence, agreeable; conformable; following; according.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The words of the statute are plain and should be accorded their usual significance in the absence of some dominant reason to the contrary. We find nothing in the regulations or practice of the Treasury Department <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> or in the general purpose of the statute which requires the narrow meaning advocated by respondent. Neither the Commissioner nor the Board of Tax Appeals accepted or mentioned with favor the interpretation which his counsel now advance; and this is hardly compatible with the theory of controlling rulings or practice by the Bureau.</p>\n<p>The questioned donations were made by the petitioners in pursuance of the trust deed.</p>\n<p>II. In order that they may be allowed as deductions is it necessary affirmatively to show that charitable contributions by a trust estate were actually paid out of income received during the year in which they were made ?</p>\n<p>Section 23n limits deductible contributions to 15% of net income. Section 162a permits them to the full extent of gross income. This language should be construed with the view of carrying out the purpose of Congress  evidently the encouragement of donations by trust estates. There are no words limiting these to something actually paid from the year's income. And so to interpret the Act could seriously interfere with the beneficent purpose. One creating a trust might be unwilling to bind it absolutely to pay something to charity but would authorize his trustee so to do after considering then existing circumstances.</p>\n<p>Capital and income accounts in the conduct of the business of estates are well understood. Congress sought to encourage donations out of gross income, and we find no reason for saying that it intended to limit the exemption to sums which the trust could show were actually paid out of receipts during a particular tax year. The design was to forego some possible revenue in order to promote aid to charity. Here the trustee responded to an implied invitation and the estate ought not to be burdened in consequence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause returned there for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Revenue Act, 1928, § 162, 45 Stat. 838.\n</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 162. <i>Net Income.</i></p>\n<p>\"The net income of the estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner and on the same basis as in the case of an individual, except that </p>\n<p>\"(a) There shall be allowed as a deduction (in lieu of the deduction for charitable, etc., contributions authorized by section 23 (n)) any part of the gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the will or deed creating the trust, is during the taxable year paid or permanently set aside for the purposes and in the manner specified in section 23 (n), or is to be used exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, maintenance or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit; . . .
