The indictment was challenged because 'it fails to set forth that the defendant was under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurred and in the absence of this averment the indictment fails to set forth facts showing prima facie, a commission of the crime charged in the indictment.' The trial judge sustained the objection and quashed the indictment.
