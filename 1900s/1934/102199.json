It carried this to the Exchange's place of business in barrels or by tank trucks. Both sale and delivery were within the area long held and occupied by the United States for military purposes.</p>\n<p>The State demanded of appellant three cents per gallon upon the gasoline so sold and delivered. Payment being refused, this suit followed. In the trial court the Company prevailed. The Supreme Court held to the contrary and, among other things, said \u0097</p>\n<p>\"We thus have presented the question whether sales and deliveries of gasoline at a military reservation under the sole jurisdiction of the United States, made to the army post exchange therein, are to be excluded in fixing the license fees to be paid by the distributor under said act of the legislature. . . . It is at once conceded, as already implied, that the military reservation in question is territory over which the United States exercises sole legislative authority. . . . It is contended that, by reason of this concession, a sale consummated on it is a sale outside the state, as tho consummated in Nevada or Oregon.
