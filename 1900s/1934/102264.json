The plaintiff, McKnett, is a resident of Tennessee. The defendant, St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway Company, is a foreign corporation doing business in Alabama. It pleaded in abatement that the court lacked jurisdiction, since the cause of action had arisen wholly in Tennessee and did not arise by the common law or statute of that state. The plea rested upon the limiting words of the act of 1907, now embodied in section 5681, Code 1923, which declares: 'Whenever, either by common law or the statutes of another state, a cause of action, either upon contract, or in tort, has arisen in such other state against any person or corporation, such cause of action shall be enforceable in the courts of this state, in any county in which jurisdiction of the defendant can be legally obtained in the same manner in which jurisdiction could have been obtained if the cause of action had arisen in this state.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A demurrer to the plea was overruled; and the judgment entered thereon for the defendant was affirmed by the highest court of the State. 227 Ala. 349, 149 So. 822.

The denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is based solely upon the source of law sought to be enforced. The plaintiff is cast out because he is suing to enforce a federal act. A state may not discriminate against rights arising under federal laws.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   <i>Steen</i> v. <i>Swadley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></span>, 621; 28 So. 620. <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span>; 36 So. 720.
