He asked authority to proceed without bond or license; otherwise, he affirmed, final liquidation at material loss to all concerned would be necessary. The Attorney General, speaking for the state, objected.

Whatever may be the inherent power of a court incident to a grant of jurisdiction  <i>Michaelson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100475\"><a href=\"/opinion/100475/michaelson-v-united-states-ex-rel-chicago-st-p-m-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 66  there seems no ground whatever for saying that Congress cannot withhold or withdraw from courts of equity the right to empower receivers in conservation proceedings to disregard local statutes.</p>\n<p>The suggestion that to require petitioner to observe local laws would give the State inequitable priority over the United States as to taxes lacks merit. If any such result should follow it would accompany permissive action of Congress.</p>\n<p>And if the receiver cannot continue to carry on the Company's business according to the plain direction of Congress, he must pursue some other course permitted by law.</p>\n<p>The same statute which required receivers to observe the laws of the State, gave permission to sue them in state courts under stated circumstances. It was enacted more than forty years ago and seems to have been commonly regarded as within congressional authority.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> We are not dealing here with the acknowledged power of courts to protect property in their custody. <i>In re Tyler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93608\"><a href=\"/opinion/93608/in-re-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, and similar cases are not pertinent.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 102308, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/102308/", "sha1": "26d8f16d91523ad1b8ced941f7a66490387ebb0d", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:52:29"}
