The rights in the story under the copyright were assigned to Douglas. Thereafter Cunningham wrote for the Post Publishing Company, and the latter published in some 384,000 copies of a Sunday edition of the Boston Post, an article which was a clear appropriation of Douglas's story. Testimony was presented with respect to the value of the story, but at the close of the trial the petitioners admitted inability to prove actual damages. The Publishing Company acted innocently in accepting the article from Cunningham, and the latter testified that he had procured the material for it from an acquaintance, believed the facts related to him were actual happenings, and was ignorant of Douglas's production. The trial judge ruled that no actual damage had been shown, but in lieu thereof granted the petitioners $5,000 and a counsel fee.

In many cases plaintiffs, though proving infringement, were able to recover only nominal damages, in spite of the fact that preparation and trial of the case imposed substantial expense and inconvenience. The ineffectiveness of the remedy encouraged wilful and deliberate infringement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> This court has twice construed \u00a7 25 (b) in the light of its history and purpose. <i>Westermann Co.</i> v. <i>Dispatch Printing Co.,</i> 249 U.S. 100; <i>Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co.</i> v. <i>Buck,</i> 283 U.S. 202. As shown by those decisions, the purpose of the act is not doubtful. The trial judge may allow such damages as he deems to be just and may, in the case of an infringement such as is here shown, in his discretion, use as the measure of damages one dollar for each copy, \u0097 Congress declaring, however, that just damages, even for the circulation of a single copy, cannot be less than $250, and no matter how many copies are made, cannot be more than $5000. In the <i>Westermann</i> and <i>LaSalle</i> cases it was held that not less than $250 could be awarded for a single publication or performance. It follows that such an award, in the contemplation of the statute, is just. The question now presented is whether it can be unjust, according to the legislative standard, to use the prescribed measure, \u0097 $1 per copy, \u0097 up to the maximum permitted by the section. As the <i>Westermann</i> case shows, the law commits to the trier of facts, within the named limits, discretion to apply the measure furnished by the statute provided he awards no more than $5,000. He need not award $1 for each copy, but, if upon consideration of the circumstances he determines that he should do so, his action can not be said to be unjust. In other words, the employment of the statutory yardstick, within set limits, is committed solely to the court which hears the case, and this fact takes the matter out of the ordinary rule with respect to abuse of discretion. This construction is required by the language and the purpose of the statute. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, \u00a7 25, 35 Stat. 1081, as amended by Act of August 24, 1912, c. 356, 37 Stat. 489; U.S.C.
