CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner brought this action at law as beneficiary of several policies of insurance issued by respondent.

The action was brought in a state court in Pennsylvania and was removed to the federal court in February, 1933. Respondent's affidavit of defense set up as new matter that the insured had made false answers and declarations in his application with respect to a surgical operation he had undergone and to the treatment he had received by physicians and at hospitals; that the insured knew that these answers and declarations were false; and that they had been made by the insured \"fraudulently with the intent of deceiving the defendant into issuing to him the policies of insurance in litigation, when the facts were such that if he had answered said questions truthfully and had made a full and honest disclosure, the defendant would not have issued any of said policies, but would have declined his application.\" Respondent tendered judgment for the amount of the premiums received by it, with interest, and prayed that the policies be cancelled.
