Merchants' National Bank v. Detroit Trust Co. (1932) 258 Mich. 526&#8212;536, 537, 242 N.W. 739, 743, 85 A.L.R. 350. It held that one may purchase stolen negotiable bonds and acquire valid title as a holder in due course, although before the purchase, notice of the theft had come to him; but he may not willfully close his eyes to the notice, or resort to trick or artifice to avoid knowledge of its contents, or purposely forget it. He must act in good faith. Concerning Northwestern National Bank v. Madison &amp; Kedzie State Bank, supra, it said: 'As far as we have been able to determine, this case stands alone. It estops the purchaser from showing good faith at the time the bonds are acquired. It makes notice of theft conclusive evidence of mala fides. It overlooks the well-established rule that, though one has received actual notice, if by forgetfulness or negligence he does not have it in mind when he acquires the bonds, he may still be a good-faith purchaser. It has been said that the test is one of simple honesty and good faith.' It approved Lord v. Wilkinson, 56 Barb. (N.Y.) 593, which rejected an instruction that, 'The defendants once having had notice, are bound by it, although the notice may have been forgotten,' and declared: 'If the rule is well founded, that notice once given is good forever&#8212;that knowledge acquired when notice is given, is conclusive evidence of knowledge possessed when the notes were bought&#8212;then this charge is correct. But if the bona fides of the defendants must be judged of from their acts, purposes and knowledge as they existed upon the day of the purchase, then the notice served is only prima facie or presumptive evidence of mala fides, and may be rebutted by proof that the notice was lost, or its existence and contents forgotten.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine approved in Michigan should be accepted by the federal courts, in the absence of an authoritative ruling in the state whose laws apply.

But we cannot think that the ruling and action in the <i>Northwestern Bank</i> case amount to such a construction. That cause, decided by the Appellate Court, First Division, October, 1926, involved title to stolen bonds held by one claiming as a bona fide purchaser, after receipt of notice of the theft. The court there said: \"The notice having been received by the proper agent of the bank to receive, open and acknowledge its mail in the line of his duties, we think the bank is estopped from claiming that it did not have actual knowledge of the defect in the title to the bonds it subsequently received.\" The State Supreme Court denied an application for certiorari without more. The argument is that this amounted to approval of the construction placed upon the statute by the Appellate Court. The point is not well taken.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> <i>National Bank</i> v. <i>Uptown State Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></span>, (1934) construed the statute differently, and made no reference to the earlier case. We cannot know upon what ground certiorari was denied. The Illinois Supreme Court has declared that \"Whether one has notice of a certain fact is a question of fact and not of law\"; <i>Paine</i> v. <i>Sheridan Trust &amp; Savings Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></span>, 348; 174 N.E. 368; also that denial of certiorari does not import approval of the reasons assigned by the lower court. <i>People ex rel.

Stats. 1933, c. 37, par. 49.</p>\n<p>No authoritative construction of the negotiable instrument law of Illinois supports petitioner's position. And the court below rightly undertook to determine for itself the meaning and effect of the pertinent sections.</p>\n<p>As with other enactments, the negotiable instrument law must be interpreted in view of the intended end  here, the free circulation of negotiable paper  and the meaning attributed by the courts to the language employed.</p>\n<p>In a contest over title to stolen negotiable bonds, the Supreme Court of Michigan recently considered the Uniform Negotiable Instrument Law of that State. <i>Merchants National Bank</i> v. <i>Detroit Trust Co.</i> (1932), 258 Mich. 526-536, 537; 242 N.W. 739. It held that one may purchase stolen negotiable bonds and acquire valid title as a holder in due course, although before the purchase, notice of the theft had come to him; but he may not willfully close his eyes to the notice, or resort to trick or artifice to avoid knowledge of its contents, or purposely forget <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> it. He must act in good faith. Concerning <i>Northwestern National Bank</i> v. <i>Madison &amp; Kedzie State Bank, supra</i><i>,</i> it said:</p>\n<p>\"As far as we have been able to determine this case stands alone. It estops the purchaser from showing good faith at the time the bonds are acquired. It makes notice of theft conclusive evidence of <i>mala fides.</i> It overlooks the well-established rule that though one has received actual notice, if by forgetfulness or negligence he does not have it in mind when he acquires the bonds, he may still be a good-faith purchaser. It has been said that the test is one of simple honesty and good faith.\"</p>\n<p>It approved <i>Lord</i> v. <i>Wilkinson,</i> 56 Barb. (N.Y.) 593, which rejected an instruction that \"The defendants, once having had notice, are bound by it, although the notice may have been forgotten,\" and declared:</p>\n<p>\"If the rule is well founded, that notice once given is good forever  that knowledge acquired when notice is given, is conclusive evidence of knowledge possessed when the notes were bought  then this charge is correct. But if the <i>bona fides</i> of the defendants must be judged of from their acts, purposes and knowledge as they existed upon the day of the purchase, then the notice served is only <i>prima facie</i> or presumptive evidence of <i>mala fides,</i> and may be rebutted by proof that the notice was lost, or its existence and contents forgotten.\"</p>\n<p>The doctrine approved in Michigan should be accepted by the federal courts, in the absence of an authoritative ruling in the state whose laws apply. It accords with what this court said in <i>Goodman</i> v. <i>Simonds,</i> 20 How. 343-365, 366, 367; <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Lardner,</i> 2 Wall. 110; <i>Vermilye &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Adams Express Co.,</i> 21 Wall. 138-146; <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Railroad Co.,</i> 101 U.S. 557-564; and <i>King</i> v. <i>Doane,</i> 139 U.S. 166-173. Also with the view long enforced in England. <i>Raphael</i> v. <i>Bank of England</i> (1855), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> 33 Eng. Law and Eq. R., 276; <i>London Joint Stock Bank</i> v. <i>Simmons,</i> Appellate Cases 1892, 201, 219; <i>Venables</i> v. <i>Baring Bros. &amp; Co.</i> (1892), 3 Ch. Div. 527. Likewise with the conclusions of many state courts and writers of text books, as is pointed out in Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, 7th ed. (1933), §§ 885, <i>et seq.,</i> and the accompanying notes.</p>\n<p>The challenged judgment must be affirmed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 102486, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/102486/", "sha1": "59f6305a4699f1521a2973ce9044f31abcb8759d", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:53:21"}
