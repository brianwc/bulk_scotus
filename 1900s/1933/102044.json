The findings of fact are general, and no rulings of the court were excepted to `during the course of the trial,' which are relied on. Exceptions, following an order of judgment, to alleged rulings in a written opinion of the judge assigning reasons for ordering a judgment for either party, are not rulings in the course of the trial. . . . Each of the assignments of error in this case relates either to matters of fact or to conclusions of law embodied in the opinion.
