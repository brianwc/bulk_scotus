In      October, 1918, the P Company closed its books upon an accrual      basis and made no provision for any taxes arising out of the      contract. It was there held that the amount of taxes of the M      Company paid by the P Company was income to the M Company for      the year for which such payment was made.

It was carried into Regulation 33, promulgated January 2, 1918, as Article 102, reading as follows:</p>\n<p>\"ART. 102. Leased properties.  When a corporation shall have leased its property in consideration that the lessee shall pay in lieu of rental an amount equivalent to a certain rate of dividends on its capital stock or the interest on its outstanding indebtedness, together with taxes, insurance, or other fixed charges, such payments shall be considered rental payments and shall be returned by the lessor corporation as income, notwithstanding the fact that the dividends and interest are paid by the lessee direct to the stockholders and bondholders of the lessor. The lessee, in making these payments direct to the bondholders and the stockholders, does so as the agent of the lessor, and the latter is none the less liable to return the amounts thus paid as income and to pay any tax that may be due thereon.\"</p>\n<p>Article 102 of Regulations 33 has been substantially embodied in all subsequent regulations as Article 546, of Regulations 45, Article 547 of Regulations 62, 65 and 69, and Article 70 of Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Acts of 1918, 1921, 1924, 1926 and 1928, respectively.</p>\n<p>Article 109 of Regulations 45, promulgated January 28, 1921, reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Taxes paid by a tenant to or for a landlord for business property are additional rent and constitute a deductible item to the tenant and taxable income to the landlord, the amount of the tax being deductible by the latter.\"</p>\n<p>This provision is also found in Article 109 of Regulations 62, Article 110 of Regulations 65 and 69, and Article 130 of Regulations 74.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*736</span> In addition to the foregoing general provisions, a specific ruling on this question was published in May, 1920, as A.R.M., 16, C.B. 2, page 62. The facts in that case are stated by the Commissioner as follows:</p>\n<p>\"A contract was entered into in July, 1917, between the P Company and the M Company, whereby the latter agreed to sell certain goods on a cost-plus basis. It was provided that the P Company should pay Federal taxes assessed on the profits accrued from this contract to the M Company. Performance under the contract was made by the M Company during 1918. In October, 1918, the P Company closed its books upon an accrual basis and made no provision for any taxes arising out of the contract. It was there held that the amount of taxes of the M Company paid by the P Company was income to the M Company for the year for which such payment was made. This ruling was followed not only in the case in which rendered, but also as a precedent in all other similar cases.\"</p>\n<p>The Commissioner says that no single instance has been found where the Bureau has departed from this general practice of construing taxes paid under the present circumstances to be income to the taxpayer whose tax liability has been discharged in such a manner.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner says that it was the purpose of the instructions to establish a consistent policy, and that if they have not been followed in individual cases, it is due to an unauthorized departure from the Bureau's instructions. More than this, it should be added that neither before nor since 1923 has any algebraic formula been used by the Bureau in computing taxes.</p>\n<p>Not only, therefore, is the conclusion that the question must be answered \"Yes\" sustained by the practice of the Department under all of the Revenue Acts, but the cases cited in the <i>Old Colony</i> case require the same view.</p>\n</div>", "id": 101451, "judges": "Taft", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/101451/", "sha1": "ea6ef1f018229fd9453a49695d7704436290f755", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:48:48"}
