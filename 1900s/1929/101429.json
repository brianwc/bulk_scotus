Respondent was the last carrier, and presented bills based on tariff rates applicable for the transportation of private property. The charges have been paid less $475.17, withheld by the government on the ground that it is entitled to land grant deductions.

The terms of the obligation are to be sensibly and fairly read according to the words employed and not expanded or restricted by construction. When considering another question arising under a like provision in a land grant act, this court said: 'It might be very convenient for the government to have more rights than it has stipulated for; but we are on a question of construction, and on this question the usus loquendi is a far more valuable aid than the inquiry what might be desirable.'
