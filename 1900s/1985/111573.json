He was tried for the murder of one Dan Turner, a friend of the petitioner and his family.  There were no eyewitnesses to the crime.  The petitioner had gone into Turner's grocery store to buy some cigarettes.  The petitioner testified at trial that he grabbed Turner when the latter opened the cash register.

There was evidence that the petitioner was under considerable stress in the days preceding the murder.  The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was insane or, at minimum, lacked the requisite mental intent because of his retardation.
