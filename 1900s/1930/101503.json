A deduction is claimed by him, as in the other case, for exhaustion or obsolescence of the good will, under the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act of February 24, 1919) c. 18, &#167; 214(a)(8), 40 Stat. 1057, 1067, using the same words for individuals that are used in section 234 for corporations, and under the Revenue Act of 1921 (Act of November 23, 1921) c. 136, &#167; 214(a)(8), 42 Stat. 227, 240, using the same words again.

The petitioner regarded this whisky as a personal investment, but the whole business was his, and we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the whisky was clearly a part of the stock in trade, and therefore that he was not entitled to the more favorable rate allowed by the Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136, &#167; 206(a)(6), 42 Stat. 233, for taxes on capital gain, excluding stock in trade.
