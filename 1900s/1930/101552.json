Thereafter the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, purporting to proceed under authority of the Revenue Act of 1918, Title IV, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1097, demanded that her executors pay additional taxes reckoned upon the value of the property held under the above-described trust instrument. Having paid the required sum, the executors \u0097 petitioners here \u0097 asked that it be refunded. By order of February <span class=\"star-pagination\">*243</span> 20, 1924, the Commissioner denied their request. In support of this action he said \u0097</p>\n<p>\"This trust was included in decedent's gross estate on final audit and review on the ground that it was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.

The gift of the principal, therefore, could not take effect during the decedent's lifetime.
