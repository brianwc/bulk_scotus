C. B. Faris, a judge of the District Court, Eastern Division of the Eastern Judicial District of Missouri, and the other judges thereof, to prohibit him and them from asserting and exercising jurisdiction in a certain suit brought March 25, 1923, by Edward F Goltra against John W. Weeks, Secretary of War. and other officers of the United States, in which it was averred that a contract was made between the United States, represented by Maj. Gen. William M. Black, Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, as lessor and Goltra, as lessee, whereby the boats and barges (then under construction) by the United States were leased and chartered to Goltra for the period of five years from the date of delivery of the boats and barges to him, Goltra, upon the payment of certain periodical rentals and a compliance by Goltra with other terms and conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit by Goltra, the pleadings in which are detailed in the petition, was brought to determine his rights under the contract and a supplement to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract was preceded by negotiations between Goltra and representatives of the government, particularly with the War Department and the then Secretary of War, which included among other things the construction of a fleet of towboats and barges in the then emergency of war But after the signing of the Armistice when the emergency of war had ceased, other negotiations were had between Goltra and the War Department and the Secretary of War, and a lease was made, the contract above, whereby the boats and barges were leased to Goltra, by him to be operated on the Mississippi river and its tributaries as a common carrier, he to pay all operating expenses, to take out fire and marine insurance, and incur and discharge other obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, 1921, the supplement to the contract was entered into between Maj.

There was also a prayer for a temporary injunction against any act whatsoever looking to the cancellation and termination of the lease, or the retention of the boats and barges taken before the attempted cancellation of the contract. The prayer was, that upon final hearing, a decree be entered in favor of Goltra to determine his rights under the contract and to perpetually enjoin the defendants from interfering in any way with his rights thereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mandatory order was issued as prayed, and an order to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the order to show cause the Attorney General filed suggestions against the jurisdiction of the court, and subsequently the other defendants made returns to the order averring that the suit was in purpose and effect, one against the United States and its property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion was made in accordance with the representations.

It denies the character ascribed to Goltra's suit. It alleges that there is a right of possession of the boats and barges in Goltra, and that while his bill was in course of preparation the defendants in the suit were proceeding with a large force of men to take from him and remove from St. Louis the boats and barges that remained in his possession, and that the suit was not one against the Unites States, but against individual defendants who were proceeding in violation of law, and it is averred that there is an adequate remedy by appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer of Goltra to the petition is presented with elaborate detail of fact and argument. In foundation and essence it is the same as that of the District Court. The opinion of the court, which was oral, is attached to it.

The question of the remedy is, however, the more insistent. Does the case justify it? Prohibition is a remedy of exigency and in exclusion of other process of relief. It is directed against unwarranted assumptions of jurisdiction or excesses of it. In some cases there may be instant judgment that such is the situation and the writ granted. In other cases there may be doubt and the writ denied. Ex parte Muir, 254 U. S. 522, 534, 41 Sup. Ct. 185, 65 L. Ed. 383. And doubt in the instant case would seem to be justified, for two District Courts have decided that, under circumstances such as presented in this case, it does not involve or constitute a suit against the United States.
