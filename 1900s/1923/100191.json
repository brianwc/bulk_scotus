It is a petition for leave to intervene in the latter suit instituted (as we have seen) by Francis P. Garvan, then Alien Property Custodian, Miller subsequently succeeding him. That suit is here on appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, this suit is here on appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey, a constitutional question being, it is contended, involved. \"The District Court,\" the assertion is, \"months after peace had been declared, denied Wesche's petition to intervene, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> and awarded conveyance and delivery of what was admittedly his separate property, to the Custodian.\"</p>\n<p>In support of these contentions and their pertinency and control, counsel's comment is that the Custodian made two demands for the property, but \"that these demands were both made while the act forbade recourse by any claimant to any court to review any seizure thereunder by the Custodian, save the United States District Court for the district in which the claimant resided. The amendment permitting suit in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia was added only by the Act of July 11th, 1919.

And the unconstitutionality of the act as applied to his case is also urged, and that the defenses were available to him in the suit. The court therefore, is the contention, in denying his petition to intervene, committed error.</p>\n<p>The case, it will be observed, is identical in legal aspects with <i>Commercial Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Miller.</i> Here, as there, Wesche's interest is asserted in the property, here by himself, there by the Trust Company.
