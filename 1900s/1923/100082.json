St. &#167; 1215) to review sentences of fine and imprisonment on the ground that they were cases in which the constitutionality of the National Prohibition Act, under which the convictions were had, was drawn in question. In addition to the constitutionality of the Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305), the assignments of error raised many questions as to the admissions of evidence and the charge of the court. We held that, in view of our previous decision affirming the validity of the National Prohibition Act (National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350, 40 Sup. Ct. 486, 588, 64 L. Ed. 946), the plaintiffs in error were precluded from raising the question again and basing thereon a claim of jurisdiction for a writ of error under section 238, that the question made was therefore not substantial, but frivolous, and that the writ should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction on the authority of Sugarman v. United States, 249 U. S. 182, 184, 39 Sup. Ct. 191, 63 L. Ed. 550, and cases cited. Heitler et al. v. The United States, Per Curiam, 260 U. S. 703, 43 Sup. Ct. 163, 67 L.

We find that there is no constitutional question of sufficient substance to give us jurisdiction to consider these other errors. In other words, we find that, to have such alleged errors considered and reviewed, the writ of error herein should have issued out of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the proper circuit. Accordingly we hold that these several cases should be transferred to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit at the costs of the respective plaintiffs in error, that that court be thereupon possessed of the jurisdiction of the same and proceed to the determination of said writs of error as if such writs had issued out of such court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>260 U.S. 438 (1923)</b></center>\n<center><h1>HEITLER<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.<br>\nPERLMAN<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.<br>\nGREENBERG<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.<br>\nMcCANN<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.<br>\nQUINN<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES.</h1></center>\n<center>Nos. 185-189.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Motion to transfer submitted December 11, 1922.</center>\n<center>Decided January 2, 1923.</center>\nERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> <i>Mr. Weymouth Kirkland</i> and <i>Mr. Robert N.
