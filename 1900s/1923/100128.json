Did the court there acquire jurisdiction to enter judgment?</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Minnesota followed <i>Wold</i> v. <i>Minnesota Commercial Men's Association</i> (1917), 136 Minn. 380, wherein the opinion referred to <i>Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Spratley,</i> 172 U.S. 602, and <i>Commercial Mutual Accident Co.</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 213 U.S. 245, but did not cite <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co.,</i> 218 U.S. 573, or <i>Provident Savings Life Assurance Society</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 239 U.S. 103.</p>\n<p>Section 6519, subdivision 3, Montana Revised Code of Civil Procedure (1915) provides \u0097 \"Any corporation organized under the laws of the state of Montana, or doing business therein, may be served with summons by delivering a copy of the same to the president, secretary, treasurer, or other officer of the corporation, or to the agent designated by such corporation. . ..

The right to make further investigation is reserved; but there is no evidence to show anything has been done under this reservation in the present case. Losses are adjusted by the directors in Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>The Association accepted Robert J. Benn's application for health insurance, solicited and recommended by Harry K. Hartness, a member, November 6, 1908, and a further application for additional protection May 3, 1911. These were sent by mail from Kalispel, Montana, where both individuals resided. Notices were regularly mailed to Benn at his home address, and he paid dues and assessments in the ordinary course. It does not appear that there was anything <span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> unusual or irregular in the proofs of death or the report of attending physician. Without further investigation and upon unsolicited information received through the mail, the Association declined to pay.</p>\n<p>Respondent claims that the facts show petitioner was doing business in Montana and the insurance contract was made and payable there. And it is said this contention is supported by <i>Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Spratley, supra</i><i>,</i> and <i>Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> 197 U.S. 407.</p>\n<p>Considering all the circumstances, it seems sufficiently clear that the agreement incident to membership is a Minnesota contract, there made and to be performed.</p>\n<p>The Montana court was without jurisdiction unless petitioner by doing business in the State impliedly assented that process might be served upon the Secretary of State as its agent. \"If an insurance corporation of another State transacts business in Pennsylvania without complying with its provisions it will be deemed to have assented to any valid terms prescribed by that Commonwealth as a condition of its right to do business there; and it will be estopped to say that it had not done what it should have done in order that it might lawfully enter that Commonwealth and there exert its corporate powers.\" <i>Old Wayne Mutual Life Association</i> v. <i>McDonough,</i> 204 U.S. 8, 21.</p>\n<p>The circumstances chiefly relied on to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana are these: The insured was asked to send in his application, upon a form furnished by the Association, by Hartness, one of its members and a resident of Montana, who with other members had been requested to procure such applications. The form was filled and signed in Montana and then sent to Minneapolis with the requisite fee. It was accepted and certificate of membership mailed to the applicant. After customary notices from the Association, with which blank applications for new members were commonly enclosed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> the insured sent dues and assessments from his home in Montana to Minneapolis by mail and received receipts \u0097 all according to the usual method. Other members of the Association resided at Kalispel. The Association reserved the right to investigate all claims for sickness, accident or death.</p>\n<p>Considering what this Court held in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Ry. Co.,</i> 205 U.S. 531; <i>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>McKibbin,</i> 243 U.S. 264; <i>People's Tobacco Co.</i> v. <i>American Tobacco Co.,</i> 246 U.S. 79; and <i>Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Curtis Brown Co.,</i> 260 U.S. 516, we think it cannot be said that the Association was doing business in Montana merely because one or more members, without authority to obligate it, solicited new members. That is not enough \"to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the State or district where service is attempted.\" <i>People's Tobacco Co.</i> v. <i>American Tobacco Co., supra,</i> 87.</p>\n<p>It also seems sufficiently clear from <i>Allgeyer</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 165 U.S. 578; <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co., supra</i><i>,</i> and <i>Provident Savings Life Assurance Society</i> v. <i>Kentucky, supra</i><i>,</i> that an insurance corporation is not doing business within a State merely because it insures lives of persons living therein, mails notices addressed to beneficiaries at their homes and pays losses by checks from its home office. See also <i>Pembleton</i> v. <i>Illinois Commercial Men's Association,</i> 289 Ill. 99.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the record fails to disclose any evidence sufficient to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana within the proper meaning of those words, and that the court there lacked jurisdiction to award the challenged judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",

The form was filled and signed in Montana and then sent to Minneapolis with the requisite fee. It was accepted and certificate of membership mailed to the applicant. After customary notices from the association, with which blank applications for new members were commonly enclosed, the insured sent dues and assessments from his home in Montana to Minneapolis by mail and received receipts&#8212;all according to the usual method. Other members of the association resided at Kalispel. The association reserved the right to investigate all claims for sickness, accident or death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering what this court held in Green v.
