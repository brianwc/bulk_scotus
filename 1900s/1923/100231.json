Anything beyond this is `an abuse, because it is the usurpation of power which a single State cannot give.'\" <i>Farmers' and Mechanics' National Bank</i> v. <i>Dearing,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89142\"><a href=\"/opinion/89142/farmers-and-mechanics-nat-bank-v-dearing/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 33, 34.</p>\n<p>Congressional legislation in respect of national banks \"has in view the erection of a system extending throughout the country, and independent, so far as powers conferred are concerned, of state legislation which, if permitted to be applicable, might impose limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the States.\" <i>Easton</i> v. <i>Iowa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95779\"><a href=\"/opinion/95779/easton-v-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 229.</p>\n<p>Plainly, no State may prohibit national banks from accepting deposits or directly impair their efficiency in that regard. And we think, under circumstances like those here revealed, a State may not dissolve contracts of deposit even after twenty years and require national banks to pay to it the amounts then due; the settled principles stated above oppose such power.</p>\n<p>Does the statute conflict with the letter or general object and purposes of the legislation by Congress? Obviously, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> it attempts to qualify in an unusual way agreements between national banks and their customers long understood to arise when the former receive deposits under their plainly granted powers. If California may thus interfere other States may do likewise; and, instead of twenty years, varying limitations may be prescribed  three years perhaps, or five, or ten, or fifteen. We cannot conclude that Congress intended to permit such results. They seem incompatible with the purpose to establish a system of governmental agencies specifically empowered and expected freely to accept deposits from customers irrespective of domicile with the commonly consequent duties and liabilities. The depositors of a national bank often live in many different States and countries; and certainly it would not be an immaterial thing if the deposits of all were subject to seizure by the State where the bank happened to be located. The success of almost all commercial banks depends upon their ability to obtain loans from depositors, and these might well hesitate to subject their funds to possible confiscation.</p>\n<p>This Court has often pointed out the necessity for protecting federal agencies against interference by state legislation. The approved principle of <i>obsta principiis</i> should be adhered to. <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316; <i>Osborn</i> v. <i>United States Bank,</i> 9 Wheat. 738; <i>Farmers' and Mechanics' National Bank</i> v. <i>Dearing, supra</i><i>; </i><i>California</i> v. <i>Central Pacific R.R.
