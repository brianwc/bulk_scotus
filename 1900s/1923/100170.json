It buys its products in other states, ships them into Ohio, and receives at its place of business large quantities of them. It has contracts for them which it is bound to consummate, and which it cannot perform without great loss, except through its established business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the terms of the statute, oil intended for sale for illuminating purposes must be inspected in Ohio, and it designates the fees to be paid to the state inspector or his deputy, which are payable on demand and are made a lien upon the articles inspected; and there are provisions which safeguard the quality of the oil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quantities of petroleum products are increased year by year, and the revenue derived by the state will increase over and above the revenue derived in past years, if the enforcement of the act is permitted to continue, and the act is repugnant to article 1, section 10, clause 2, of the Constitution of the United States forbidding states from laying imposts without the consent of Congress upon interstate commerce, except such as may be absolutely necessary for the execution of inspection laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act violates section 8, article 1, giving to Congress the power to regulate commerce, and also violates certain provisions of the Constitution of Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court decided that 'the act, except as to the amount of fees charged for inspection' was 'in its essential details and even in nearly all of the language employed, a re-enactment of the law declared unconstitutional in Castle v. Mason, 91 Ohio St. 296.' Commenting on the latter case, the court said it found the earlier act did not differ materially from the law pronounced void in Foote v. Maryland, 232 U. S. 494, 34 Sup. Ct. 377, 58 L. Ed. 698, and that also held to be void in Red 'C' Oil Manufacturing Co. v. Board of Agriculture, 222 U. S. 380, 32 Sup. Ct. 152, 56 L.

Such cost by      necessary operation unduly burdens and obstructs the freedom      of interstate commerce, and, as such commerce cannot be      separated from the intrastate shipments, the whole tax is      void.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was of opinion that the other questions discussed by counsel were not necessary to consider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phipps, as an individual, was dismissed from the case, except as director of the department of commerce.

It is admitted that these conclusions depend upon an estimate of the evidence, and the District Court adjudged against them The court found that the fees colle ted from July 1, 1915, to June 30, 1920, amounted to $639,057.47; the disbursements to $321,188.68. The court further found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The collections when least were 63 per cent. greater than      the inspection costs,' and had 'so advanced from year to year      that the fees provided by the statute must be held to be      unreasonable and disproportionate to the service rendered,      and the act must be declared unconstitutional, as imposing a      direct burden upon interstate commerce, unless interstate      shipments under the provisions of the act are separable from      intrastate shipments and the fees collected for the      inspection of the former are equal or substantially equal to      the cost of inspecting shipments of that character. The      defendant's [appellant's] position is that the two classes of      shipments are thus separable, and the interstate shipments      have in fact been inspected at a loss to the state.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The position was held untenable by the court upon considerations and reasoning which we need not reproduce. It is enough to say we approve of them. It is contended by appellant that whatever defects may exist on the face of the act, may be and will be corrected in its administration, and whatever excess there may be in the fees collected will not be assigned to interstate commerce. There is quite a minute and detailed argument to show how this can be done.
