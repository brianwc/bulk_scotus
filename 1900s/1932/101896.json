The indictment contained thirty counts, each charging the unlawful deposit of \"a certain filthy letter and writing in a certain post office.\" Each set forth <i>verbatim</i> a separate letter. The letters contained much foul language; charged the addressees or persons associated with them with sexual immorality, and in some cases charged miscegenation and similar practices. They were coarse, vulgar, disgusting, indecent; and unquestionably filthy within the popular meaning of that term. On the ground that no letter was obscene, lewd or lascivious within the meaning given to those terms in <i>Swearingen</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 161 U.S. 446, the District Court sustained a demurrer and quashed the indictment.

This Court, being of opinion that those words should be given the meaning attributed to them at common law in prosecutions for criminal libel, directed that the judgment of conviction be reversed, because the language used was not \"calculated to corrupt and debauch the mind and morals of those into whose hands it might fall\" and induce sexual immorality. 161 U.S. at 451. The indictment here under review contains no reference to \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious.\" The charge is of depositing \"a certain filthy letter.\" It is brought under the amendment to \u00a7 3893 of the Revised Statutes made by \u00a7 211 of the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1088, 1129, which inserted the words, \"and every filthy.\" Now the clause reads \"every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy, book, . . . letter.\"</p>\n<p>The lower court failed to recognize that the amendment introduced, not merely a word, but a phrase. Disregarding the collocation of the words, it treated the amended clause as if it had read \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy;\" and then, applying the doctrine of <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> gave to \"filthy\" the meaning attributed in the <i>Swearingen</i> case to the words \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious.\" Thus, the court emptied the amendment of all meaning. We think that it is a more natural reading of the clause to hold that by the amendment Congress added a new class of unmailable matter, \u0097 the filthy.<sup>[2]</sup> The letters <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> here in question plainly relate to sexual matters.
