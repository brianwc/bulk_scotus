The Circuit Court of Appeals overruled errors assigned to the District Court's action and affirmed the judgment.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The assertion is that the warrant is void for failure to observe the statutory requirement that it state the \"particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> grounds or probable cause\" for issuance; and for the further reason that it is based on affidavits which do not \"set forth the facts tending to establish the grounds of the application or probable cause for believing that they exist.\"<sup>[3]</sup> We need not consider the alleged defect of the warrant, as we think the objection to the affidavits well taken, and the warrant consequently without lawful foundation.</p>\n<p>Two affidavits were made before the commissioner. One purported to state the facts; the other merely asserted a belief that the statements in the first were true, and is clearly insufficient. <i>Byars</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 273 U.S. 28.</p>\n<p>So far as material, the more detailed affidavit states that \"on or about October 14, 1931, he (affiant) went around and about the premises hereinafter described and saw persons haul cans, commonly used in handling whisky, and what appeared to be corn sugar up to and into the place and saw the same car or truck haul similar cans, apparently heavily loaded away from there and smelled odors and fumes of cooking mash coming from the place, and he says there is a still and whisky mash on the premises.\"</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the process issued officers seized a still, its appurtenances, and 350 gallons of whisky, and these were offered and admitted in evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p>Section 25 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act<sup>[4]</sup> provides: \"No search warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as such unless it is being used for the <i>unlawful sale</i> of intoxicating liquor, or unless it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> is in part used for some business purpose such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding house.\"</p>\n<p>The affidavit fails to state the place to be searched is not a private dwelling, and the record affirmatively shows it was. At most the deposition charges the manufacture of whisky? no averment of sale is made; indeed no facts are given from which sale, on or off the premises described, necessarily is to be inferred. The court below, however, held that the facts set forth warranted a belief that the dwelling was being used as headquarters for the merchandising of liquor. This was deemed a sufficient compliance with the statutory permission for search of a dwelling if \"used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor.\"</p>\n<p>The broad construction of the act by the Court of Appeals unduly narrows the guaranties of the Fourth Amendment, in consonance with which the statute was passed. Those guaranties are to be liberally construed to prevent impairment of the protection extended. <i>Boyd</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 116 U.S. 616, 635; <i>Gouled</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 255 U.S. 298, 304; <i>Go-Bart Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 282 U.S. 344, 357.
