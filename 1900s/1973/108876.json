The judgment of federal courts as to the vagueness or not of a state statute must be made in the light of prior state constructions of the statute. For the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation 'we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it.' Minnesota ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court, 309 U.S. 507, 514, 68 S.Ct. 665, 669, 92 L.Ed. 744 (1940). When a state statute has been construed to forbid identifiable conduct so that 'interpretation by (the state court) puts these words in the statute as definitely as if it had been so amended by the legislature,' claims of impermissible vagueness must be judged in that light. Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 514, 68 S.Ct. 665, 669, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948). This has been the normal view in this Court. Fox v.

The Court of Appeals, therefore, was not free to ignore Delaney and related cases; and as construed by those cases, &#167; 800.01 afforded appellees ample notice that their conduct was forbidden by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees rely on Franklin v.

In that case, decided after appellees' convictions had become final, the Florida Supreme Court reconsidered Delaney and held that if &#167; 800.01 was intended to reach oral and anal sexual activity, that intention should appear on the face of the statute; otherwise it was void for vagueness and uncertainty in its language. But this holding did not remove the fact that when appellees committed the acts with which they were changed, they were on clear notice that their conduct was criminal under the statute as then construed. Thus, the Florida Supreme Court expressly ruled in Franklin that 'this judgment holding the felony statute void is not retroactive, but prospective only,' id., 257 So.2d, at 24; and subsequently the Florida courts denied appellee Stone's request for relief based on the Franklin case. Stone v. State, supra, n. 2. The State Supreme Court did not overrule Delaney with respect to pre-Franklin convictions. Nor was it constitutionally compelled to do so or to make retroactive its new construction of the Florida statute: 'A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backword.
