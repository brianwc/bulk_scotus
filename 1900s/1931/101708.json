There was no invention in a combination consisting of a covered rail track, conveyor car and an arm projecting over the course and connected with a mechanical lure carried before racing dogs. The patent could be sustained only by virtue of the distinctive feature of the arm employed. This was described in claim 1 as \"an arm extending through the longitudinal opening of the casing in a projecting position over the track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end thereof,\" and, in claim 2, as \"a horizontally extending arm hinged to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably mounted near the end of said arm, and resting upon the ground, a platform supported by said arm and a lure or quarry mounted upon said platform for attracting the dogs.\" The Court reached the conclusion that a rigid, horizontal arm, without hinge or wheel, was not the subject of either claim.
