JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>During the year 1922, while respondent Slayton engaged in the business of buying, carrying and selling tax-exempt municipal bonds, he collected $65,720.06 as interest on securities of that character which he owned. He paid out $78,153.84 for interest on money borrowed by himself in due course for the purpose of purchasing and carrying exempt securities. In his return showing income received during that year he excluded the interest so collected; and he claimed deduction for the interest paid out on the borrowed money. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and made a corresponding additional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*518</span> assessment. Respondent paid the sum demanded thereunder and, after proper preliminary action, sued to recover it.</p>\n<p>Determination of the question involved must turn upon the validity, construction and effect of Sections 213 and 214, Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 237, 238, 239.

Also that the act is discriminatory and unconstitutional in that necessary expenses incident to all other kinds of business, including interest paid for purchasing and carrying merchandise and inventories, are allowed as part of the operating cost, whereas deduction of interest paid by plaintiff upon funds borrowed to carry non-taxable securities (an ordinary operating expense) is prohibited. Also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*519</span> that the act is arbitrary and unconstitutional because it discriminates against plaintiff, whose resources do not permit him to purchase tax-free securities for cash, and in favor of those whose resources permit them to purchase and carry such securities without borrowing.</p>\n<p>The Collector unsuccessfully demurred to the petition upon the ground that it states no cause of action. Judgment went for the plaintiff and was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both courts were of opinion that, under the doctrine announced in <i>National Life Ins.

While guaranteed exemptions must be strictly observed, this obligation is not inconsistent with reasonable classification designed to subject all to the payment of their just share of a burden fairly imposed.</p>\n<p>The manifest purpose of the exception in paragraph 2, \u00a7 214 (a), was to prevent the escape from taxation of income properly subject thereto by the purchase of exempt securities with borrowed money.</p>\n<p>Under the theory of the respondent, \"A,\" with an income of $10,000 arising from non-exempt securities, by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*520</span> the simple expedient of purchasing exempt ones with borrowed funds and paying $10,000 interest thereon, would escape all taxation upon receipts from both sources.
