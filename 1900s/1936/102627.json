Issue was joined, and a special master took evidence, heard counsel for the States, made findings of fact, stated his conclusions of law and recommended a form of decree. The parties filed exceptions to his report and, after hearing counsel, the court May 20, 1935, decided (295 U.S. 455, 462):</p>\n<p>\"The decree to be entered in this case will establish the boundary through and along, or near, the middle of the waters of Green bay that are here involved.
