Wilson, in 1913, were altered with the intention of creating three separate trusts. The Board of Tax Appeals, upon findings supported by evidence, concluded that this purpose was accomplished and hence that there was no deficiency. McIllvaine v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 29 B.T.A. 304. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Board. Helvering, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McIivaine, 78 F.(2d) 787.
