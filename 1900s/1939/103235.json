Since a tax on payrolls, or on the relationship of employment, is not \u0097 but in fact is distinct from \u0097 the type of tax \"on\" articles represented by sales taxes and processing taxes, respondent is not entitled to the additional compensation which it seeks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> In view of our determination that the federal Social Security tax was not contemplated by the contract, we need not discuss respondent's contention that the tax paid under the Maryland Unemployment Compensation Act was a tax \"imposed . . . by . . .
