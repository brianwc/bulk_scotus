Also: Intoxicating liquors are legitimate articles of interstate commerce unless Federal law has declared otherwise. Interstate commerce includes both importation of property within a state and exportation therefrom. Prior to the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, and the Twenty-first Amendment, the powers of the states over intoxicants in both of these movements were limited by the Commerce, Clause. These enactments relate to importations only. Exports remain, as always, subject to that clause. 'Although a state may prohibit the manufacture of liquor, if a state permits distillation, sale and transportation&#8212;as Kentucky does&#8212;the rule of law is that the state may not annex to its consent to manufacture and sell the unconstitutional ban upon carriage of interstate exports of liquors by contract carriers.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below rejected appellant's insistence and affirmed the asserted power of the state. Like conclusions were approved in Commonwealth v. One Dodge Motor Truck, 326 Pa. 120, 191 A. 590, 110 A.L.R. 919; Id., 123 Pa.Super. 311, 187 A. 461; Clark et al. v. State ex rel.

Without doubt a state may absolutely prohibit the manufacture of intoxicants, their transportation, sale, or possession, irrespective of when or where produced or obtained, or the use to which they are to be put. Further, she may adopt measures reasonably appropriate to effectuate these inhibitions and exercise full police authority in respect of them. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry.

Former opinions here make an affirmative answer imperative. The greater power includes the less. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. North Carolina, supra. The state may protect her people against evil incident to intoxicants, Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 8 S.Ct. 273, 31 L.Ed. 205; Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 9 S.Ct. 6, 32 L.Ed. 346; and may exercise large discretion as to means employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kentucky has seen fit to permit manufacture of whiskey only upon condition that it be sold to an indicated class of customers and transported in definitely specified ways. These conditions are not unreasonable and are clearly appropriate for effectuating the policy of limiting traffic in order to minimize well known evils, and secure payment of revenue. The statute declares whiskey removed from permitted channels contraband subject to immediate seizure. This is within the police power of the state; and property so circumstanced cannot be regarded as a proper article of commerce. Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U.S. 52, 59, 35 S.Ct. 501, 502, 59 L.Ed. 835; Clason v.

Pearson, supra: An Act of the Iowa Legislature in general terms forbade manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor but permitted these for mechanical or other purposes. An injunction was approved which restrained Kidd from operating his distillery although he claimed the output would be exported for sale beyond the state. This Court said (128 U.S. 1, 9 S.Ct. 11, 32 L.Ed. 346): 'Whether a state, in the exercise of its undisputed power of local administration, can enact a statute prohibiting within its limits the manufacture of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, is not any longer an open question before this court. * * * The police power of a state is as broad and plenary as its taxing power, and property within the state is subject to the operations of the former so long as it is within the regulating restrictions of the latter.' The doctrine of that case has been often applied. Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519, 16 S.Ct. 600, 40 L.Ed. 793; Rippey v. Texas, 193 U.S. 504, 509, 24 S.Ct. 516, 517, 48 L.Ed. 767; Hudson Water Co. v.

To this end manufacture, sale, transportation, and possession are permitted only under carefully prescribed conditions and subject to constant control by the State. Every phase of the traffic is declared illegal unless definitely allowed. The property becomes contraband upon failure to observe the statutory requirements and whenever found in unauthorized possession.</p>\n<p>Section 52 provides  \"It shall be a criminal offense for any person to manufacture, store, sell, purchase, transport or otherwise in any manner traffic in alcoholic beverages as that term is defined in this Act, without first having paid to the Department of Revenue at its office in Frankfort, the license tax required by this Act, and without first having obtained the license required by this Act.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 53 declares to be contraband: \"(2) Any spirituous, vinous or malt liquors in the possession of any one not entitled to possession of the same under the provisions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> of this Act.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Peace officers are authorized to seize such contraband and institute proceedings for forfeiture.</p>\n<p>Licenses are authorized (§ 18(1)-(9))<sup>[5]</sup> for distillers, rectifiers, vintners, wholesalers, retailers, and (§ 18(7))<sup>[6]</sup> for the transportation of liquors to and from any point in the State.

Also: Intoxicating liquors are legitimate articles of interstate commerce unless federal law has declared otherwise. Interstate commerce includes both importation of property within a State and exportation therefrom. Prior to the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, and the Twenty-first Amendment, the powers of the States over intoxicants in both of these movements were limited by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> Commerce Clause. These enactments relate to importations only. Exports remain, as always, subject to that clause. \"Although a state may prohibit the manufacture of liquor, if a state permits distillation, sale and transportation  as Kentucky does  the rule of law is that the state may not annex to its consent to manufacture and sell the unconstitutional ban upon carriage of interstate exports of liquors by contract carriers.\"</p>\n<p>The court below rejected appellant's insistence and affirmed the asserted power of the State. Like conclusions were approved in <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>One Dodge Motor Truck,</i> 326 Pa. 120; 191 A. 590 (123 Pa. Superior Ct. 311; 187 A. 461); <i>Clark</i> v. <i>State ex rel.

Without doubt a State may absolutely prohibit the manufacture of intoxicants, their transportation, sale, or possession, irrespective of when or where produced or obtained, or the use to which they are to be put. Further, she may adopt measures reasonably appropriate to effectuate these inhibitions and exercise full police authority in respect of them. <i>Clark Distilling Co.</i> v. <i>Western Maryland Ry.

Former opinions here make an affirmative answer imperative. The greater power includes the less. <i>Seaboard Air Line Ry.</i> v. <i>North Carolina, supra</i><i>.</i> The State may protect her people <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> against evil incident to intoxicants, <i>Mugler</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 123 U.S. 623; <i>Kidd</i> v. <i>Pearson,</i> 128 U.S. 1; and may exercise large discretion as to means employed.</p>\n<p>Kentucky has seen fit to permit manufacture of whiskey only upon condition that it be sold to an indicated class of customers and transported in definitely specified ways. These conditions are not unreasonable and are clearly appropriate for effectuating the policy of limiting traffic in order to minimize well-known evils, and secure payment of revenue. The statute declares whiskey removed from permitted channels contraband subject to immediate seizure. This is within the police power of the State; and property so circumstanced cannot be regarded as a proper article of commerce. <i>Sligh</i> v. <i>Kirkwood,</i> 237 U.S. 52, 59; <i>Clason</i> v. <i>Indiana,</i> 306 U.S. 439.</p>\n<p>In effect we are asked by injunction to allow a distiller to do what the statute prohibits  deliver to an unauthorized carrier. Also to enable a carrier to do what it is prohibited from doing  receive and transport within the State.</p>\n<p><i>Kidd</i> v. <i>Pearson, supra</i><i>:</i> An Act of the Iowa Legislature in general terms forbade manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor but permitted these for mechanical or other purposes. An injunction was approved which restrained Kidd from operating his distillery although he claimed the output would be exported for sale beyond the State. This Court said: \"Whether a State, in the exercise of its undisputed power of local administration, can enact a statute prohibiting within its limits the manufacture of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, is not any longer an open question before this court. . . . The police power of a State is as broad and plenary as its taxing power; and property within the State is subject to the operations of the former so long as it is within the regulating restrictions of the latter.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> The doctrine of that case has been often applied. <i>Geer</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 161 U.S. 519; <i>Rippey</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 193 U.S. 504, 509; <i>Hudson County Water Co.</i> v. <i>McCarter,</i> 209 U.S. 349, 357: \"A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States. Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end\"; <i>Sligh</i> v. <i>Kirkwood,</i> 237 U.S. 52; <i>State Board</i> v. <i>Young's Market Co.,</i> 299 U.S. 59, 63; <i>Clason</i> v. <i>Indiana,</i> 306 U.S. 439.</p>\n<p>The two cases last cited recognize that the State may decline to consider certain noxious things legitimate articles of commerce, and inhibit their transportation. Property rights in intoxicants depend on state laws and cease if the liquor becomes contraband.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept appellant's contention that because whiskey is intended for transportation beyond the state lines the distiller may disregard the inhibitions of the statute by delivery to one not authorized to receive; that the carrier may set at naught inhibitions and transport contraband with impunity.</p>\n<p>The point suggested in respect of Due Process is not in accord with what has been decided in the cases above referred to.</p>\n<p>The record shows no violation of Equal Protection. A licensed Common Carrier is under stricter control than an ordinary contract carrier and may be entrusted with privileges forbidden to the latter.</p>\n<p>Here the state law creates no discrimination against interstate commerce. It is subjected to the same regulations as those applicable to intrastate commerce.</p>\n<p>The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 is said to secure to appellant the right claimed, but we can find nothing there which undertakes to destroy state power to protect her people against the evils of intoxicants or to sanction the receipt and conveyance of articles declared contraband. The Act has no such purpose or effect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> The power of a State to regulate her internal affairs notwithstanding the consequent effect upon interstate commerce was much discussed in <i>South Carolina Hwy.
