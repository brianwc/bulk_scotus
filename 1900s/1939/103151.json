It was later agreed \"that the temporary restraining order should remain in effect until final decision on the merits of the relief asked in the plaintiffs' bill of complaint and that hearing on plaintiffs' application for a temporary and permanent injunction should be consolidated.\"</p>\n<p>Defendants, Public Service Commission of Missouri and several state officers, in their answer included a counterclaim of the Public Service Commission seeking an accounting from plaintiffs for fees due to the State under the above mentioned Act for the use of the public highways during the time that the temporary restraining order was in effect. Upon stipulation, the restraining order was modified so as to provide for deposit of license fees with a trustee pending the termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p>On hearing, the District Court entered its final decree as follows:</p>\n<p>\"1.

That the relief prayed for in plaintiffs' bill of complaint should be and is hereby in all respects denied, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*206</span> plaintiffs' bill of complaint is hereby dismissed on its merits;</p>\n<p>\"3.

That defendants recover their costs and disbursements herein, to be taxed as provided by law and inserted herein in the sum of . . . . . . . .
