He pleaded guilty to charges of forging and uttering United States Treasury checks. He was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years on each count, to run concurrently, and the judgment provided that sentence should 'begin to run at the expiration of the sentence now being served in the Missouri State Penitentiary.' Petitioner was returned to the Missouri authorities to resume the service of a state sentence of three years for automobile theft. On May 13, 1947, before expiration of such period, he was paroled by the State and delivered to the federal authorities, by whom he has since been held. He contends that the federal sentence does not begin until the full term of the State sentence has expired and that, for the period of parole, he is entitled to freedom. The issue as to whether such wording of a federal sentence entitles the prisoner under such circumstances to temporary freedom is one on which Circuit Courts of Appeals are in conflict. Compare United States ex rel. Lombardo v. c Donnell, 7 Cir., 153 F.2d 919; Johnston v. Wright, 9 Cir., 137 F.2d 914; Kirk v. Squier, 9 Cir., 150 F.2d 3; Martin v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 165 F.2d 215.
