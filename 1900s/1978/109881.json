With him on the briefs were <i>Nancy Stearns, Jack Greenberg,</i> and <i>Eric Schnapper.</i></p>\n<p><i>L. Kevin Sheridan</i> argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was <i>W. Bernard Richland.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 in July 1971.<sup>[1]</sup> The gravamen of the complaint was that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*661</span> Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.<sup>[2]</sup> Cf. <i>Cleveland Board of Education</i> v. <i>LaFleur,</i> 414 U. S. 632 (1974). The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave. Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor. In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job. 394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975). No one now challenges this conclusion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*662</span> The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <i>LaFleur, supra.</i> 394 F. Supp., at 855. Nonetheless plaintiffs' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to \"circumven[t]\" the immunity conferred on municipalities by <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961). See 394 F. Supp., at 855.</p>\n<p>On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education<sup>[4]</sup> was not a \"municipality\" within the meaning of <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape, supra</i><i>,</i> and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions. The court first held that the Board of Education was not a \"person\" under \u00a7 1983 because \"it performs a vital governmental function . . ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent . . ., it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.\" 532 F. 2d 259, 263 (1976). The individual defendants, however, were \"persons\" under \u00a7 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities. 532 F. 2d, at 264. Yet, because a damages award would \"have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i>\" a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed. <i>Id.,</i> at 265.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071, to consider</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are `persons' within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?\" Pet. for Cert. 8. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*663</span> Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under \u00a7 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board<sup>[5]</sup>\u0097and, indeed, in some of which \u00a7 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343, provided the only basis for jurisdiction<sup>[6]</sup>\u0097we indicated in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Education</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided \"another day.\" That other day has come and we now overrule <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape, supra</i><i>,</i> insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under \u00a7 1983.<sup>[7]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> we held that \"Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [\u00a7 1983].\" 365 U. S., at 187. The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress' rejection of the \"Sherman amendment\" to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor of \u00a7 1983. The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by <i>private</i> persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe). Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend \u00a7 1 of the Act, which is now \u00a7 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by \u00a7 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <i>Monroe</i> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of \u00a7 1 because \"`the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any <i>obligation</i> upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.'\" 365 U. S., at 190 (emphasis added), quoting Globe 804 (Rep. Poland). This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its \"constitutional power . . . to impose <i>civil liability</i> on municipalities,\" 365 U. S., at 190 (emphasis added), and that such doubt would have extended to any type of civil liability.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <i>Monroe</i> incorrectly equated the \"obligation\" of which Representative Poland spoke with \"civil liability.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. An Overview</h2>\n<p>There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871. On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill \"to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.\" H. R. 320 contained four sections. Section 1, now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.<sup>[10]</sup> Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the \"other purpose\" of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.<sup>[11]</sup> The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections\u0097not \u00a7 1, now \u00a7 1983\u0097were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended. The House finished its initial debates on H. R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.<sup>[12]</sup> Again, debate on \u00a7 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*666</span> Immediately prior to the vote on H. R. 320 in the Senate, Senator Sherman introduced his amendment.<sup>[13]</sup> This was <i>not</i> an amendment to \u00a7 1 of the bill, but was to be added as \u00a7 7 at the end of the bill. Under the Senate rules, no discussion of the amendment was allowed and, although attempts were made to amend the amendment, it was passed as introduced. In this form, the amendment did <i>not</i> place liability on municipal corporations, but made any inhabitant of a municipality liable for damage inflicted by persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The House refused to acquiesce in a number of amendments made by the Senate, including the Sherman amendment, and the respective versions of H. R. 320 were therefore sent to a conference committee. Section 1 of the bill, however, was not a subject of this conference since, as noted, it was passed verbatim as introduced in both Houses of Congress.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 1871, the first conference committee completed its work on H. R. 320. The main features of the conference committee draft of the Sherman amendment were these:<sup>[15]</sup> First, a cause of action was given to persons injured by</p>\n<blockquote>\"any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together . . . with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude . . . .\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> Second, the bill provided that the action would be against the county, city, or parish in which the riot had occurred and that it could be maintained by either the person injured or his legal representative. Third, unlike the amendment as proposed, the conference substitute made the government defendant liable on the judgment if it was not satisfied against individual defendants who had committed the violence. If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property \"responsible\" for Ku Klux Klan damage.<sup>[16]</sup> Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.<sup>[17]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*668</span> Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House. House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported \u00a7 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters. And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform. This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <i>Monroe.</i><sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report. The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made \"any person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,\" who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.<sup>[20]</sup> The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1986.</p>\n<p>The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee. This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment\u0097on which our holding in <i>Monroe</i> was based, see <i>supra,</i> at 664\u0097would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights. Because \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret \u00a7 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the \"persons\" to whom that section applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Debate on the First Conference Report</h2>\n<p>The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States. Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality. Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on \u00a7 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes \"in the States,\" had also raised questions of federal power. The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that \"there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.\" Globe App. 67. There were analogies, however. With respect to the meaning of \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its Privileges or Immunities Clause, Shellabarger relied on the statement of Mr. Justice Washington in <i>Corfield</i> v. <i>Coryell,</i> 4 Wash. C. C. 371 (CC ED Pa. 1825), which defined the privileges protected by Art. IV:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`What these fundamental privileges are[,] it would perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may, however, be all comprehended under the following general heads: protection by the Government;'\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>\"Mark that</i>\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`<i>protection by the Government;</i> the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety . . . .'\" Globe App. 69 (emphasis added), quoting 4 Wash. C. C., at 380-381.</blockquote>\n<p>Building on his conclusion that citizens were owed protection\u0097a conclusion not disputed by opponents of the Sherman amendment<sup>[21]</sup>\u0097Shellabarger then considered Congress' role in providing that protection. Here again there were precedents:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Congress has always] assumed to enforce, as against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions of the Constitution. Most of the provisions of the Constitution which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in [Art. I, \u00a7 10,] relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments.. . . These prohibitions upon political powers of the States are all of such nature that they can be, and even have been, . . . enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers. Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States `enforced' these provisions of the Constitution. But there are some that are not of this class. These are where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"These three are: first, that as to fugitives from justice;<sup>[22]</sup> second, that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;)<sup>[23]</sup> third, that declaring that the `citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.'<sup>[24]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> \"And, sir, every one of these\u0097the only provisions where it was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the constitutional provisions\u0097the only three where the rights or liabilities of persons in the States, as between these persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect . . . such persons.\" Globe App. 69-70.</blockquote>\n<p>Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV\u0097the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302\u0097the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in <i>Prigg</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania,</i> 16 Pet. 539. There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found. 16 Pet., at 612. Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation. <i>Id.,</i> at 614. Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right and this in turn required a remedy, Story held it to be a \"natural inference\" that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right. <i>Id.,</i> at 615.</p>\n<p>Building on <i>Prigg,</i> Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate\u0097and hence constitutional\u0097method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen's federal right.<sup>[25]</sup> This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot.<sup>[26]</sup> Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*673</span> was \"whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, <i>any obligations to keep the peace</i> in obedience to United States laws.\"<sup>[27]</sup> This he answered affirmatively, citing <i>Board of Comm'rs</i> v. <i>Aspinwall,</i> 24 How. 376 (1861), the first of many cases<sup>[28]</sup> upholding the power of federal courts to enforce the Contract Clause against municipalities.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>House opponents of the Sherman amendment\u0097whose views are particularly important since only the House voted down the amendment\u0097did not dispute Shellabarger's claim that the Fourteenth Amendment created a federal right to protection, see n. 21, <i>supra,</i> but they argued that the local units of government upon which the amendment fastened liability were not obligated to keep the peace at state law and further that the Federal Government could not constitutionally require local governments to create police forces, whether this requirement was levied directly, or indirectly by imposing damages for breach of the peace on municipalities. The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair:<sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\"The proposition known as the Sherman amendment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*674</span>. . . is entirely new. It is altogether without a precedent in this country. . . . That amendment claims the power in the General Government to go into the States of this Union and lay such obligations as it may please upon the municipalities, which are the creations of the States alone. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\". . . [H]ere it is proposed, not to carry into effect an obligation which rests upon the municipality, but to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*675</span> create that obligation, and that is the provision I am unable to assent to. The parallel of the hundred does not in the least meet the case. The power that laid the obligation upon the hundred first put the duty upon the hundred that it should perform in that regard, and failing to meet the obligation which had been laid upon it, it was very proper that it should suffer damage for its neglect. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"... [T]here are certain rights and duties that belong to the States, . . . there are certain powers that inhere in the State governments. They create these municipalities, they say what their powers shall be and what their obligations shall be. If the Government of the United States can step in and add to those obligations, may it not utterly destroy the municipality? If it can say that it shall be liable for damages occurring from a riot, . . . where [will] its power . . . stop and what obligations . . . might [it] not lay upon a municipality. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Now, only the other day, the Supreme Court . . . decided [in <i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day,</i> 11 Wall. 113 (1871)] that there is no power in the Government of the United States, under its authority to tax, to tax the salary of a State officer. Why? Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect. It was held also in the case of Prigg <i>vs.</i> Pennsylvania [16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask . . . the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty.\" Globe 795.</blockquote>\n<p>Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught <span class=\"star-pagination\">*676</span> with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment. Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair's analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <i>Monroe,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.<sup>[31]</sup> Second, Blair's exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent\u0097albeit precedent that has not survived, see <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); <i>Graves</i> v. <i>New York ex rel. O'Keefe,</i> 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939)\u0097and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.</p>\n<p><i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day</i><i>,</i> cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives. There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were \"subject to the control of another and distinct government.\" 11 Wall., at 127. Although the Court in <i>Day</i> apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing \"power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax,\" <i>id.,</i> at 125-126; cf. <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*677</span> In <i>Prigg</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i><i>,</i> for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see <i>supra,</i> at 672, held that Congress could not \"insist that states . . . provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government.\" 16 Pet., at 615-616.<sup>[33]</sup> And Mr. Justice McLean agreed that, \"[a]s a general principle,\" it was true \"that Congress had no power to impose duties on state officers, as provided in the [Act of Feb. 12, 1793].\" Nonetheless he wondered whether Congress might not impose \"positive\" duties on state officers where a clause of the Constitution, like the Fugitive Slave Clause, seemed to require affirmative government assistance, rather than restraint of government, to secure federal rights. See <i>id.,</i> at 664-665.</p>\n<p>Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by \"positive\" action the protection<sup>[34]</sup> owed individuals under \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep the peace. However, any such argument, largely foreclosed by <i>Prigg,</i> was made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*678</span> impossible by the Court's holding in <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>Dennison,</i> 24 How. 66 (1861). There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by \u00a7 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793,<sup>[35]</sup> which implemented Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution. Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.\" 24 How., at 107-108.</blockquote>\n<p>The rationale of <i>Dennison</i>\u0097that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities\u0097is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in <i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day</i><i>.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 676. And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties. Although no one cited <i>Dennison</i> by name, the principle for which it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*679</span> stands was well known to Members of Congress,<sup>[36]</sup> many of whom discussed <i>Day</i><sup>[37]</sup> as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases<sup>[38]</sup> in the mid-1860's which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.<sup>[39]</sup> Thus, there was ample support for Blair's view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson's choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to \"destroy the government of the States.\" Globe 795.</p>\n<p>If municipal liability under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson's choice, we might conclude, as <i>Monroe</i> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the \"persons\" to which that section applied. But this is not the case.</p>\n<p>First, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*680</span> liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution\u0097which is as far as \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act went:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I presume . . . that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality . . . an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction. But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever.\" Globe 794.</blockquote>\n<p>Representative Burchard agreed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]here is no duty imposed by the Constitution of the United States, or usually by State laws, upon a county to protect the people of that county against the commission of the offenses herein enumerated, such as the burning of buildings or any other injury to property or injury to person. Police powers are not conferred upon counties as corporations; they are conferred upon cities that have qualified legislative power. And so far as cities are concerned, where the equal protection required to be afforded by a State is imposed upon a city by State laws, perhaps the United States courts could enforce its performance. But counties . . . do not have any control of the police . . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 795.</blockquote>\n<p>See also the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at n. 30, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it. Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <i>Prigg,</i> this is quite understandable. So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the \"positive\" government action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*681</span> required to protect federal constitutional rights and no question was raised of enlisting the States in \"positive\" action. The limits of the principles announced in <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day</i> are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history. It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered <i>Day</i> also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalities\u0097an enforcement effort which included various forms of \"positive\" relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found.<sup>[40]</sup> Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution's express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in <i>Dennison</i> or <i>Day,</i> have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary. Since \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0097a situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against municipalities\u0097there <span class=\"star-pagination\">*682</span> is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to \u00a7 1 suits against municipalities.</p>\n<p>Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment but who had voted for \u00a7 1, confirm that the liability imposed by \u00a7 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment. Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal <i>officials</i> who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law.<sup>[41]</sup> However, for <i>Prigg-Dennison-Day</i> purposes, as Blair and others recognized,<sup>[42]</sup> there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agents\u0097including corporate agents\u0097of the State: Both were state instrumentalities and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power. <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day,</i> after all, were not suits against municipalities but against <i>officers,</i> and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations.<sup>[43]</sup> Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of \u00a7 1\u0097<i>inter alia,</i> complaining that it would be applied to state officers, see Globe App. 217\u0097and who opposed both \u00a7 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on <i>Prigg</i> grounds, agreed unequivocally that \u00a7 1 was constitutional.<sup>[44]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*683</span> Those who voted for \u00a7 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite <i>Prigg, Dennison,</i> and <i>Day.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Bill</h2>\n<p>From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under \u00a7 1\u0097\"any person\"\u0097covers more than natural persons. An examination of the debate on \u00a7 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that \u00a7 1 was intended to cover legal as well as natural persons.</p>\n<p>Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship.\" Globe App. 68.</blockquote>\n<p>By extending a remedy to all people, including whites, \u00a7 1 went beyond the mischief to which the remaining sections of the 1871 Act were addressed. Representative Shellabarger also stated without reservation that the constitutionality of \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 controlled the constitutionality of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act, and that the former had been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*684</span> approved by \"the supreme courts of at least three States of this Union\" and by Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting on circuit, who had concluded: \"`We have no doubt of the constitutionality of every provision of this act.'\" Globe App. 68. Representative Shellabarger then went on to describe how the courts would and should interpret \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed. It would be most strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the rule of interpretation. As has been again and again decided by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and everywhere else where there is wise judicial interpretation, the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is uniformly given in construing such statutes and constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people. . . . Chief Justice Jay and also Story say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`Where a power is remedial in its nature there is much reason to contend that it ought to be construed liberally, and it is generally adopted in the interpretation of laws.'\u00971 <i>Story on Constitution,</i> sec. 429.\" Globe App., at 68.</blockquote>\n<p>The sentiments expressed in Representative Shellabarger's opening speech were echoed by Senator Edmunds, the manager of H. R. 320 in the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The first section is one that I believe nobody objects to, as defining the rights secured by the Constitution of the United States when they are assailed by any State law or under color of any State law, and it is merely carrying out the principles of the civil rights bill [of 1866], which have since become a part of the Constitution.\" Globe 568.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*685</span> \"[Section 1 is] so very simple and really re\u00ebnact[s] the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 569.</blockquote>\n<p>And he agreed that the bill \"secure[d] the rights of white men as much as of colored men.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 696.</p>\n<p>In both Houses, statements of the supporters of \u00a7 1 corroborated that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected civil rights.<sup>[45]</sup> Moreover, since municipalities through their official <span class=\"star-pagination\">*686</span> acts could, equally with natural persons, create the harms intended to be remedied by \u00a7 1, and, further, since Congress intended \u00a7 1 to be broadly construed, there is no reason to suppose that municipal corporations would have been excluded from the sweep of \u00a7 1. Cf., <i>e. g., </i><i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880); <i>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles,</i> 227 U. S. 278, 286-287, 294-296 (1913). One need not rely on this inference alone, however, for the debates show that Members of Congress understood \"persons\" to include municipal corporations.</p>\n<p>Representative Bingham, for example, in discussing \u00a7 1 of the bill, explained that he had drafted \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with the case of <i>Barron</i> v. <i>Mayor of Baltimore,</i> 7 Pet. 243 (1833), especially in mind. \"In [that] case the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*687</span> <i>city</i> had taken private property for public use, without compensation. . ., and there was no redress for the wrong . . . .\" Globe App. 84 (emphasis added). Bingham's further remarks clearly indicate his view that such takings by cities, as had occurred in <i>Barron,</i> would be redressable under \u00a7 1 of the bill. See Globe App. 85. More generally, and as Bingham's remarks confirm, \u00a7 1 of the bill would logically be the vehicle by which Congress provided redress for takings, since that section provided the only civil remedy for Fourteenth Amendment violations and that Amendment unequivocally prohibited uncompensated takings.<sup>[46]</sup> Given this purpose, it beggars reason to suppose that Congress would have exempted municipalities from suit, insisting instead that compensation for a taking come from an officer in his individual capacity rather than from the government unit that had the benefit of the property taken.<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis. This had not always been so. When this Court first considered the question of the status of corporations, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, denied that corporations \"as such\" were persons as that term was used in Art. III and the Judiciary Act of 1789. See <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809).<sup>[48]</sup> By 1844, however, the <i>Deveaux</i> doctrine was unhesitatingly abandoned:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] corporation created by and doing business in a particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*688</span> state, is to be deemed <i>to all intents and purposes as a person,</i> although an artificial person, . . . capable of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural person.\" <i>Louisville R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson,</i> 2 How. 497, 558 (1844) (emphasis added), discussed in Globe 752.</blockquote>\n<p>And only two years before the debates on the Civil Rights Act, in <i>Cowles</i> v. <i>Mercer County,</i> 7 Wall. 118, 121 (1869), the <i>Letson</i> principle was automatically and without discussion extended to municipal corporations. Under this doctrine, municipal corporations were routinely sued in the federal courts<sup>[49]</sup> and this fact was well known to Members of Congress.<sup>[50]</sup></p>\n<p>That the \"usual\" meaning of the word \"person\" would extend to municipal corporations is also evidenced by an Act of Congress which had been passed only months before the Civil Rights Act was passed. This Act provided that</p>\n<blockquote>\"in all acts hereafter passed . . . the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense.\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.</blockquote>\n<p>Municipal corporations in 1871 were included within the phrase \"bodies politic and corporate\"<sup>[51]</sup> and, accordingly, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*689</span> \"plain meaning\" of \u00a7 1 is that local government bodies were to be included within the ambit of the persons who could be sued under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act. Indeed, a Circuit Judge, writing in 1873 in what is apparently the first reported case under \u00a7 1, read the Dictionary Act in precisely this way in a case involving a corporate plaintiff and a municipal defendant.<sup>[52]</sup> See <i>Northwestern Fertilizing Co.</i> v. <i>Hyde Park,</i> 18 F. Cas. 393, 394 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873).<sup>[53]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> II</h2>\n<p>Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress <i>did</i> intend municipalities and other local government units to be included among those persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies.<sup>[54]</sup> Local governing bodies,<sup>[55]</sup> therefore, can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers. Moreover, although the touchstone of the \u00a7 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other \u00a7 1983 \"person,\" by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \"custom\" even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body's official decisionmaking channels. As Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said in <i>Adickes</i> v. <i>S. H. Kress &amp; Co.,</i> 398 U. S. 144, 167-168 (1970): \"Congress included customs and usages [in \u00a7 1983] because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials . . . . Although not authorized by written law, such practices of state officials could well be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a `custom or usage' with the force of law.\"<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, the language of \u00a7 1983, read against the background of the same legislative history, compels the conclusion that Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort. In particular, we conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable <i>solely</i> because it employs a tortfeasor\u0097or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a <i>respondeat superior</i> theory.</p>\n<p>We begin with the language of \u00a7 1983 as originally passed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[<i>A</i>]<i>ny person who,</i> under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, <i>shall subject, or cause to be subjected,</i> any person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*692</span> law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\" 17 Stat. 13 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The italicized language plainly imposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, \"causes\" an employee to violate another's constitutional rights. At the same time, that language cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor. Indeed, the fact that Congress did specifically provide that A's tort became B's liability if B \"caused\" A to subject another to a tort suggests that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1983 liability to attach where such causation was absent.<sup>[57]</sup> See <i>Rizzo</i> v. <i>Goode,</i> 423 U. S. 362, 370-371 (1976).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> Equally important, creation of a federal law of <i>respondeat superior</i> would have raised all the constitutional problems associated with the obligation to keep the peace, an obligation Congress chose not to impose because it thought imposition of such an obligation unconstitutional. To this day, there is disagreement about the basis for imposing liability on an employer for the torts of an employee when the sole nexus between the employer and the tort is the fact of the employer-employee relationship. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 69, p. 459 (4th ed. 1971). Nonetheless, two justifications tend to stand out. First is the common-sense notion that no matter how blameless an employer appears to be in an individual case, accidents might nonetheless be reduced if employers had to bear the cost of accidents. See, <i>e. g., ibid.;</i> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 26.3, pp. 1368-1369 (1956). Second is the argument that the cost of accidents should be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*694</span> spread to the community as a whole on an insurance theory. See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> \u00a7 26.5; Prosser, <i>supra,</i> at 459.<sup>[58]</sup></p>\n<p>The first justification is of the same sort that was offered for statutes like the Sherman amendment: \"The obligation to make compensation for injury resulting from riot is, by arbitrary enactment of statutes, affirmatory law, and the reason of passing the statute is to secure a more perfect police regulation.\" Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen). This justification was obviously insufficient to sustain the amendment against perceived constitutional difficulties and there is no reason to suppose that a more general liability imposed for a similar reason would have been thought less constitutionally objectionable. The second justification was similarly put forward as a justification for the Sherman amendment: \"we do not look upon [the Sherman amendment] as a punishment. . . . It is a mutual insurance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). Again, this justification was insufficient to sustain the amendment.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983. Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see <i>supra,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*695</span> 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below. In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 may be. We have attempted only to sketch so much of the \u00a7 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although we have stated that <i>stare decisis</i> has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 671, and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied <i>stare decisis</i> mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Continental T. V., Inc.</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Nor is this a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\" <i>Girouard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).</p>\n<p>First, <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under \u00a7 1983, was a departure from prior practice. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Northwestern Fertilizing Co.</i> v. <i>Hyde Park,</i> 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); <i>City of Manchester</i> v. <i>Leiby,</i> 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); <i>Hannan</i> v. <i>City of Haverhill,</i> 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>City of Jeannette,</i> 319 U. S. 157 (1943); <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in \u00a7 1983 suits.<sup>[59]</sup> Moreover, the constitutional defect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*696</span> that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration. See <i>supra,</i> at 673-682. For this reason, our cases\u0097decided both before and after <i>Monroe,</i> see n. 5, <i>supra</i>\u0097 holding school boards liable in \u00a7 1983 actions are inconsistent with <i>Monroe,</i> especially as <i>Monroe's</i> immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973).<sup>[60]</sup> And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not \"disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.\" <i>Brown Shoe Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (\"Those decisions are not cited as authority . . . but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench\"). Thus, while we have reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i> without further examination on three occasions,<sup>[61]</sup> it can scarcely be said that <i>Monroe</i> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.</p>\n<p>Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards. Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent. In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.<sup>[62]</sup> Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often <span class=\"star-pagination\">*697</span> defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been \u00a7 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.<sup>[63]</sup> Finally, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*698</span> regard to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in \u00a7 1983 suits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*699</span> to obtain attorney's fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local <i>bodies</i> or State or local officials. In such cases it is intended that the attorneys' fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, <i>in his official capacity,</i> from funds of his agency or under his control, or <i>from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).\"</i> S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Far from showing that Congress has relied on <i>Monroe,</i> therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <i>Monroe</i> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though <i>Monroe, City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> and <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.<sup>[64]</sup></p>\n<p>Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*700</span> support an absolute immunity. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <i>Monroe,</i> \"[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.\" 365 U. S., at 221-222 (dissenting in part). Indeed, municipalities simply cannot \"arrange their affairs\" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under \u00a7 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement. And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <i>Monroe</i> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.</p>\n<p>Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <i>Monroe</i><sup>[65]</sup>\u0097\"that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that <i>[Monroe]</i> misapprehended the meaning of the [section],\" 365 U. S., at 192 (concurring opinion)\u0097the overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it holds that local governments are not \"persons\" who may be defendants in \u00a7 1983 suits is clearly proper. It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress' view of the law, were \u00a7 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers. Yet everyone\u0097proponents and opponents alike\u0097knew \u00a7 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that \u00a7 1983 was constitutional. See <i>supra,</i> at 680-682. And, moreover, there can be no doubt that \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*701</span> rights. Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that \u00a7 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation\u0097which simply is not present\u0097there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the \"persons\" covered by \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that <i>stare decisis</i> does not bar our overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.<sup>[66]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under \u00a7 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 \"be drained of meaning,\" <i>Scheuer</i> v. <i>Rhodes,</i> 416 U.

JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court, and express these additional views.</p>\n<p>Few cases in the history of the Court have been cited more frequently than <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961), decided less than two decades ago. Focusing new light on 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*705</span> the 1871 measure. But <i>Monroe</i> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entities\u0097even when they act pursuant to express authorization. The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <i>Monroe</i> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court's opinion today. Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law,<sup>[1]</sup> the <i>Monroe</i> Court treated the 42d Congress' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury. That reading, in light of today's thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision,\" <i>Monroe, supra,</i> at 192 (Harlan, J., concurring). In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*706</span> with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. <i>Cleveland Board of Education</i> v. <i>LaFleur,</i> 414 U. S. 632 (1974), the Court decides \"not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late,\" <i>Henslee</i> v. <i>Union Planters Bank,</i> 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of \"riot act\" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness. As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 legislation\u0097now \u00a7 1983\u0097that \"any person\" acting \"under color of\" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that \"subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person . . . to the deprivation of any\" federal constitutional or statutory right. Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports <i>Monroe</i>'s observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally \"antagonistic,\" 365 U. S., at 191, to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation. Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal's unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of \u00a7 1983 judgment lienors. <i>Ante,</i> at 673-674, n. 30. The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment's attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces. <i>Ante,</i> at 673-675, 679-682.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*707</span> The Court correctly rejects a view of the legislative history that would produce the anomalous result of immunizing local government units from monetary liability for action directly causing a constitutional deprivation, even though such actions may be fully consistent with, and thus not remediable under, state law. No conduct of government comes more clearly within the \"under color of\" state law language of \u00a7 1983. It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be <i>exclusively</i> liable for resulting constitutional injury.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>As elaborated in Part II of today's opinion, the rejection of the Sherman amendment can best be understood not as evidence of Congress' acceptance of a rule of absolute municipal immunity but as a limitation of the statutory ambit to actual wrongdoers, <i>i. e.,</i> a rejection of <i>respondeat superior</i> or any other principle of vicarious liability. Cf. Levin, The Section 1983 Municipal Immunity Doctrine, 65 Geo. L. J. 1483, 1531-1535 (1977). Thus, it has been clear that a public official may be held liable in damages when his actions are found to violate a constitutional right and there is no qualified immunity, see <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Strickland,</i> 420 U. S. 308 (1975); <i>Procunier</i> v. <i>Navarette,</i> 434 U. S. 555 (1978). Today the Court recognizes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*708</span> that this principle also applies to a local government when implementation of its official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court traditionally has been hesitant to overrule prior constructions of statutes or interpretations of common-law rules. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy,\" <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but this cautionary principle must give way to countervailing considerations in appropriate circumstances.<sup>[4]</sup> I concur in the Court's view that this is not a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\" <i>Girouard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).</p>\n<p>Nor is this the usual case in which the Court is asked to overrule a precedent. Here considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> cut in both directions. On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983. On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to \u00a7 1983 suits.</p>\n<p>In <i>Monroe</i> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court\u0097 whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies. \"The theory of the complaint [in <i>Monroe</i> was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of <i>respondeat superior.</i>\" Brief for Petitioners, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*709</span> O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 21.<sup>[5]</sup> Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners' position would expose \"Chicago and every other municipality in the United States . . . to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of.\" Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 26. Thus the ground of decision in <i>Monroe</i> was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*710</span> Similarly, in <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973), petitioners asserted that \"the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff,\" <i>id.,</i> at 696, under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988. In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, 411 U. S., at 710, and n. 27, we reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i>'s reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to \"the holding in <i>Monroe</i> concerning the status under \u00a7 1983 of public entities such as the County,\" 411 U. S., at 700; Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.</p>\n<p>Only in <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973), did the Court confront a \u00a7 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury. In <i>Kenosha,</i> however, we raised the issue of the city's amenability to suit under \u00a7 1983 on our own initiative.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>This line of cases\u0097from <i>Monroe</i> to <i>Kenosha</i>\u0097is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*711</span> in which the Court has assumed <i>sub silentio</i> that some local government entities could be sued under \u00a7 1983. If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <i>Monroe,</i> grave doubt would be cast upon the Court's exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards. See <i>ante,</i> at 663 n. 5. Since \"the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards,\" <i>ante,</i> at 696, the conflict is squarely presented. Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Green</i> v. <i>County School Board,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 437-439, 441-442 (1968); <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S. 267, 292-293 (1977) (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment). And, as the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court's school board decisions in several statutes. Thus the exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding. Indeed, it predated <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which \"may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \u00a7 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908),\" <i>post,</i> at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents. At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief. <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Chesterfield County School Board,</i> 326 F. Supp. 1159, 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev'd, 474 F. 2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, 414 U. S. 632 (1974); <i>Tinker</i> v. <i>Des Moines Independent School Dist.,</i> 393 U. S. 503, 504 (1969). See also <i>Vlandis</i> v. <i>Kline,</i> 412 U. S. 441, 445 (1973). Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*712</span> for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable. Cf. <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651 (1974).<sup>[8]</sup> Moreover, the rationale of <i>Kenosha</i> would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under \u00a7 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government. The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of <i>Ex parte Young</i> into \u00a7 1983, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266 (CA2 1976). That approach, however, would create tension with <i>Kenosha</i> because it would require \"a bifurcated application\" of \"the generic word `person' in \u00a7 1983\" to public officials \"depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\" 412 U. S., at 513. A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a \"person\" for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-\"person\" in an action for damages. The Court's holding avoids this difficulty. See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 55.</p>\n<p>Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under \u00a7 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether \"we should, by analogy to our decision in <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U. S. 388 (1971), imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in \u00a7 1983 . . . .\" <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 278 (1977). One aspect of that inquiry would be whether there are any \"special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\" <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U. S. 388, 396 (1971), such as an \"explicit congressional declaration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*713</span> that persons injured by a [municipality] may not recover money damages . . ., but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the view of Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 397. In light of the Court's persuasive re-examination in today's decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from \u00a7 1983 \"an explicit congressional declaration\" against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution. Rather than constitutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Difficult questions nevertheless remain for another day. There are substantial line-drawing problems in determining \"when execution of a government's policy or custom\" can be said to inflict constitutional injury such that \"government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 694. This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board; it is the clear case. The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity. <i>Ante,</i> at 701. Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see <i>post,</i> at 720-721, or other principles support a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*714</span> qualified municipal immunity in the context of the \u00a7 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>Since Parts II and IV of the opinion of the Court are merely advisory and are not necessary to explain the Court's decision, I join only Parts I, III, and V.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years ago, in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a \"person\" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions. <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973). See also <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 277-279 (1977). Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961. Because I cannot agree that this Court is \"free to disregard these precedents,\" which have been \"considered maturely and recently\" by this Court, <i>Runyon</i> v. <i>McCrary,</i> 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As this Court has repeatedly recognized, <i>id.,</i> at 175 n. 12; <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation. In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court's settled construction of the law, but the Congress is at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*715</span> liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit. The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. . . . This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.\" <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406-407 (1932) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Only the most compelling circumstances can justify this Court's abandonment of such firmly established statutory precedents. The best exposition of the proper burden of persuasion was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan in <i>Monroe</i> itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\"From my point of view, the policy of <i>stare decisis,</i> as it should be applied in matters of statutory construction, and, to a lesser extent, the indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation, require that it appear <i>beyond doubt</i> from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>United States</i> v.] <i>Classic,</i> [313 U. S. 299 (1941)] and <i>Screws</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> 325 U. S. 91 (1945)] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision, before a departure from what was decided in those cases would be justified.\" 365 U. S., at 192 (concurring opinion) (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court does not demonstrate that any exception to this general rule is properly applicable here. The Court's first assertion, that <i>Monroe</i> \"was a departure from prior practice,\" <i>ante,</i> at 695, is patently erroneous. Neither in <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>City of Jeannette,</i> 319 U. S. 157 (1943), nor in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*716</span> 350 U. S. 879 (1955), nor in any of the school board cases cited by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 663 n. 5, was the question now before us raised by any of the litigants or addressed by this Court. As recently as four Terms ago, we said in <i>Hagans</i> v. <i>Lavine,</i> 415 U. S. 528, 535 n. 5 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions <i>sub silentio,</i> this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The source of this doctrine that jurisdictional issues decided <i>sub silentio</i> are not binding in other cases seems to be Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's remark in <i>United States</i> v. <i>More,</i> 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805).<sup>[1]</sup> While the Chief Justice also said that such decisions may \"have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench,\" <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809), unconsidered assumptions of jurisdiction simply cannot outweigh four consistent decisions of this Court, explicitly considering and rejecting that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any indication that any later Congress has ever approved suit against any municipal corporation under \u00a7 1983. Of all its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, \u00a7 2, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871.<sup>[2]</sup> The 1976 Act provides that attorney's fees may be awarded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*717</span> to the prevailing party \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title.\" There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections; it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney's fees. As the Court admits, <i>ante,</i> at 699, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed \"whether or not the agency or government is a named party,\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well-known holding of <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's assertion that municipalities have no right to act \"on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely,\" <i>ante,</i> at 700, is simply beside the point. Since <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights. No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of <i>stare decisis.</i> To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL's view that \"[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6. Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being <span class=\"star-pagination\">*718</span> obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind. To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), forward, in which the explicit ground of decision \"was never actually briefed or argued,\" <i>ante,</i> at 708 (POWELL, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law. Indeed, in <i>Marbury</i> itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicants\u0097which, unlike the arguments in <i>Monroe,</i> is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see it\u0097devotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress. Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance. 1 Cranch, at 153-154. More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother POWELL'S analysis. In <i>Mapp</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 367 U. S. 643 (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule <i>Wolf</i> v. <i>Colorado,</i> 338 U. S. 25 (1949); it did so only at the request of an <i>amicus curiae.</i> 367 U. S., at 646 n. 3. That <i>Marbury, Mapp,</i> and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary byproduct of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present \"all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6 (POWELL, J., concurring). While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress. That intent was first expounded in <i>Monroe,</i> and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*719</span> has been followed consistently ever since. This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference. Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <i>Monroe.</i> 124 Cong. Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978). In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of <i>stare decisis</i> require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings. <i>Monroe</i> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated \"beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>Monroe</i>] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\" <i>Monroe,</i> 365 U. S., at 192 (Harlan, J., concurring). The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting \u00a7 1, it intended to impose that liability. I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Any analysis of the meaning of the word \"person\" in \u00a7 1983, which was originally enacted as \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act. The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"That in all acts hereafter passed . . . the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense . . . .\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.</blockquote>\n<p>The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word \"person\" where the context suggests a more limited reach. Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*720</span> in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person. Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act's provision that \"words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females,\" might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).</p>\n<p>There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted \u00a7 1983 may well have intended the word \"person\" \"to be used in a more limited sense,\" as <i>Monroe</i> concluded. It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, <i>Louisville R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson,</i> 2 How. 497, 558 (1844), and municipal corporations, <i>Cowles</i> v. <i>Mercer County,</i> 7 Wall. 118, 121 (1869), were \"citizens\" of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III. Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court, in <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 8 Wall. 168 (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be \"citizens\" within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 2. Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts. Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that \u00a7 1 \"was so very simple and really reenact[ed] the Constitution.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds). At the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a \"citizen\" nor a \"person.\" <i>Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>New Orleans,</i> 13 F. Cas. 67 (No. 7,052) (CC La. 1870).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the state courts did not speak with a single voice with regard to the tort liability of municipal corporations. Although many Members of Congress represented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*721</span> States which had retained absolute municipal tort immunity, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Irvine</i> v. <i>Town of Greenwood,</i> 89 S. C. 511, 72 S. E. 228 (1911) (collecting earlier cases), other States had adopted the currently predominant distinction imposing liability for proprietary acts, see generally 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \u00a7 29.6 (1956), as early as 1842, <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Mayor of City of New York,</i> 3 Hill 531 (N. Y. 1842). Nevertheless, no state court had ever held that municipal corporations were always liable in tort in precisely the same manner as other persons.</p>\n<p>The general remarks from the floor on the liberal purposes of \u00a7 1 offer no explicit guidance as to the parties against whom the remedy could be enforced. As the Court concedes, only Representative Bingham raised a concern which could be satisfied only by relief against governmental bodies. Yet he never directly related this concern to \u00a7 1 of the Act. Indeed, Bingham stated at the outset, \"I do not propose now to discuss the provisions of the bill in detail,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 82 (1871), and, true to his word, he launched into an extended discourse on the beneficent purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. While Bingham clearly stated that Congress could \"provide that no citizen in any State shall be deprived of his property by State law or the judgment of a State court without just compensation therefor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 85, he never suggested that such a power was exercised in \u00a7 1.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*722</span> Finally, while Bingham has often been advanced as the chief expositor of the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Duncan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 391 U. S. 145, 165 (1968) (Black, J., concurring); <i>Adamson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 332 U. S. 46, 73-74 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting), there is nothing to indicate that his colleagues placed any greater credence in his theories than has this Court. See <i>Duncan, supra,</i> at 174-176 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <i>Adamson, supra,</i> at 64 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Thus, it ought not lightly to be presumed, as the Court does today, <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 53, that \u00a7 1983 \"should prima facie be construed to include `bodies politic' among the entities that could be sued.\" Neither the Dictionary Act, the ambivalent state of judicial decisions, nor the floor debate on \u00a7 1 of the Act gives any indication that any Member of Congress had any inkling that \u00a7 1 could be used to impose liability on municipalities. Although Senator Thurman, as the Court emphasizes, <i>ante,</i> at 686 n. 45, expressed his belief that the terms of \u00a7 1 \"are as comprehensive as can be used,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871), an examination of his lengthy remarks demonstrates that it never occurred to him that \u00a7 1 did impose or could have imposed any liability upon municipal corporations. In an extended parade of horribles, this \"old Roman,\" who was one of the Act's most implacable opponents, suggested that state legislatures, Members of Congress, and state judges might be held liable under the Act. <i>Ibid.</i> If, at that point in the debate, he had any idea that \u00a7 1 was designed to impose tort liability upon cities and counties, he would surely have raised an additional outraged objection. Only once was that possibility placed squarely before the Congress\u0097in its consideration of the Sherman amendment\u0097and the Congress squarely rejected it.</p>\n<p>The Court is probably correct that the rejection of the Sherman amendment does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Congress intended municipalities to be immune from liability under all circumstances. Nevertheless, it cannot be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*723</span> denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress' understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context. Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can we levy on the court-house and sell it? So this section provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action <i>ex delicto,</i> where the county has never entered into any contract, where the State has never authorized the county to assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability upon it. It is in my opinion simply absurd.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 799 (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).</blockquote>\n<p>Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented. Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended \u00a7 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of \"person,\" and thus the reasoning of <i>Monroe</i> on this point is subject to challenge. The meaning of \u00a7 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <i>Monroe,</i> and it may well be that on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates a conclusion contrary to the <i>Monroe</i> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago. But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*724</span> Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on \u00a7 1 that the word \"person\" was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing \"beyond doubt\" that this Court in <i>Monroe</i> \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\" Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <i>Monroe</i> do not end the inquiry as to <i>stare decisis;</i> they merely begin it. I would adhere to the holding of <i>Monroe</i> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The decision in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years. Using \u00a7 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <i>Monroe</i> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials' failure to predict the course of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence. None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today's removal of that protection. Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today's decision.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Michael H.

See <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507, 517-520 (1973). However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U.

S. 693, 708 (1973), and the debates do not support this position.</p>\n<p>[10]  Globe 522.</p>\n<p>[11]  Briefly, \u00a7 2 created certain federal crimes in addition to those defined in \u00a7 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, 14 Stat. 27, each aimed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan. Section 3 provided that the President could send the militia into any State wracked with Klan violence. Finally, \u00a7 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant. See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335-336 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.).</p>\n<p>[12]  Globe 709.</p>\n<p>[13]  See <i>id.,</i> at 663, quoted in Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 702-703.</p>\n<p>[14]  <i>Ibid.</i> An action for recovery of damages was to be in the federal courts and denominated as a suit against the county, city, or parish in which the damage had occurred. <i>Ibid.</i> Execution of the judgment was not to run against the property of the government unit, however, but against the private property of any inhabitant. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[15]  See Globe 749 and 755, quoted in Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 703-704.</p>\n<p>[16]  \"Let the people of property in the southern States understand that if they will not make the hue and cry and take the necessary steps to put down lawless violence in those States their property will be holden responsible, and the effect will be most wholesome.\" Globe 761.\n</p>\n<p>Senator Sherman was apparently unconcerned that the conference committee substitute, unlike the original amendment, did not place liability for riot damage directly on the property of the well-to-do, but instead placed it on the local government. Presumably he assumed that taxes would be levied against the property of the inhabitants to make the locality whole.</p>\n<p>[17]  According to Senator Sherman, the law had originally been adopted in England immediately after the Norman Conquest and had most recently been promulgated as the law of 7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4, ch. 31 (1827). See Globe 760. During the course of the debates, it appeared that Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York had similar laws. See <i>id.,</i> at 751 (Rep. Shellabarger); <i>id.,</i> at 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <i>id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). Such a municipal liability was apparently common throughout New England. See <i>id.,</i> at 761 (Sen. Sherman).</p>\n<p>[18]  In the Senate, opponents, including a number of Senators who had voted for \u00a7 1 of the bill, criticized the Sherman amendment as an imperfect and impolitic rendering of the state statutes. Moreover, as drafted, the conference substitute could be construed to protect rights that were not protected by the Constitution. A complete critique was given by Senator Thurman. See Globe 770-772.</p>\n<p>[19]  See 365 U. S., at 190, quoted <i>supra,</i> at 664.</p>\n<p>[20]  See Globe 804, quoted in Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 704.</p>\n<p>[21]  See Globe 758 (Sen. Trumbull); <i>id.,</i> at 772 (Sen. Thurman); <i>id.,</i> at 791 (Rep. Willard). The Supreme Court of Indiana had so held in giving effect to the Civil Rights Act of 1866. See <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Moody,</i> 26 Ind. 299 (1866) (following <i>Coryell</i>), one of three State Supreme Court cases referred to in Globe App. 68 (Rep. Shellabarger). Moreover, \u00a7 2 of the 1871 Act as passed, unlike \u00a7 1, prosecuted persons who violated federal rights whether or not that violation was under color of official authority, apparently on the theory that Ku Klux Klan violence was infringing the right of protection defined by <i>Coryell.</i> Nonetheless, opponents argued that municipalities were not generally charged by the States with keeping the peace and hence did not have police forces, so that the duty to afford protection ought not devolve on the municipality, but on whatever agency of state government was charged by the State with keeping the peace. See <i>infra,</i> at 673, and n. 30. In addition, they argued that Congress could not constitutionally add to the duties of municipalities. See <i>infra,</i> at 673-678.</p>\n<p>[22]  U. S. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 2:\n</p>\n<p>\"A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\"</p>\n<p>[23]  <i>Id.,</i> cl. 3:\n</p>\n<p>\"No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.\"</p>\n<p>[24]  <i>Id.,</i> cl. 1.</p>\n<p>[25]  See Globe 751.

Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position: He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection. That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc. He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the <i>States</i> the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated. See <i>id.,</i> at 791.\n</p>\n<p>Opponents of the Sherman amendment in the Senate agreed with Blair that Congress had no power to pass the Sherman amendment because it fell outside limits on national power implicit in the federal structure of the Constitution and recognized in, <i>e. g., </i><i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day,</i> 11 Wall. 113 (1871). However, the Senate opponents focused not on the amendment's attempt to obligate municipalities to keep the peace, but on the lien created by the amendment, which ran against <i>all</i> money and property of a defendant municipality, including property held for public purposes, such as jails or courthouses. Opponents argued that such a lien once entered would have the effect of making it impossible for the municipality to function, since no one would trade with it. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Globe 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 763 (Sen. Casserly). Moreover, everyone knew that sound policy prevented execution against public property since this, too, was needed if local government was to survive. See, <i>e. g., ibid.</i> See also <i>Meriwether</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> 102 U. S. 472, 501, 513 (1880) (recognizing principle that public property of a municipality was not subject to execution); 2 J.

(same).</p>\n<p>Although the arguments of the Senate opponents appear to be a correct analysis of then-controlling constitutional and common-law principles, their arguments are not relevant to an analysis of the constitutionality of \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act since any judgment under that section, as in any civil suit in the federal courts in 1871, would have been enforced pursuant to <i>state</i> laws under the Process Acts of 1792 and 1828.

Instead, the distinction must have been that a violation of the Constitution was the predicate for \"positive\" relief in the Contract Clause cases, whereas the Sherman amendment imposed damages without regard to whether a local government was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages. See <i>supra,</i> at 668. While no one stated this distinction expressly during the debates, the inference is strong that Congressmen in 1871 would have drawn this distinction since it explains why Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <i>supra,</i> at 680, could oppose the amendment while at the same time saying that the Federal Government might impose damages on a local government that had defaulted in a state-imposed duty to keep the peace, and it also explains why everyone agreed that a state or municipal officer could constitutionally be held liable under \u00a7 1 for violations of the Constitution.

He continued:\n</p>\n<p>\"The States never had the right, though they had the power, to inflict wrongs upon free citizens by a denial of the full protection of the laws . . . .

Mercur).</p>\n<p>Other supporters were quite clear that \u00a7 1 of the Act extended a remedy not only where a State had passed an unconstitutional statute, but also where officers of the State were deliberately indifferent to the rights of black citizens:</p>\n<p>\"But the chief complaint is ... [that] by a systematic maladministration of [state law], or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.

S., at 171-187.</p>\n<p>Importantly for our inquiry, even the opponents of \u00a7 1 agreed that it was constitutional and, further, that it swept very broadly. Thus, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of \u00a7 1, said:</p>\n<p>\"This section relates wholly to civil suits. . . . Its whole effect is to give to the Federal Judiciary that which now does not belong to it\u0097<i>a jurisdiction that may be constitutionally conferred upon it, I grant,</i> but that has never yet been conferred upon it. It authorizes any person who is deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, to bring an action against the wrong-doer in the Federal courts, and that without any limit whatsoever as to the amount in controversy. . . .</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"<i>[T]here is no limitation whatsoever upon the terms that are employed</i> [<i>in the bill</i>], <i>and they are as comprehensive as can be used.</i>\" Globe App. 216-217 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[46]  See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1956 (T. Cooley ed. 1873).</p>\n<p>[47]  Indeed the federal courts found no obstacle to awards of damages against municipalities for common-law takings. See <i>Sumner</i> v. <i>Philadelphia,</i> 23 F. Cas. 392 (No. 13,611) (CC ED Pa. 1873) (awarding damages of $2,273.36 and costs of $346.35 against the city of Philadelphia).</p>\n<p>[48]  Nonetheless, suits could be brought in federal court if the natural persons who were members of the corporation were of diverse citizenship from the other parties to the litigation.

Cas. 393, 394 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *278-*279 (12th O. W. Holmes ed. 1873). See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Maurice,</i> 2 Brock. 96, 109 (CC Va. 1823) (Marshall, C. J.) (\"The United States is a government, and, consequently, a body politic and corporate\"); Apps. D and E to Brief for Petitioners in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1960, No. 39 (collecting state statutes which, in 1871, defined municipal corporations as bodies politic and corporate).</p>\n<p>[52]  The court also noted that there was no discernible reason why persons injured by municipal corporations should not be able to recover. See 18 F. Cas., at 394.</p>\n<p>[53]  In considering the effect of the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, in <i>Monroe,</i> however, Mr. Justice Douglas, apparently focusing on the word \"may,\" stated: \"[T]his definition [of person] is merely an allowable, not a mandatory, one.\" 365 U. S., at 191. A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.\n</p>\n<p>There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of \"person,\" but Senator Trumbull, the Act's sponsor, discussed the phrase \"words importing the masculine gender <i>may</i> be applied to. females,\" (emphasis added), which immediately precedes the definition of \"person,\" and stated:</p>\n<p>\"The only object [of the Act] is to get rid of a great deal of verbosity in our statutes by providing that when the word `he' is used it <i>shall</i> include females as well as males.\" Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thus, in Trumbull's view the word \"may\" meant \"shall.\" Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is also required for it to perform its intended function\u0097to be a guide to \"rules of construction\" of Acts of Congress. See <i>ibid.</i> (remarks of Sen. Trumbull). Were the defined words \"allowable, [but] not mandatory\" constructions, as <i>Monroe</i> suggests, there would be no \"rules\" at all. Instead, Congress must have intended the definitions of the Act to apply across-the-board except where the Act by its terms called for a deviation from this practice\u0097\"[where] the context shows that [defined] words were to be used in a more limited sense.\" Certainly this is how the <i>Northwestern Fertilizing</i> court viewed the matter. Since there is nothing in the \"context\" of \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word \"person,\" the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include \"bodies politic\" among the entities that could be sued.</p>\n<p>[54]  There is certainly no constitutional impediment to municipal liability. \"The Tenth Amendment's reservation of nondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal-court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S. 267, 291 (1977); see <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S., at 347-348. For this reason, <i>National League of Cities</i> v. <i>Usery,</i> 426 U. S. 833 (1976), is irrelevant to our consideration of this case. Nor is there any basis for concluding that the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to municipal liability. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> 427 U. S. 445, 456 (1976); <i>Lincoln County</i> v. <i>Luning,</i> 133 U. S. 529, 530 (1890). Our holding today is, of course, limited to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p>[55]  Since official-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent\u0097at least where Eleventh Amendment considerations do not control analysis\u0097 our holding today that local governments can be sued under \u00a7 1983 necessarily decides that local government officials sued in their official capacities are \"persons\" under \u00a7 1983 in those cases in which, as here, a local government would be suable in its own name.</p>\n<p>[56]  See also Mr. Justice Frankfurter's statement for the Court in <i>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Browning,</i> 310 U. S. 362, 369 (1940):\n</p>\n<p>\"It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice . . . can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\"</p>\n<p>[57]  Support for such a conclusion can be found in the legislative history. As we have indicated, there is virtually no discussion of \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act. Again, however, Congress' treatment of the Sherman amendment gives a clue to whether it would have desired to impose <i>respondeat superior</i> liability.\n</p>\n<p>The primary constitutional justification for the Sherman amendment was that it was a necessary and proper remedy for the failure of localities to protect citizens as the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required. See <i>supra,</i> at 670-673. And according to Sherman, Shellabarger, and Edmunds, the amendment came into play only when a locality was at fault or had knowingly neglected its duty to provide protection. See Globe 761 (Sen. Sherman); <i>id.,</i> at 756 (Sen. Edmunds); <i>id.,</i> at 751-752 (Rep. Shellabarger). But other proponents of the amendment apparently viewed it as a form of vicarious liability for the unlawful acts of the citizens of the locality. See <i>id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). And whether intended or not, the amendment as drafted did impose a species of vicarious liability on municipalities since it could be construed to impose liability even if a municipality did not know of an impending or ensuing riot or did not have the wherewithal to do anything about it. Indeed, the amendment held a municipality liable even if it had done everything in its power to curb the riot. See <i>supra,</i> at 668; Globe 761 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <i>id.,</i> at 788 (Rep. Kerr); <i>id.,</i> at 791 (Rep. Willard). While the first conference substitute was rejected principally on constitutional grounds, see <i>id.,</i> at 804 (Rep. Poland), it is plain from the text of the second conference substitute\u0097which limited liability to those who, having the power to intervene against Ku Klux Klan violence, \"neglect[ed] or refuse[d] so to do,\" see Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 704, and which was enacted as \u00a7 6 of the 1871 Act and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1986\u0097that Congress also rejected those elements of vicarious liability contained in the first conference substitute even while accepting the basic principle that the inhabitants of a community were bound to provide protection against the Ku Klux Klan. Strictly speaking, of course, the fact that Congress refused to impose vicarious liability for the wrongs of a few private citizens does not conclusively establish that it would similarly have refused to impose vicarious liability for the torts of a municipality's employees. Nonetheless, when Congress' rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in \u00a7 1983 which can easily be construed to create <i>respondeat superior</i> liability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.</p>\n<p>[58]  A third justification, often cited but which on examination is apparently insufficient to justify the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior,</i> see, <i>e. g.,</i> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, \u00a7 26.3, is that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor. By our decision in <i>Rizzo</i> v. <i>Goode,</i> 423 U. S. 362 (1976), we would appear to have decided that the mere right to control without any control or direction having been exercised and without any failure to supervise is not enough to support \u00a7 1983 liability. See 423 U. S., at 370-371.</p>\n<p>[59]  Each case cited by <i>Monroe,</i> see 365 U. S., at 191 n. 50, as consistent with the position that local governments were not \u00a7 1983 \"persons\" reached its conclusion by assuming that state-law immunities overrode the \u00a7 1983 cause of action. This has never been the law.</p>\n<p>[60]  Although many suits against school boards also include private individuals as parties, the \"principal defendant is usually the local board of education or school board.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S., at 292-293 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>[61]  <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976).</p>\n<p>[62]  During the heyday of the furor over busing, both the House and the Senate refused to adopt bills that would have removed from the federal courts jurisdiction\n</p>\n<p>\"to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order requiring any <i>school board</i> to make any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any <i>school board</i> to transport any students from one public school to another public school or from one place to another place or from one school district to another school district in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body at any school or place or in any school district, or denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any <i>school board</i> to close any school and transfer the students from the closed school to any other school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body at any public school, or precluding any <i>school board</i> from carrying into effect any provision of any contract between it and any member of the faculty of any public school it operates specifying the public school where the member of the faculty is to perform his or her duties under the contract.\" S. 1737, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 1207 (1973) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Other bills designed either completely to remove the federal courts from the school desegregation controversy, S. 287, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), or to limit the ability of federal courts to subject school boards to remedial orders in desegregation cases, S. 619, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973); S. 179, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 2 (a) (1973); H. R. 13534, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 1 (1972), have similarly failed.</p>\n<p>[63]  In 1972, spurred by a finding \"that the process of eliminating or preventing minority group isolation and improving the quality of education for all children often involves the expenditure of additional funds to which local educational agencies do not have access,\" 86 Stat. 354, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1601 (a) (1976 ed.), Congress passed the Emergency School Aid Act. Section 706 (a) (1) (A) (i) of that Act, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1605 (a) (1) (A) (i) (1976 ed.), authorizes the Assistant Secretary\n</p>\n<p>\"to make a grant to, or a contract with, <i>a local educational agency [w]hich is implementing a plan . . . which has been undertaken pursuant to a final</i> <i>order issued by a court of the United States</i> . . . which requires the desegregation of minority group segregated children or faculty in the elementary and secondary schools of such agency, or otherwise requires the elimination or reduction of minority group isolation in such schools.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>A \"local educational agency\" is defined by 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1619 (8) (1976 ed.) as \"a public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control or direction of, public elementary or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State, or a federally recognized Indian reservation, or such combination of school districts, or counties as are recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools, or a combination of local educational agencies . . . .\" Congress thus clearly recognized that school boards were often parties to federal school desegregation suits. In \u00a7 718 of the Act, 86 Stat. 369, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1617 (1976 ed.), Congress gave its explicit approval to the institution of federal desegregation suits against school boards\u0097presumably under \u00a7 1983. Section 718 provides:</p>\n<p>\"Upon the entry of a final order <i>by a court of the United States against a local educational agency</i> . . . for discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in violation of . . . the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . . the court . . . may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Two years later in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, Congress found that \"the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required <i>local educational agencies</i> to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources . . . .\" 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1702 (a) (3) (1976 ed.). (Emphasis added.) Congress did not respond by declaring that school boards were not subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 or any other federal statute, \"but simply [legislated] revised evidentiary standards and remedial priorities to be employed by the courts in deciding such cases.\" Brief for National Education Assn. et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15-16. Indeed, Congress expressly reiterated that a cause of action, cognizable in the federal courts, exists for discrimination in the public school context. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703, 1706, 1708, 1710, 1718 (1976 ed.). The Act assumes that school boards will usually be the defendants in such suits. For example, \u00a7 211 of the Act, 88 Stat. 516, as set forth in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1710 (1976 ed.), provides:</p>\n<p>\"The Attorney General shall not institute a civil action under section 1706 of this title [which allows for suit by both private parties and the Attorney General to redress discrimination in public education] before he\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(a) gives to the appropriate educational agency notice of the condition or conditions which, in his judgment, constitute a violation of part 2 [the prohibitions against discrimination in public education].\" Section 219 of the Act, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1718 (1976 ed.), provides for the termination of court-ordered busing \"if the court finds the defendant educational agency has satisfied the requirements of the fifth or fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, whichever is applicable, and will continue to be in compliance with the requirements thereof.\"</p>\n<p>[64]  Whether Congress' attempt is in fact effective is the subject of <i>Hutto</i> v. <i>Finney,</i> O. T. 1977, No. 76-1660, cert. granted, 434 U. S. 901, and therefore we express no view on it here.</p>\n<p>[65]  We note, however, that Mr. Justice Harlan's test has not been expressly adopted by this Court. Moreover, that test is based on two factors: <i>stare decisis</i> and \"indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation [of the statute in question].\" 365 U. S., at 192. As we have explained, the second consideration is not present in this case.</p>\n<p>[66]  No useful purpose would be served by an attempt at this late date to determine whether <i>Monroe</i> was correct on its facts. Similarly, since this case clearly involves official policy and does not involve <i>respondeat superior,</i> we do not assay a view on how our cases which have relied on that aspect of <i>Monroe</i> that is overruled today\u0097<i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); and <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976)\u0097should have been decided on a correct view of \u00a7 1983. Nothing we say today affects the conclusion reached in <i>Moor,</i> see 411 U. S., at 703-704, that 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 cannot be used to create a federal cause of action where \u00a7 1983 does not otherwise provide one, or the conclusion reached in <i>City of Kenosha,</i> see 412 U. S., at 513, that \"nothing . . . suggest[s] that the generic word `person' in \u00a7 1983 was intended to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  The gravamen of the complaint in <i>Monroe</i> was that Chicago police officers acting \"under color of\" state law had conducted a warrantless, early morning raid and ransacking of a private home. Although at least one of the allegations in the complaint could have been construed to charge a custom or usage of the Police Department of the city of Chicago that did not violate state law, see 365 U. S., at 258-259 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part), and there is a hint of such a theory in Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, pp. 41-42, that feature of the case was not highlighted in this Court. The dispute that divided the Court was over whether a complaint alleging police misconduct in violation of state law, for which state judicial remedies were available, stated a \u00a7 1983 claim in light of the statutory requirement that the conduct working injury be \"under color of\" state law. Compare 365 U. S., at 172-183 (opinion of the Court), and <i>id.,</i> at 193-202 (Harlan, J., concurring), with <i>id.,</i> at 202-259 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  If in the view of House opponents, such as Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <i>ante,</i> at 679-680, a municipality obligated by state law to keep the peace could be held liable for a failure to provide equal protection against private violence, it seems improbable that they would have opposed imposition of liability on a municipality for the affirmative implementation of policies promulgated within its proper sphere of operation under state law. Such liability is premised not on a failure to take affirmative action in an area outside the contemplation of the state-law charter\u0097the sort of liability that would have been imposed by the Sherman amendment\u0097but on the consequences of activities actually undertaken within the scope of the powers conferred by state law.</p>\n<p>[3]  The view taken today is consistent with the understanding of the 42d Congress that unless the context revealed a more limited definition, \"the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . .\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431. It also accords with the interpretation given the same word when it was used by Senator Sherman in the antitrust legislation of 1890 bearing his name.

S. 393, 406-407, n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[5]  The District Court in <i>Monroe</i> ruled in the municipality's favor, stating: \"[S]ince the liability of the City of Chicago is based on the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior,</i> and since I have already held that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief against the agents of the city, there is no claim for relief against the city itself.\" Record, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 30. The Court of Appeals affirmed for the same reason. 272 F. 2d 365-366 (CA7 1959).\n</p>\n<p>Petitioners in this Court also offered an alternative argument that the city of Chicago was a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 25, but the underlying theory of municipal liability remained one of <i>respondeat superior.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> advances two important values of a rational system of law: (i) the certainty of legal principles and (ii) the wisdom of the conservative vision that existing rules should be presumed rational and not subject to modification \"at any time a new thought seems appealing,\" dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, <i>post,</i> at 718; cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law 36 (1881). But, at the same time, the law has recognized the necessity of change, lest rules \"simply persis[t] from blind imitation of the past.\" Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). Any overruling of prior precedent, whether of a constitutional decision or otherwise, disserves to some extent the value of certainty. But I think we owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations. That is the premise of the canon of interpretation that language in a decision not necessary to the holding may be accorded less weight in subsequent cases. I also would recoguize the fact that until this case the Court has not had to confront squarely the consequences of holding \u00a7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, the mere fact that an issue was not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding. <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), cited by the dissent, <i>post,</i> at 718, is a case in point. But the Court's recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in <i>Marbury.</i> And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the <i>Marbury</i> holding. In <i>Monroe,</i> on the other hand, the Court's rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner. The language in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding \u00a7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies. It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today's re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.</p>\n<p>[7]  In <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1, 16 (1976), we reaffirmed <i>Monroe,</i> but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of \u00a7 1983 under <i>Monroe,</i> and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim. Similarly, the parties in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274 (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested. There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.</p>\n<p>[9]  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST'S dissent makes a strong argument that \"[s]ince <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights.\" <i>Post,</i> at 717. But it reasonably may be assumed that most municipalities already indemnify officials sued for conduct within the scope of their authority, a policy that furthers the important interest of attracting and retaining competent officers, board members, and employees. In any event, the possibility of a qualified immunity, as to which the Court reserves decision, may remove some of the harshness of liability for good-faith failure to predict the often uncertain course of constitutional adjudication.</p>\n<p>[1]  As we pointed out in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983 is \"jurisdictional\" for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343, even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. See <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Hood,</i> 327 U. S. 678, 682 (1946).</p>\n<p>[2]  The other statutes cited by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of \u00a7 1983, but refer generally to suits against \"a local educational agency.\" As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266, such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \u00a7 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted. The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages. Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.</p>\n<p>[3]  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of <i>Monroe,</i> my Brother POWELL relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that \"the exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction . . . [was] perhaps not premised on considered holdings.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 711.</p>\n<p>[4]  It has not been generally thought, before today, that \u00a7 1983 provided an avenue of relief from unconstitutional takings. Those federal courts which have granted compensation against state and local governments have resorted to an implied right of action under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <i>Richmond Elks Hall Assn.</i> v. <i>Richmond Redevelopment Agency,</i> 561 F. 2d 1327 (CA9 1977), aff'g 389 F. Supp. 486 (ND Cal. 1975); <i>Foster</i> v. <i>Detroit,</i> 405 F. 2d 138, 140 (CA6 1968). Since the Court today abandons the holding of <i>Monroe</i> chiefly on the strength of Bingham's arguments, it is indeed anomalous that \u00a7 1983 will provide relief only when a local government, not the State itself, seizes private property. See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 54; <i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> 427 U. S. 445, 452 (1976); <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 674-677 (1974).</p>\n\n</div>",

Bernard Richland.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 in July 1971.<sup>[1]</sup> The gravamen of the complaint was that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*661</span> Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.<sup>[2]</sup> Cf. <i>Cleveland Board of Education</i> v. <i>LaFleur,</i> 414 U. S. 632 (1974). The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave. Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor. In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1415269\"><a href=\"/opinion/1415269/monell-v-department-of-soc-servs-of-city-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 855 (1975). No one now challenges this conclusion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*662</span> The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <i>LaFleur, supra.</i> 394 F. Supp., at 855. Nonetheless plaintiffs' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to \"circumven[t]\" the immunity conferred on municipalities by <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961). See 394 F. Supp., at 855.</p>\n<p>On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education<sup>[4]</sup> was not a \"municipality\" within the meaning of <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape, supra</i><i>,</i> and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions. The court first held that the Board of Education was not a \"person\" under \u00a7 1983 because \"it performs a vital governmental function . . ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent . . ., it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.\" 532 F. 2d 259, 263 (1976). The individual defendants, however, were \"persons\" under \u00a7 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities. 532 F. 2d, at 264. Yet, because a damages award would \"have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i>\" a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed. <i>Id.,</i> at 265.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071, to consider</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are `persons' within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?\" Pet. for Cert. 8. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*663</span> Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under \u00a7 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board<sup>[5]</sup>\u0097and, indeed, in some of which \u00a7 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343, provided the only basis for jurisdiction<sup>[6]</sup>\u0097we indicated in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Education</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided \"another day.\" That other day has come and we now overrule <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape, supra</i><i>,</i> insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under \u00a7 1983.<sup>[7]</sup></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> we held that \"Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [\u00a7 1983].\" 365 U. S., at 187. The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress' rejection of the \"Sherman amendment\" to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor of \u00a7 1983. The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by <i>private</i> persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe). Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend \u00a7 1 of the Act, which is now \u00a7 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by \u00a7 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <i>Monroe</i> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of \u00a7 1 because \"`the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any <i>obligation</i> upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.'\" 365 U. S., at 190 (emphasis added), quoting Globe 804 (Rep. Poland). This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its \"constitutional power . . . to impose <i>civil liability</i> on municipalities,\" 365 U. S., at 190 (emphasis added), and that such doubt would have extended to any type of civil liability.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <i>Monroe</i> incorrectly equated the \"obligation\" of which Representative Poland spoke with \"civil liability.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. An Overview</h2>\n<p>There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871. On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill \"to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.\" H. R. 320 contained four sections. Section 1, now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.<sup>[10]</sup> Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the \"other purpose\" of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.<sup>[11]</sup> The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections\u0097not \u00a7 1, now \u00a7 1983\u0097were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended. The House finished its initial debates on H. R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.<sup>[12]</sup> Again, debate on \u00a7 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*666</span> Immediately prior to the vote on H. R. 320 in the Senate, Senator Sherman introduced his amendment.<sup>[13]</sup> This was <i>not</i> an amendment to \u00a7 1 of the bill, but was to be added as \u00a7 7 at the end of the bill. Under the Senate rules, no discussion of the amendment was allowed and, although attempts were made to amend the amendment, it was passed as introduced. In this form, the amendment did <i>not</i> place liability on municipal corporations, but made any inhabitant of a municipality liable for damage inflicted by persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The House refused to acquiesce in a number of amendments made by the Senate, including the Sherman amendment, and the respective versions of H. R. 320 were therefore sent to a conference committee. Section 1 of the bill, however, was not a subject of this conference since, as noted, it was passed verbatim as introduced in both Houses of Congress.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 1871, the first conference committee completed its work on H. R. 320. The main features of the conference committee draft of the Sherman amendment were these:<sup>[15]</sup> First, a cause of action was given to persons injured by</p>\n<blockquote>\"any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together . . . with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude . . . .\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> Second, the bill provided that the action would be against the county, city, or parish in which the riot had occurred and that it could be maintained by either the person injured or his legal representative. Third, unlike the amendment as proposed, the conference substitute made the government defendant liable on the judgment if it was not satisfied against individual defendants who had committed the violence. If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property \"responsible\" for Ku Klux Klan damage.<sup>[16]</sup> Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.<sup>[17]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*668</span> Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House. House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported \u00a7 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters. And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform. This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <i>Monroe.</i><sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report. The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made \"any person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*669</span> or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,\" who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.<sup>[20]</sup> The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1986.</p>\n<p>The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee. This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment\u0097on which our holding in <i>Monroe</i> was based, see <i>supra,</i> at 664\u0097would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights. Because \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret \u00a7 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the \"persons\" to whom that section applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Debate on the First Conference Report</h2>\n<p>The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States. Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality. Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on \u00a7 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes \"in the States,\" had also raised questions of federal power. The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*670</span> Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that \"there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.\" Globe App. 67. There were analogies, however. With respect to the meaning of \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its Privileges or Immunities Clause, Shellabarger relied on the statement of Mr. Justice Washington in <i>Corfield</i> v. <i>Coryell,</i> 4 Wash. C. C. 371 (CC ED Pa. 1825), which defined the privileges protected by Art. IV:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`What these fundamental privileges are[,] it would perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may, however, be all comprehended under the following general heads: protection by the Government;'\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>\"Mark that</i>\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`<i>protection by the Government;</i> the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety . . . .'\" Globe App. 69 (emphasis added), quoting 4 Wash. C. C., at 380-381.</blockquote>\n<p>Building on his conclusion that citizens were owed protection\u0097a conclusion not disputed by opponents of the Sherman amendment<sup>[21]</sup>\u0097Shellabarger then considered Congress' role in providing that protection. Here again there were precedents:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Congress has always] assumed to enforce, as against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*671</span> the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions of the Constitution. Most of the provisions of the Constitution which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in [Art. I, \u00a7 10,] relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments.. . . These prohibitions upon political powers of the States are all of such nature that they can be, and even have been, . . . enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers. Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States `enforced' these provisions of the Constitution. But there are some that are not of this class. These are where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"These three are: first, that as to fugitives from justice;<sup>[22]</sup> second, that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;)<sup>[23]</sup> third, that declaring that the `citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.'<sup>[24]</sup></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*672</span> \"And, sir, every one of these\u0097the only provisions where it was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the constitutional provisions\u0097the only three where the rights or liabilities of persons in the States, as between these persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect . . . such persons.\" Globe App. 69-70.</blockquote>\n<p>Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV\u0097the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302\u0097the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in <i>Prigg</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania,</i> 16 Pet. 539. There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found. 16 Pet., at 612. Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation. <i>Id.,</i> at 614. Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right and this in turn required a remedy, Story held it to be a \"natural inference\" that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right. <i>Id.,</i> at 615.</p>\n<p>Building on <i>Prigg,</i> Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate\u0097and hence constitutional\u0097method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen's federal right.<sup>[25]</sup> This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot.<sup>[26]</sup> Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*673</span> was \"whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, <i>any obligations to keep the peace</i> in obedience to United States laws.\"<sup>[27]</sup> This he answered affirmatively, citing <i>Board of Comm'rs</i> v. <i>Aspinwall,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span> (1861), the first of many cases<sup>[28]</sup> upholding the power of federal courts to enforce the Contract Clause against municipalities.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>House opponents of the Sherman amendment\u0097whose views are particularly important since only the House voted down the amendment\u0097did not dispute Shellabarger's claim that the Fourteenth Amendment created a federal right to protection, see n. 21, <i>supra,</i> but they argued that the local units of government upon which the amendment fastened liability were not obligated to keep the peace at state law and further that the Federal Government could not constitutionally require local governments to create police forces, whether this requirement was levied directly, or indirectly by imposing damages for breach of the peace on municipalities. The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair:<sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\"The proposition known as the Sherman amendment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*674</span>. . . is entirely new. It is altogether without a precedent in this country. . . . That amendment claims the power in the General Government to go into the States of this Union and lay such obligations as it may please upon the municipalities, which are the creations of the States alone. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\". . . [H]ere it is proposed, not to carry into effect an obligation which rests upon the municipality, but to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*675</span> create that obligation, and that is the provision I am unable to assent to. The parallel of the hundred does not in the least meet the case. The power that laid the obligation upon the hundred first put the duty upon the hundred that it should perform in that regard, and failing to meet the obligation which had been laid upon it, it was very proper that it should suffer damage for its neglect. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"... [T]here are certain rights and duties that belong to the States, . . . there are certain powers that inhere in the State governments. They create these municipalities, they say what their powers shall be and what their obligations shall be. If the Government of the United States can step in and add to those obligations, may it not utterly destroy the municipality? If it can say that it shall be liable for damages occurring from a riot, . . . where [will] its power . . . stop and what obligations . . . might [it] not lay upon a municipality. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Now, only the other day, the Supreme Court . . . decided [in <i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88308\"><a href=\"/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span> (1871)] that there is no power in the Government of the United States, under its authority to tax, to tax the salary of a State officer. Why? Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect. It was held also in the case of Prigg <i>vs.</i> Pennsylvania [16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask . . . the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty.\" Globe 795.</blockquote>\n<p>Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught <span class=\"star-pagination\">*676</span> with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment. Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair's analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <i>Monroe,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.<sup>[31]</sup> Second, Blair's exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent\u0097albeit precedent that has not survived, see <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); <i>Graves</i> v. <i>New York ex rel. O'Keefe,</i> 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939)\u0097and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.</p>\n<p><i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day</i><i>,</i> cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives. There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were \"subject to the control of another and distinct government.\" 11 Wall., at 127. Although the Court in <i>Day</i> apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing \"power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax,\" <i>id.,</i> at 125-126; cf. <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span> (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.<sup>[32]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*677</span> In <i>Prigg</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i><i>,</i> for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see <i>supra,</i> at 672, held that Congress could not \"insist that states . . . provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government.\" 16 Pet., at 615-616.<sup>[33]</sup> And Mr. Justice McLean agreed that, \"[a]s a general principle,\" it was true \"that Congress had no power to impose duties on state officers, as provided in the [Act of Feb. 12, 1793].\" Nonetheless he wondered whether Congress might not impose \"positive\" duties on state officers where a clause of the Constitution, like the Fugitive Slave Clause, seemed to require affirmative government assistance, rather than restraint of government, to secure federal rights. See <i>id.,</i> at 664-665.</p>\n<p>Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by \"positive\" action the protection<sup>[34]</sup> owed individuals under \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep the peace. However, any such argument, largely foreclosed by <i>Prigg,</i> was made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*678</span> impossible by the Court's holding in <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>Dennison,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span> (1861). There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by \u00a7 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793,<sup>[35]</sup> which implemented Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution. Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.\" 24 How., at 107-108.</blockquote>\n<p>The rationale of <i>Dennison</i>\u0097that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities\u0097is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in <i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day</i><i>.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 676. And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties. Although no one cited <i>Dennison</i> by name, the principle for which it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*679</span> stands was well known to Members of Congress,<sup>[36]</sup> many of whom discussed <i>Day</i><sup>[37]</sup> as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases<sup>[38]</sup> in the mid-1860's which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.<sup>[39]</sup> Thus, there was ample support for Blair's view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson's choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to \"destroy the government of the States.\" Globe 795.</p>\n<p>If municipal liability under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson's choice, we might conclude, as <i>Monroe</i> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the \"persons\" to which that section applied. But this is not the case.</p>\n<p>First, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*680</span> liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution\u0097which is as far as \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act went:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I presume . . . that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality . . . an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction. But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever.\" Globe 794.</blockquote>\n<p>Representative Burchard agreed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]here is no duty imposed by the Constitution of the United States, or usually by State laws, upon a county to protect the people of that county against the commission of the offenses herein enumerated, such as the burning of buildings or any other injury to property or injury to person. Police powers are not conferred upon counties as corporations; they are conferred upon cities that have qualified legislative power. And so far as cities are concerned, where the equal protection required to be afforded by a State is imposed upon a city by State laws, perhaps the United States courts could enforce its performance. But counties . . . do not have any control of the police . . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 795.</blockquote>\n<p>See also the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at n. 30, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it. Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <i>Prigg,</i> this is quite understandable. So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the \"positive\" government action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*681</span> required to protect federal constitutional rights and no question was raised of enlisting the States in \"positive\" action. The limits of the principles announced in <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day</i> are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history. It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered <i>Day</i> also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalities\u0097an enforcement effort which included various forms of \"positive\" relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found.<sup>[40]</sup> Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution's express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in <i>Dennison</i> or <i>Day,</i> have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary. Since \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0097a situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against municipalities\u0097there <span class=\"star-pagination\">*682</span> is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to \u00a7 1 suits against municipalities.</p>\n<p>Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment but who had voted for \u00a7 1, confirm that the liability imposed by \u00a7 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment. Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal <i>officials</i> who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law.<sup>[41]</sup> However, for <i>Prigg-Dennison-Day</i> purposes, as Blair and others recognized,<sup>[42]</sup> there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agents\u0097including corporate agents\u0097of the State: Both were state instrumentalities and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power. <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day,</i> after all, were not suits against municipalities but against <i>officers,</i> and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations.<sup>[43]</sup> Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of \u00a7 1\u0097<i>inter alia,</i> complaining that it would be applied to state officers, see Globe App. 217\u0097and who opposed both \u00a7 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on <i>Prigg</i> grounds, agreed unequivocally that \u00a7 1 was constitutional.<sup>[44]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*683</span> Those who voted for \u00a7 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite <i>Prigg, Dennison,</i> and <i>Day.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Bill</h2>\n<p>From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under \u00a7 1\u0097\"any person\"\u0097covers more than natural persons. An examination of the debate on \u00a7 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that \u00a7 1 was intended to cover legal as well as natural persons.</p>\n<p>Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship.\" Globe App. 68.</blockquote>\n<p>By extending a remedy to all people, including whites, \u00a7 1 went beyond the mischief to which the remaining sections of the 1871 Act were addressed. Representative Shellabarger also stated without reservation that the constitutionality of \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 controlled the constitutionality of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act, and that the former had been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*684</span> approved by \"the supreme courts of at least three States of this Union\" and by Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting on circuit, who had concluded: \"`We have no doubt of the constitutionality of every provision of this act.'\" Globe App. 68. Representative Shellabarger then went on to describe how the courts would and should interpret \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed. It would be most strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the rule of interpretation. As has been again and again decided by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and everywhere else where there is wise judicial interpretation, the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is uniformly given in construing such statutes and constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people. . . . Chief Justice Jay and also Story say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"`Where a power is remedial in its nature there is much reason to contend that it ought to be construed liberally, and it is generally adopted in the interpretation of laws.'\u00971 <i>Story on Constitution,</i> sec. 429.\" Globe App., at 68.</blockquote>\n<p>The sentiments expressed in Representative Shellabarger's opening speech were echoed by Senator Edmunds, the manager of H. R. 320 in the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The first section is one that I believe nobody objects to, as defining the rights secured by the Constitution of the United States when they are assailed by any State law or under color of any State law, and it is merely carrying out the principles of the civil rights bill [of 1866], which have since become a part of the Constitution.\" Globe 568.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*685</span> \"[Section 1 is] so very simple and really re\u00ebnact[s] the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 569.</blockquote>\n<p>And he agreed that the bill \"secure[d] the rights of white men as much as of colored men.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 696.</p>\n<p>In both Houses, statements of the supporters of \u00a7 1 corroborated that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected civil rights.<sup>[45]</sup> Moreover, since municipalities through their official <span class=\"star-pagination\">*686</span> acts could, equally with natural persons, create the harms intended to be remedied by \u00a7 1, and, further, since Congress intended \u00a7 1 to be broadly construed, there is no reason to suppose that municipal corporations would have been excluded from the sweep of \u00a7 1. Cf., <i>e. g., </i><i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880); <i>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles,</i> 227 U. S. 278, 286-287, 294-296 (1913). One need not rely on this inference alone, however, for the debates show that Members of Congress understood \"persons\" to include municipal corporations.</p>\n<p>Representative Bingham, for example, in discussing \u00a7 1 of the bill, explained that he had drafted \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with the case of <i>Barron</i> v. <i>Mayor of Baltimore,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span> (1833), especially in mind. \"In [that] case the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*687</span> <i>city</i> had taken private property for public use, without compensation. . ., and there was no redress for the wrong . . . .\" Globe App. 84 (emphasis added). Bingham's further remarks clearly indicate his view that such takings by cities, as had occurred in <i>Barron,</i> would be redressable under \u00a7 1 of the bill. See Globe App. 85. More generally, and as Bingham's remarks confirm, \u00a7 1 of the bill would logically be the vehicle by which Congress provided redress for takings, since that section provided the only civil remedy for Fourteenth Amendment violations and that Amendment unequivocally prohibited uncompensated takings.<sup>[46]</sup> Given this purpose, it beggars reason to suppose that Congress would have exempted municipalities from suit, insisting instead that compensation for a taking come from an officer in his individual capacity rather than from the government unit that had the benefit of the property taken.<sup>[47]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis. This had not always been so. When this Court first considered the question of the status of corporations, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, denied that corporations \"as such\" were persons as that term was used in Art. III and the Judiciary Act of 1789. See <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809).<sup>[48]</sup> By 1844, however, the <i>Deveaux</i> doctrine was unhesitatingly abandoned:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] corporation created by and doing business in a particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*688</span> state, is to be deemed <i>to all intents and purposes as a person,</i> although an artificial person, . . . capable of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural person.\" <i>Louisville R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span>, 558 (1844) (emphasis added), discussed in Globe 752.</blockquote>\n<p>And only two years before the debates on the Civil Rights Act, in <i>Cowles</i> v. <i>Mercer County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87989\"><a href=\"/opinion/87989/cowles-v-mercer-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 121 (1869), the <i>Letson</i> principle was automatically and without discussion extended to municipal corporations. Under this doctrine, municipal corporations were routinely sued in the federal courts<sup>[49]</sup> and this fact was well known to Members of Congress.<sup>[50]</sup></p>\n<p>That the \"usual\" meaning of the word \"person\" would extend to municipal corporations is also evidenced by an Act of Congress which had been passed only months before the Civil Rights Act was passed. This Act provided that</p>\n<blockquote>\"in all acts hereafter passed . . . the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense.\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.</blockquote>\n<p>Municipal corporations in 1871 were included within the phrase \"bodies politic and corporate\"<sup>[51]</sup> and, accordingly, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*689</span> \"plain meaning\" of \u00a7 1 is that local government bodies were to be included within the ambit of the persons who could be sued under \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act. Indeed, a Circuit Judge, writing in 1873 in what is apparently the first reported case under \u00a7 1, read the Dictionary Act in precisely this way in a case involving a corporate plaintiff and a municipal defendant.<sup>[52]</sup> See <i>Northwestern Fertilizing Co.</i> v. <i>Hyde Park,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span>, 394 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873).<sup>[53]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> II</h2>\n<p>Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress <i>did</i> intend municipalities and other local government units to be included among those persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies.<sup>[54]</sup> Local governing bodies,<sup>[55]</sup> therefore, can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers. Moreover, although the touchstone of the \u00a7 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other \u00a7 1983 \"person,\" by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \"custom\" even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body's official decisionmaking channels. As Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said in <i>Adickes</i> v. <i>S. H. Kress &amp; Co.,</i> 398 U. S. 144, 167-168 (1970): \"Congress included customs and usages [in \u00a7 1983] because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials . . . . Although not authorized by written law, such practices of state officials could well be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a `custom or usage' with the force of law.\"<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, the language of \u00a7 1983, read against the background of the same legislative history, compels the conclusion that Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort. In particular, we conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable <i>solely</i> because it employs a tortfeasor\u0097or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a <i>respondeat superior</i> theory.</p>\n<p>We begin with the language of \u00a7 1983 as originally passed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[<i>A</i>]<i>ny person who,</i> under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, <i>shall subject, or cause to be subjected,</i> any person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*692</span> law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\" 17 Stat. 13 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The italicized language plainly imposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, \"causes\" an employee to violate another's constitutional rights. At the same time, that language cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor. Indeed, the fact that Congress did specifically provide that A's tort became B's liability if B \"caused\" A to subject another to a tort suggests that Congress did not intend \u00a7 1983 liability to attach where such causation was absent.<sup>[57]</sup> See <i>Rizzo</i> v. <i>Goode,</i> 423 U. S. 362, 370-371 (1976).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> Equally important, creation of a federal law of <i>respondeat superior</i> would have raised all the constitutional problems associated with the obligation to keep the peace, an obligation Congress chose not to impose because it thought imposition of such an obligation unconstitutional. To this day, there is disagreement about the basis for imposing liability on an employer for the torts of an employee when the sole nexus between the employer and the tort is the fact of the employer-employee relationship. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 69, p. 459 (4th ed. 1971). Nonetheless, two justifications tend to stand out. First is the common-sense notion that no matter how blameless an employer appears to be in an individual case, accidents might nonetheless be reduced if employers had to bear the cost of accidents. See, <i>e. g., ibid.;</i> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 26.3, pp. 1368-1369 (1956). Second is the argument that the cost of accidents should be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*694</span> spread to the community as a whole on an insurance theory. See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> \u00a7 26.5; Prosser, <i>supra,</i> at 459.<sup>[58]</sup></p>\n<p>The first justification is of the same sort that was offered for statutes like the Sherman amendment: \"The obligation to make compensation for injury resulting from riot is, by arbitrary enactment of statutes, affirmatory law, and the reason of passing the statute is to secure a more perfect police regulation.\" Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen). This justification was obviously insufficient to sustain the amendment against perceived constitutional difficulties and there is no reason to suppose that a more general liability imposed for a similar reason would have been thought less constitutionally objectionable. The second justification was similarly put forward as a justification for the Sherman amendment: \"we do not look upon [the Sherman amendment] as a punishment. . . . It is a mutual insurance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). Again, this justification was insufficient to sustain the amendment.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983. Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see <i>supra,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*695</span> 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below. In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 may be. We have attempted only to sketch so much of the \u00a7 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although we have stated that <i>stare decisis</i> has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 671, and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied <i>stare decisis</i> mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Continental T. V., Inc.</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Nor is this a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\" <i>Girouard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).</p>\n<p>First, <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under \u00a7 1983, was a departure from prior practice. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Northwestern Fertilizing Co.</i> v. <i>Hyde Park,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span> (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); <i>City of Manchester</i> v. <i>Leiby,</i> 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); <i>Hannan</i> v. <i>City of Haverhill,</i> 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>City of Jeannette,</i> 319 U. S. 157 (1943); <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in \u00a7 1983 suits.<sup>[59]</sup> Moreover, the constitutional defect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*696</span> that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration. See <i>supra,</i> at 673-682. For this reason, our cases\u0097decided both before and after <i>Monroe,</i> see n. 5, <i>supra</i>\u0097 holding school boards liable in \u00a7 1983 actions are inconsistent with <i>Monroe,</i> especially as <i>Monroe's</i> immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973).<sup>[60]</sup> And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not \"disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.\" <i>Brown Shoe Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (\"Those decisions are not cited as authority . . . but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench\"). Thus, while we have reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i> without further examination on three occasions,<sup>[61]</sup> it can scarcely be said that <i>Monroe</i> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.</p>\n<p>Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards. Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent. In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.<sup>[62]</sup> Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often <span class=\"star-pagination\">*697</span> defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been \u00a7 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.<sup>[63]</sup> Finally, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*698</span> regard to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in \u00a7 1983 suits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*699</span> to obtain attorney's fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local <i>bodies</i> or State or local officials. In such cases it is intended that the attorneys' fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, <i>in his official capacity,</i> from funds of his agency or under his control, or <i>from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).\"</i> S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Far from showing that Congress has relied on <i>Monroe,</i> therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <i>Monroe</i> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though <i>Monroe, City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> and <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.<sup>[64]</sup></p>\n<p>Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can <span class=\"star-pagination\">*700</span> support an absolute immunity. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <i>Monroe,</i> \"[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.\" 365 U. S., at 221-222 (dissenting in part). Indeed, municipalities simply cannot \"arrange their affairs\" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under \u00a7 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement. And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <i>Monroe</i> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.</p>\n<p>Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <i>Monroe</i><sup>[65]</sup>\u0097\"that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that <i>[Monroe]</i> misapprehended the meaning of the [section],\" 365 U. S., at 192 (concurring opinion)\u0097the overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it holds that local governments are not \"persons\" who may be defendants in \u00a7 1983 suits is clearly proper. It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress' view of the law, were \u00a7 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers. Yet everyone\u0097proponents and opponents alike\u0097knew \u00a7 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that \u00a7 1983 was constitutional. See <i>supra,</i> at 680-682. And, moreover, there can be no doubt that \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*701</span> rights. Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that \u00a7 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation\u0097which simply is not present\u0097there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the \"persons\" covered by \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that <i>stare decisis</i> does not bar our overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.<sup>[66]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under \u00a7 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 \"be drained of meaning,\" <i>Scheuer</i> v. <i>Rhodes,</i> 416 U. S. 232, 248 (1974). Cf. <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U. S. 388, 397-398 (1971).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*702</span> V</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p>As proposed, the Sherman amendment was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; and if such offense was committed to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the inhabitants of the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered by such person or his representative by a suit in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish.

JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court, and express these additional views.</p>\n<p>Few cases in the history of the Court have been cited more frequently than <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961), decided less than two decades ago. Focusing new light on 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*705</span> the 1871 measure. But <i>Monroe</i> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entities\u0097even when they act pursuant to express authorization. The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <i>Monroe</i> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court's opinion today. Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law,<sup>[1]</sup> the <i>Monroe</i> Court treated the 42d Congress' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury. That reading, in light of today's thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision,\" <i>Monroe, supra,</i> at 192 (Harlan, J., concurring). In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*706</span> with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. <i>Cleveland Board of Education</i> v. <i>LaFleur,</i> 414 U. S. 632 (1974), the Court decides \"not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late,\" <i>Henslee</i> v. <i>Union Planters Bank,</i> 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of \"riot act\" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness. As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 legislation\u0097now \u00a7 1983\u0097that \"any person\" acting \"under color of\" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that \"subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person . . . to the deprivation of any\" federal constitutional or statutory right. Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports <i>Monroe</i>'s observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally \"antagonistic,\" 365 U. S., at 191, to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation. Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal's unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of \u00a7 1983 judgment lienors. <i>Ante,</i> at 673-674, n. 30. The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment's attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces. <i>Ante,</i> at 673-675, 679-682.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*707</span> The Court correctly rejects a view of the legislative history that would produce the anomalous result of immunizing local government units from monetary liability for action directly causing a constitutional deprivation, even though such actions may be fully consistent with, and thus not remediable under, state law. No conduct of government comes more clearly within the \"under color of\" state law language of \u00a7 1983. It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be <i>exclusively</i> liable for resulting constitutional injury.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>As elaborated in Part II of today's opinion, the rejection of the Sherman amendment can best be understood not as evidence of Congress' acceptance of a rule of absolute municipal immunity but as a limitation of the statutory ambit to actual wrongdoers, <i>i. e.,</i> a rejection of <i>respondeat superior</i> or any other principle of vicarious liability. Cf. Levin, The Section 1983 Municipal Immunity Doctrine, 65 Geo. L. J. 1483, 1531-1535 (1977). Thus, it has been clear that a public official may be held liable in damages when his actions are found to violate a constitutional right and there is no qualified immunity, see <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Strickland,</i> 420 U. S. 308 (1975); <i>Procunier</i> v. <i>Navarette,</i> 434 U. S. 555 (1978). Today the Court recognizes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*708</span> that this principle also applies to a local government when implementation of its official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court traditionally has been hesitant to overrule prior constructions of statutes or interpretations of common-law rules. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy,\" <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but this cautionary principle must give way to countervailing considerations in appropriate circumstances.<sup>[4]</sup> I concur in the Court's view that this is not a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\" <i>Girouard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).</p>\n<p>Nor is this the usual case in which the Court is asked to overrule a precedent. Here considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> cut in both directions. On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983. On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to \u00a7 1983 suits.</p>\n<p>In <i>Monroe</i> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court\u0097 whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies. \"The theory of the complaint [in <i>Monroe</i> was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of <i>respondeat superior.</i>\" Brief for Petitioners, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*709</span> O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 21.<sup>[5]</sup> Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners' position would expose \"Chicago and every other municipality in the United States . . . to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of.\" Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 26. Thus the ground of decision in <i>Monroe</i> was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*710</span> Similarly, in <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973), petitioners asserted that \"the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff,\" <i>id.,</i> at 696, under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988. In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, 411 U. S., at 710, and n. 27, we reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i>'s reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to \"the holding in <i>Monroe</i> concerning the status under \u00a7 1983 of public entities such as the County,\" 411 U. S., at 700; Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.</p>\n<p>Only in <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973), did the Court confront a \u00a7 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury. In <i>Kenosha,</i> however, we raised the issue of the city's amenability to suit under \u00a7 1983 on our own initiative.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>This line of cases\u0097from <i>Monroe</i> to <i>Kenosha</i>\u0097is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*711</span> in which the Court has assumed <i>sub silentio</i> that some local government entities could be sued under \u00a7 1983. If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <i>Monroe,</i> grave doubt would be cast upon the Court's exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards. See <i>ante,</i> at 663 n. 5. Since \"the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards,\" <i>ante,</i> at 696, the conflict is squarely presented. Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Green</i> v. <i>County School Board,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 437-439, 441-442 (1968); <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S. 267, 292-293 (1977) (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment). And, as the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court's school board decisions in several statutes. Thus the exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding. Indeed, it predated <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which \"may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \u00a7 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908),\" <i>post,</i> at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents. At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief. <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Chesterfield County School Board,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460310\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460310/cohen-v-chesterfield-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev'd, 474 F. 2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, 414 U. S. 632 (1974); <i>Tinker</i> v. <i>Des Moines Independent School Dist.,</i> 393 U. S. 503, 504 (1969). See also <i>Vlandis</i> v. <i>Kline,</i> 412 U. S. 441, 445 (1973). Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*712</span> for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable. Cf. <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651 (1974).<sup>[8]</sup> Moreover, the rationale of <i>Kenosha</i> would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under \u00a7 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government. The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of <i>Ex parte Young</i> into \u00a7 1983, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266 (CA2 1976). That approach, however, would create tension with <i>Kenosha</i> because it would require \"a bifurcated application\" of \"the generic word `person' in \u00a7 1983\" to public officials \"depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\" 412 U. S., at 513. A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a \"person\" for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-\"person\" in an action for damages. The Court's holding avoids this difficulty. See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 55.</p>\n<p>Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under \u00a7 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether \"we should, by analogy to our decision in <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U. S. 388 (1971), imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in \u00a7 1983 . . . .\" <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 278 (1977). One aspect of that inquiry would be whether there are any \"special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\" <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U. S. 388, 396 (1971), such as an \"explicit congressional declaration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*713</span> that persons injured by a [municipality] may not recover money damages . . ., but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the view of Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 397. In light of the Court's persuasive re-examination in today's decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from \u00a7 1983 \"an explicit congressional declaration\" against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution. Rather than constitutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Difficult questions nevertheless remain for another day. There are substantial line-drawing problems in determining \"when execution of a government's policy or custom\" can be said to inflict constitutional injury such that \"government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 694. This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board; it is the clear case. The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity. <i>Ante,</i> at 701. Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see <i>post,</i> at 720-721, or other principles support a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*714</span> qualified municipal immunity in the context of the \u00a7 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part.</p>\n<p>Since Parts II and IV of the opinion of the Court are merely advisory and are not necessary to explain the Court's decision, I join only Parts I, III, and V.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years ago, in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a \"person\" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983. Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions. <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973). See also <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 277-279 (1977). Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961. Because I cannot agree that this Court is \"free to disregard these precedents,\" which have been \"considered maturely and recently\" by this Court, <i>Runyon</i> v. <i>McCrary,</i> 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As this Court has repeatedly recognized, <i>id.,</i> at 175 n. 12; <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation. In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court's settled construction of the law, but the Congress is at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*715</span> liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit. The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. . . . This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.\" <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406-407 (1932) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Only the most compelling circumstances can justify this Court's abandonment of such firmly established statutory precedents. The best exposition of the proper burden of persuasion was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan in <i>Monroe</i> itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\"From my point of view, the policy of <i>stare decisis,</i> as it should be applied in matters of statutory construction, and, to a lesser extent, the indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation, require that it appear <i>beyond doubt</i> from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>United States</i> v.] <i>Classic,</i> [313 U. S. 299 (1941)] and <i>Screws</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> 325 U. S. 91 (1945)] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision, before a departure from what was decided in those cases would be justified.\" 365 U. S., at 192 (concurring opinion) (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court does not demonstrate that any exception to this general rule is properly applicable here. The Court's first assertion, that <i>Monroe</i> \"was a departure from prior practice,\" <i>ante,</i> at 695, is patently erroneous. Neither in <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>City of Jeannette,</i> 319 U. S. 157 (1943), nor in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*716</span> 350 U. S. 879 (1955), nor in any of the school board cases cited by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 663 n. 5, was the question now before us raised by any of the litigants or addressed by this Court. As recently as four Terms ago, we said in <i>Hagans</i> v. <i>Lavine,</i> 415 U. S. 528, 535 n. 5 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions <i>sub silentio,</i> this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The source of this doctrine that jurisdictional issues decided <i>sub silentio</i> are not binding in other cases seems to be Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's remark in <i>United States</i> v. <i>More,</i> 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805).<sup>[1]</sup> While the Chief Justice also said that such decisions may \"have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench,\" <i>Bank of the </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809), unconsidered assumptions of jurisdiction simply cannot outweigh four consistent decisions of this Court, explicitly considering and rejecting that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any indication that any later Congress has ever approved suit against any municipal corporation under \u00a7 1983. Of all its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, \u00a7 2, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871.<sup>[2]</sup> The 1976 Act provides that attorney's fees may be awarded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*717</span> to the prevailing party \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title.\" There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections; it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney's fees. As the Court admits, <i>ante,</i> at 699, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed \"whether or not the agency or government is a named party,\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well-known holding of <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's assertion that municipalities have no right to act \"on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely,\" <i>ante,</i> at 700, is simply beside the point. Since <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights. No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of <i>stare decisis.</i> To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL's view that \"[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6. Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being <span class=\"star-pagination\">*718</span> obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind. To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), forward, in which the explicit ground of decision \"was never actually briefed or argued,\" <i>ante,</i> at 708 (POWELL, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law. Indeed, in <i>Marbury</i> itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicants\u0097which, unlike the arguments in <i>Monroe,</i> is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see it\u0097devotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress. Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance. 1 Cranch, at 153-154. More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother POWELL'S analysis. In <i>Mapp</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 367 U. S. 643 (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule <i>Wolf</i> v. <i>Colorado,</i> 338 U. S. 25 (1949); it did so only at the request of an <i>amicus curiae.</i> 367 U. S., at 646 n. 3. That <i>Marbury, Mapp,</i> and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary byproduct of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present \"all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6 (POWELL, J., concurring). While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress. That intent was first expounded in <i>Monroe,</i> and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*719</span> has been followed consistently ever since. This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference. Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <i>Monroe.</i> 124 Cong. Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978). In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of <i>stare decisis</i> require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings. <i>Monroe</i> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated \"beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>Monroe</i>] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\" <i>Monroe,</i> 365 U. S., at 192 (Harlan, J., concurring). The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting \u00a7 1, it intended to impose that liability. I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Any analysis of the meaning of the word \"person\" in \u00a7 1983, which was originally enacted as \u00a7 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act. The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"That in all acts hereafter passed . . . the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense . . . .\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.</blockquote>\n<p>The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word \"person\" where the context suggests a more limited reach. Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*720</span> in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person. Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act's provision that \"words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females,\" might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).</p>\n<p>There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted \u00a7 1983 may well have intended the word \"person\" \"to be used in a more limited sense,\" as <i>Monroe</i> concluded. It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, <i>Louisville R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span>, 558 (1844), and municipal corporations, <i>Cowles</i> v. <i>Mercer County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87989\"><a href=\"/opinion/87989/cowles-v-mercer-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 121 (1869), were \"citizens\" of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III. Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court, in <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88079\"><a href=\"/opinion/88079/paul-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span> (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be \"citizens\" within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 2. Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts. Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that \u00a7 1 \"was so very simple and really reenact[ed] the Constitution.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds). At the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a \"citizen\" nor a \"person.\" <i>Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>New Orleans,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span> (No. 7,052) (CC La. 1870).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the state courts did not speak with a single voice with regard to the tort liability of municipal corporations. Although many Members of Congress represented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*721</span> States which had retained absolute municipal tort immunity, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Irvine</i> v. <i>Town of Greenwood,</i> 89 S. C. 511, 72 S. E. 228 (1911) (collecting earlier cases), other States had adopted the currently predominant distinction imposing liability for proprietary acts, see generally 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts \u00a7 29.6 (1956), as early as 1842, <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Mayor of City of New York,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Hill</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span> (N. Y. 1842). Nevertheless, no state court had ever held that municipal corporations were always liable in tort in precisely the same manner as other persons.</p>\n<p>The general remarks from the floor on the liberal purposes of \u00a7 1 offer no explicit guidance as to the parties against whom the remedy could be enforced. As the Court concedes, only Representative Bingham raised a concern which could be satisfied only by relief against governmental bodies. Yet he never directly related this concern to \u00a7 1 of the Act. Indeed, Bingham stated at the outset, \"I do not propose now to discuss the provisions of the bill in detail,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 82 (1871), and, true to his word, he launched into an extended discourse on the beneficent purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. While Bingham clearly stated that Congress could \"provide that no citizen in any State shall be deprived of his property by State law or the judgment of a State court without just compensation therefor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 85, he never suggested that such a power was exercised in \u00a7 1.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*722</span> Finally, while Bingham has often been advanced as the chief expositor of the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Duncan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 391 U. S. 145, 165 (1968) (Black, J., concurring); <i>Adamson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 332 U. S. 46, 73-74 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting), there is nothing to indicate that his colleagues placed any greater credence in his theories than has this Court. See <i>Duncan, supra,</i> at 174-176 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <i>Adamson, supra,</i> at 64 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Thus, it ought not lightly to be presumed, as the Court does today, <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 53, that \u00a7 1983 \"should prima facie be construed to include `bodies politic' among the entities that could be sued.\" Neither the Dictionary Act, the ambivalent state of judicial decisions, nor the floor debate on \u00a7 1 of the Act gives any indication that any Member of Congress had any inkling that \u00a7 1 could be used to impose liability on municipalities. Although Senator Thurman, as the Court emphasizes, <i>ante,</i> at 686 n. 45, expressed his belief that the terms of \u00a7 1 \"are as comprehensive as can be used,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871), an examination of his lengthy remarks demonstrates that it never occurred to him that \u00a7 1 did impose or could have imposed any liability upon municipal corporations. In an extended parade of horribles, this \"old Roman,\" who was one of the Act's most implacable opponents, suggested that state legislatures, Members of Congress, and state judges might be held liable under the Act. <i>Ibid.</i> If, at that point in the debate, he had any idea that \u00a7 1 was designed to impose tort liability upon cities and counties, he would surely have raised an additional outraged objection. Only once was that possibility placed squarely before the Congress\u0097in its consideration of the Sherman amendment\u0097and the Congress squarely rejected it.</p>\n<p>The Court is probably correct that the rejection of the Sherman amendment does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Congress intended municipalities to be immune from liability under all circumstances. Nevertheless, it cannot be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*723</span> denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress' understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context. Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can we levy on the court-house and sell it? So this section provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action <i>ex delicto,</i> where the county has never entered into any contract, where the State has never authorized the county to assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability upon it. It is in my opinion simply absurd.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 799 (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).</blockquote>\n<p>Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented. Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended \u00a7 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of \"person,\" and thus the reasoning of <i>Monroe</i> on this point is subject to challenge. The meaning of \u00a7 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <i>Monroe,</i> and it may well be that on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates a conclusion contrary to the <i>Monroe</i> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago. But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*724</span> Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on \u00a7 1 that the word \"person\" was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing \"beyond doubt\" that this Court in <i>Monroe</i> \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\" Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <i>Monroe</i> do not end the inquiry as to <i>stare decisis;</i> they merely begin it. I would adhere to the holding of <i>Monroe</i> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The decision in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years. Using \u00a7 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <i>Monroe</i> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials' failure to predict the course of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence. None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today's removal of that protection. Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today's decision.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Michael H.

See <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507, 517-520 (1973). However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape,</i> 365 U.

Finally, \u00a7 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant. See Cong.

Presumably he assumed that taxes would be levied against the property of the inhabitants to make the locality whole.</p>\n<p>[17]  According to Senator Sherman, the law had originally been adopted in England immediately after the Norman Conquest and had most recently been promulgated as the law of 7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4, ch. 31 (1827). See Globe 760. During the course of the debates, it appeared that Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York had similar laws. See <i>id.,</i> at 751 (Rep. Shellabarger); <i>id.,</i> at 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <i>id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). Such a municipal liability was apparently common throughout New England. See <i>id.,</i> at 761 (Sen. Sherman).</p>\n<p>[18]  In the Senate, opponents, including a number of Senators who had voted for \u00a7 1 of the bill, criticized the Sherman amendment as an imperfect and impolitic rendering of the state statutes. Moreover, as drafted, the conference substitute could be construed to protect rights that were not protected by the Constitution. A complete critique was given by Senator Thurman.

Moreover, \u00a7 2 of the 1871 Act as passed, unlike \u00a7 1, prosecuted persons who violated federal rights whether or not that violation was under color of official authority, apparently on the theory that Ku Klux Klan violence was infringing the right of protection defined by <i>Coryell.</i> Nonetheless, opponents argued that municipalities were not generally charged by the States with keeping the peace and hence did not have police forces, so that the duty to afford protection ought not devolve on the municipality, but on whatever agency of state government was charged by the State with keeping the peace. See <i>infra,</i> at 673, and n. 30. In addition, they argued that Congress could not constitutionally add to the duties of municipalities. See <i>infra,</i> at 673-678.</p>\n<p>[22]  U. S.

Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position: He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection. That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc. He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the <i>States</i> the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated. See <i>id.,</i> at 791.\n</p>\n<p>Opponents of the Sherman amendment in the Senate agreed with Blair that Congress had no power to pass the Sherman amendment because it fell outside limits on national power implicit in the federal structure of the Constitution and recognized in, <i>e. g., </i><i>Collector</i> v. <i>Day,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88308\"><a href=\"/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span> (1871). However, the Senate opponents focused not on the amendment's attempt to obligate municipalities to keep the peace, but on the lien created by the amendment, which ran against <i>all</i> money and property of a defendant municipality, including property held for public purposes, such as jails or courthouses. Opponents argued that such a lien once entered would have the effect of making it impossible for the municipality to function, since no one would trade with it. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Globe 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 763 (Sen. Casserly). Moreover, everyone knew that sound policy prevented execution against public property since this, too, was needed if local government was to survive. See, <i>e. g., ibid.</i> See also <i>Meriwether</i> v. <i>Garrett,</i> 102 U. S. 472, 501, 513 (1880) (recognizing principle that public property of a municipality was not subject to execution); 2 J.

Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *483-*484 (1871 ed.).</p>\n<p>[40]  See cases cited in n. 28, <i>supra.</i> Since this Court granted unquestionably \"positive\" relief in Contract Clause cases, it appears that the distinction between the Sherman amendment and those cases was not that the former created a positive obligation whereas the latter imposed only a negative restraint. Instead, the distinction must have been that a violation of the Constitution was the predicate for \"positive\" relief in the Contract Clause cases, whereas the Sherman amendment imposed damages without regard to whether a local government was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages. See <i>supra,</i> at 668. While no one stated this distinction expressly during the debates, the inference is strong that Congressmen in 1871 would have drawn this distinction since it explains why Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <i>supra,</i> at 680, could oppose the amendment while at the same time saying that the Federal Government might impose damages on a local government that had defaulted in a state-imposed duty to keep the peace, and it also explains why everyone agreed that a state or municipal officer could constitutionally be held liable under \u00a7 1 for violations of the Constitution.

He continued:\n</p>\n<p>\"The States never had the right, though they had the power, to inflict wrongs upon free citizens by a denial of the full protection of the laws . . . .

Mercur).</p>\n<p>Other supporters were quite clear that \u00a7 1 of the Act extended a remedy not only where a State had passed an unconstitutional statute, but also where officers of the State were deliberately indifferent to the rights of black citizens:</p>\n<p>\"But the chief complaint is ... [that] by a systematic maladministration of [state law], or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.

S., at 171-187.</p>\n<p>Importantly for our inquiry, even the opponents of \u00a7 1 agreed that it was constitutional and, further, that it swept very broadly. Thus, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of \u00a7 1, said:</p>\n<p>\"This section relates wholly to civil suits. . . . Its whole effect is to give to the Federal Judiciary that which now does not belong to it\u0097<i>a jurisdiction that may be constitutionally conferred upon it, I grant,</i> but that has never yet been conferred upon it. It authorizes any person who is deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, to bring an action against the wrong-doer in the Federal courts, and that without any limit whatsoever as to the amount in controversy. . . .</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"<i>[T]here is no limitation whatsoever upon the terms that are employed</i> [<i>in the bill</i>], <i>and they are as comprehensive as can be used.</i>\" Globe App. 216-217 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[46]  See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1956 (T.

See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Maurice,</i> 2 Brock. 96, 109 (CC Va. 1823) (Marshall, C. J.) (\"The United States is a government, and, consequently, a body politic and corporate\"); Apps. D and E to Brief for Petitioners in <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Pape</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1960, No. 39 (collecting state statutes which, in 1871, defined municipal corporations as bodies politic and corporate).</p>\n<p>[52]  The court also noted that there was no discernible reason why persons injured by municipal corporations should not be able to recover. See 18 F. Cas., at 394.</p>\n<p>[53]  In considering the effect of the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, in <i>Monroe,</i> however, Mr. Justice Douglas, apparently focusing on the word \"may,\" stated: \"[T]his definition [of person] is merely an allowable, not a mandatory, one.\" 365 U. S., at 191. A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.\n</p>\n<p>There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of \"person,\" but Senator Trumbull, the Act's sponsor, discussed the phrase \"words importing the masculine gender <i>may</i> be applied to. females,\" (emphasis added), which immediately precedes the definition of \"person,\" and stated:</p>\n<p>\"The only object [of the Act] is to get rid of a great deal of verbosity in our statutes by providing that when the word `he' is used it <i>shall</i> include females as well as males.\" Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thus, in Trumbull's view the word \"may\" meant \"shall.\" Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is also required for it to perform its intended function\u0097to be a guide to \"rules of construction\" of Acts of Congress. See <i>ibid.</i> (remarks of Sen. Trumbull). Were the defined words \"allowable, [but] not mandatory\" constructions, as <i>Monroe</i> suggests, there would be no \"rules\" at all. Instead, Congress must have intended the definitions of the Act to apply across-the-board except where the Act by its terms called for a deviation from this practice\u0097\"[where] the context shows that [defined] words were to be used in a more limited sense.\" Certainly this is how the <i>Northwestern Fertilizing</i> court viewed the matter. Since there is nothing in the \"context\" of \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word \"person,\" the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include \"bodies politic\" among the entities that could be sued.</p>\n<p>[54]  There is certainly no constitutional impediment to municipal liability. \"The Tenth Amendment's reservation of nondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal-court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S. 267, 291 (1977); see <i>Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U. S., at 347-348. For this reason, <i>National League of Cities</i> v. <i>Usery,</i> 426 U. S. 833 (1976), is irrelevant to our consideration of this case. Nor is there any basis for concluding that the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to municipal liability. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> 427 U. S. 445, 456 (1976); <i>Lincoln County</i> v. <i>Luning,</i> 133 U. S. 529, 530 (1890). Our holding today is, of course, limited to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p>[55]  Since official-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent\u0097at least where Eleventh Amendment considerations do not control analysis\u0097 our holding today that local governments can be sued under \u00a7 1983 necessarily decides that local government officials sued in their official capacities are \"persons\" under \u00a7 1983 in those cases in which, as here, a local government would be suable in its own name.</p>\n<p>[56]  See also Mr. Justice Frankfurter's statement for the Court in <i>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Browning,</i> 310 U. S. 362, 369 (1940):\n</p>\n<p>\"It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice . . . can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\"</p>\n<p>[57]  Support for such a conclusion can be found in the legislative history. As we have indicated, there is virtually no discussion of \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act. Again, however, Congress' treatment of the Sherman amendment gives a clue to whether it would have desired to impose <i>respondeat superior</i> liability.\n</p>\n<p>The primary constitutional justification for the Sherman amendment was that it was a necessary and proper remedy for the failure of localities to protect citizens as the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required. See <i>supra,</i> at 670-673. And according to Sherman, Shellabarger, and Edmunds, the amendment came into play only when a locality was at fault or had knowingly neglected its duty to provide protection. See Globe 761 (Sen. Sherman); <i>id.,</i> at 756 (Sen. Edmunds); <i>id.,</i> at 751-752 (Rep. Shellabarger). But other proponents of the amendment apparently viewed it as a form of vicarious liability for the unlawful acts of the citizens of the locality. See <i>id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler). And whether intended or not, the amendment as drafted did impose a species of vicarious liability on municipalities since it could be construed to impose liability even if a municipality did not know of an impending or ensuing riot or did not have the wherewithal to do anything about it. Indeed, the amendment held a municipality liable even if it had done everything in its power to curb the riot. See <i>supra,</i> at 668; Globe 761 (Sen. Stevenson); <i>id.,</i> at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <i>id.,</i> at 788 (Rep. Kerr); <i>id.,</i> at 791 (Rep. Willard). While the first conference substitute was rejected principally on constitutional grounds, see <i>id.,</i> at 804 (Rep. Poland), it is plain from the text of the second conference substitute\u0097which limited liability to those who, having the power to intervene against Ku Klux Klan violence, \"neglect[ed] or refuse[d] so to do,\" see Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 704, and which was enacted as \u00a7 6 of the 1871 Act and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1986\u0097that Congress also rejected those elements of vicarious liability contained in the first conference substitute even while accepting the basic principle that the inhabitants of a community were bound to provide protection against the Ku Klux Klan. Strictly speaking, of course, the fact that Congress refused to impose vicarious liability for the wrongs of a few private citizens does not conclusively establish that it would similarly have refused to impose vicarious liability for the torts of a municipality's employees. Nonetheless, when Congress' rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in \u00a7 1983 which can easily be construed to create <i>respondeat superior</i> liability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.</p>\n<p>[58]  A third justification, often cited but which on examination is apparently insufficient to justify the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior,</i> see, <i>e. g.,</i> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, \u00a7 26.3, is that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor. By our decision in <i>Rizzo</i> v. <i>Goode,</i> 423 U. S. 362 (1976), we would appear to have decided that the mere right to control without any control or direction having been exercised and without any failure to supervise is not enough to support \u00a7 1983 liability. See 423 U. S., at 370-371.</p>\n<p>[59]  Each case cited by <i>Monroe,</i> see 365 U. S., at 191 n. 50, as consistent with the position that local governments were not \u00a7 1983 \"persons\" reached its conclusion by assuming that state-law immunities overrode the \u00a7 1983 cause of action. This has never been the law.</p>\n<p>[60]  Although many suits against school boards also include private individuals as parties, the \"principal defendant is usually the local board of education or school board.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S., at 292-293 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>[61]  <i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976).</p>\n<p>[62]  During the heyday of the furor over busing, both the House and the Senate refused to adopt bills that would have removed from the federal courts jurisdiction\n</p>\n<p>\"to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order requiring any <i>school board</i> to make any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any <i>school board</i> to transport any students from one public school to another public school or from one place to another place or from one school district to another school district in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body at any school or place or in any school district, or denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any <i>school board</i> to close any school and transfer the students from the closed school to any other school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body at any public school, or precluding any <i>school board</i> from carrying into effect any provision of any contract between it and any member of the faculty of any public school it operates specifying the public school where the member of the faculty is to perform his or her duties under the contract.\" S. 1737, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 1207 (1973) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Other bills designed either completely to remove the federal courts from the school desegregation controversy, S. 287, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), or to limit the ability of federal courts to subject school boards to remedial orders in desegregation cases, S. 619, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973); S. 179, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 2 (a) (1973); H. R. 13534, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 1 (1972), have similarly failed.</p>\n<p>[63]  In 1972, spurred by a finding \"that the process of eliminating or preventing minority group isolation and improving the quality of education for all children often involves the expenditure of additional funds to which local educational agencies do not have access,\" 86 Stat. 354, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1601 (a) (1976 ed.), Congress passed the Emergency School Aid Act. Section 706 (a) (1) (A) (i) of that Act, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1605 (a) (1) (A) (i) (1976 ed.), authorizes the Assistant Secretary\n</p>\n<p>\"to make a grant to, or a contract with, <i>a local educational agency [w]hich is implementing a plan . . . which has been undertaken pursuant to a final</i> <i>order issued by a court of the United States</i> . . . which requires the desegregation of minority group segregated children or faculty in the elementary and secondary schools of such agency, or otherwise requires the elimination or reduction of minority group isolation in such schools.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>A \"local educational agency\" is defined by 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1619 (8) (1976 ed.) as \"a public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control or direction of, public elementary or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State, or a federally recognized Indian reservation, or such combination of school districts, or counties as are recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools, or a combination of local educational agencies . . . .\" Congress thus clearly recognized that school boards were often parties to federal school desegregation suits. In \u00a7 718 of the Act, 86 Stat. 369, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1617 (1976 ed.), Congress gave its explicit approval to the institution of federal desegregation suits against school boards\u0097presumably under \u00a7 1983. Section 718 provides:</p>\n<p>\"Upon the entry of a final order <i>by a court of the United States against a local educational agency</i> . . . for discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in violation of . . . the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . . the court . . . may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Two years later in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, Congress found that \"the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required <i>local educational agencies</i> to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources . . . .\" 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1702 (a) (3) (1976 ed.). (Emphasis added.) Congress did not respond by declaring that school boards were not subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 or any other federal statute, \"but simply [legislated] revised evidentiary standards and remedial priorities to be employed by the courts in deciding such cases.\" Brief for National Education Assn. et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15-16. Indeed, Congress expressly reiterated that a cause of action, cognizable in the federal courts, exists for discrimination in the public school context. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703, 1706, 1708, 1710, 1718 (1976 ed.). The Act assumes that school boards will usually be the defendants in such suits. For example, \u00a7 211 of the Act, 88 Stat. 516, as set forth in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1710 (1976 ed.), provides:</p>\n<p>\"The Attorney General shall not institute a civil action under section 1706 of this title [which allows for suit by both private parties and the Attorney General to redress discrimination in public education] before he\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(a) gives to the appropriate educational agency notice of the condition or conditions which, in his judgment, constitute a violation of part 2 [the prohibitions against discrimination in public education].\" Section 219 of the Act, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1718 (1976 ed.), provides for the termination of court-ordered busing \"if the court finds the defendant educational agency has satisfied the requirements of the fifth or fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, whichever is applicable, and will continue to be in compliance with the requirements thereof.\"</p>\n<p>[64]  Whether Congress' attempt is in fact effective is the subject of <i>Hutto</i> v. <i>Finney,</i> O. T. 1977, No. 76-1660, cert. granted, 434 U. S. 901, and therefore we express no view on it here.</p>\n<p>[65]  We note, however, that Mr. Justice Harlan's test has not been expressly adopted by this Court. Moreover, that test is based on two factors: <i>stare decisis</i> and \"indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation [of the statute in question].\" 365 U. S., at 192. As we have explained, the second consideration is not present in this case.</p>\n<p>[66]  No useful purpose would be served by an attempt at this late date to determine whether <i>Monroe</i> was correct on its facts. Similarly, since this case clearly involves official policy and does not involve <i>respondeat superior,</i> we do not assay a view on how our cases which have relied on that aspect of <i>Monroe</i> that is overruled today\u0097<i>Moor</i> v. <i>County of Alameda,</i> 411 U. S. 693 (1973); <i>City of Kenosha</i> v. <i>Bruno,</i> 412 U. S. 507 (1973); and <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976)\u0097should have been decided on a correct view of \u00a7 1983. Nothing we say today affects the conclusion reached in <i>Moor,</i> see 411 U. S., at 703-704, that 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 cannot be used to create a federal cause of action where \u00a7 1983 does not otherwise provide one, or the conclusion reached in <i>City of Kenosha,</i> see 412 U. S., at 513, that \"nothing . . . suggest[s] that the generic word `person' in \u00a7 1983 was intended to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  The gravamen of the complaint in <i>Monroe</i> was that Chicago police officers acting \"under color of\" state law had conducted a warrantless, early morning raid and ransacking of a private home. Although at least one of the allegations in the complaint could have been construed to charge a custom or usage of the Police Department of the city of Chicago that did not violate state law, see 365 U. S., at 258-259 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part), and there is a hint of such a theory in Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, pp. 41-42, that feature of the case was not highlighted in this Court. The dispute that divided the Court was over whether a complaint alleging police misconduct in violation of state law, for which state judicial remedies were available, stated a \u00a7 1983 claim in light of the statutory requirement that the conduct working injury be \"under color of\" state law. Compare 365 U. S., at 172-183 (opinion of the Court), and <i>id.,</i> at 193-202 (Harlan, J., concurring), with <i>id.,</i> at 202-259 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  If in the view of House opponents, such as Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <i>ante,</i> at 679-680, a municipality obligated by state law to keep the peace could be held liable for a failure to provide equal protection against private violence, it seems improbable that they would have opposed imposition of liability on a municipality for the affirmative implementation of policies promulgated within its proper sphere of operation under state law. Such liability is premised not on a failure to take affirmative action in an area outside the contemplation of the state-law charter\u0097the sort of liability that would have been imposed by the Sherman amendment\u0097but on the consequences of activities actually undertaken within the scope of the powers conferred by state law.</p>\n<p>[3]  The view taken today is consistent with the understanding of the 42d Congress that unless the context revealed a more limited definition, \"the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . .\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431. It also accords with the interpretation given the same word when it was used by Senator Sherman in the antitrust legislation of 1890 bearing his name. See <i>Lafayette</i> v. <i>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</i> 435 U. S. 389 (1978) (plurality opinion); <i>Chattanooga Foundry</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> 203 U. S. 390, 396 (1906); cf. <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India,</i> 434 U. S. 308 (1978).</p>\n<p>[4]  See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Continental T. V., Inc.</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U. S. 36 (1977); <i>Machinists</i> v. <i>Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Comm'n,</i> 427 U. S. 132 (1976); <i>Braden</i> v. <i>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> 410 U. S. 484 (1973); <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Breckenridge,</i> 403 U. S. 88 (1971); <i>Boys Markets, Inc.</i> v. <i>Retail Clerks,</i> 398 U. S. 235 (1970); <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 406-407, n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[5]  The District Court in <i>Monroe</i> ruled in the municipality's favor, stating: \"[S]ince the liability of the City of Chicago is based on the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior,</i> and since I have already held that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief against the agents of the city, there is no claim for relief against the city itself.\" Record, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 30. The Court of Appeals affirmed for the same reason. 272 F. 2d 365-366 (CA7 1959).\n</p>\n<p>Petitioners in this Court also offered an alternative argument that the city of Chicago was a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 25, but the underlying theory of municipal liability remained one of <i>respondeat superior.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> advances two important values of a rational system of law: (i) the certainty of legal principles and (ii) the wisdom of the conservative vision that existing rules should be presumed rational and not subject to modification \"at any time a new thought seems appealing,\" dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, <i>post,</i> at 718; cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law 36 (1881). But, at the same time, the law has recognized the necessity of change, lest rules \"simply persis[t] from blind imitation of the past.\" Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). Any overruling of prior precedent, whether of a constitutional decision or otherwise, disserves to some extent the value of certainty. But I think we owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations. That is the premise of the canon of interpretation that language in a decision not necessary to the holding may be accorded less weight in subsequent cases. I also would recoguize the fact that until this case the Court has not had to confront squarely the consequences of holding \u00a7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, the mere fact that an issue was not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding. <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), cited by the dissent, <i>post,</i> at 718, is a case in point. But the Court's recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in <i>Marbury.</i> And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the <i>Marbury</i> holding. In <i>Monroe,</i> on the other hand, the Court's rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner. The language in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding \u00a7 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies. It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today's re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.</p>\n<p>[7]  In <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1, 16 (1976), we reaffirmed <i>Monroe,</i> but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of \u00a7 1983 under <i>Monroe,</i> and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim. Similarly, the parties in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274 (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested. There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.</p>\n<p>[9]  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST'S dissent makes a strong argument that \"[s]ince <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights.\" <i>Post,</i> at 717. But it reasonably may be assumed that most municipalities already indemnify officials sued for conduct within the scope of their authority, a policy that furthers the important interest of attracting and retaining competent officers, board members, and employees. In any event, the possibility of a qualified immunity, as to which the Court reserves decision, may remove some of the harshness of liability for good-faith failure to predict the often uncertain course of constitutional adjudication.</p>\n<p>[1]  As we pointed out in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983 is \"jurisdictional\" for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343, even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. See <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Hood,</i> 327 U. S. 678, 682 (1946).</p>\n<p>[2]  The other statutes cited by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of \u00a7 1983, but refer generally to suits against \"a local educational agency.\" As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266, such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either \u00a7 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted. The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages. Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.</p>\n<p>[3]  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of <i>Monroe,</i> my Brother POWELL relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that \"the exercise of \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction . . . [was] perhaps not premised on considered holdings.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 711.</p>\n<p>[4]  It has not been generally thought, before today, that \u00a7 1983 provided an avenue of relief from unconstitutional takings. Those federal courts which have granted compensation against state and local governments have resorted to an implied right of action under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <i>Richmond Elks Hall Assn.</i> v. <i>Richmond Redevelopment Agency,</i> 561 F. 2d 1327 (CA9 1977), aff'g <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></span> (ND Cal. 1975); <i>Foster</i> v. <i>Detroit,</i> 405 F. 2d 138, 140 (CA6 1968). Since the Court today abandons the holding of <i>Monroe</i> chiefly on the strength of Bingham's arguments, it is indeed anomalous that \u00a7 1983 will provide relief only when a local government, not the State itself, seizes private property. See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 54; <i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Bitzer,</i> 427 U. S. 445, 452 (1976); <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651, 674-677 (1974).</p>\n\n</div>",

In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  The gravamen of the complaint was that the Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.  The District Court found that petitioners' constitutional rights had been violated, but held that petitioners' claims for injunctive relief were mooted by a supervening change in the official maternity leave policy.  That court further held that <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, barred recovery of back pay from the Department, the Board, and the city.  In addition, to avoid circumvention of the immunity conferred by <i>Monroe</i>, the District Court held that natural persons sued in their official capacities as officers of a local government also enjoy the immunity conferred on local governments by that decision.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on a similar theory. <i>Held</i> :</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In <i>Monroe v. Pape, supra</i>, after examining the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, now codified as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and particularly the rejection of the so-called Sherman amendmen , the Court held that Congress in 1871 doubted its constitutional authority to impose civil liability on municipalities and therefore could not have intended to include municipal bodies within the class of \"persons\" subject to the Act. Re-examination of this legislative history compels the conclusion that Congress in 1871 would <i>not</i> have thought &#167; 1983 constitutionally infirm if it applied to local governments.  In addition, that history confirms that local governments were intended to be included among the \"persons\" to which &#167; 1983 applies.  Accordingly, <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> is overruled insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under &#167; 1983.  Pp. 664-689.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Local governing bodies (and local officials sued in their official capacities) can, therefore, be sued directly under &#167; 1983 for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief in those situations where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted or promulgated by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.  In addition, local governments, like every other &#167; 1983 \"person,\" may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \"custom\" even though such custom has not received formal approval through the government's official decision-making channels.  Pp. 690-691.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. On the other hand, the language and legislative history of &#167; 1983 compel the conclusion that Congress did not intend a local government to be held liable solely because it employs a tort-feasor&#8212;in other words, a local government cannot be held liable under &#167; 1983 on a <i>respondeat superior</i> theory.  Pp. 691-695.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> do not counsel against overruling <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion.  Pp. 695-701.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> departed from prior practice insofar as it completely immunized municipalities from suit under &#167; 1983. Moreover, since the reasoning of <i>Monroe</i> does not allow a distinction to be drawn between municipalities and school boards, this Court's many cases holding school boards liable in &#167; 1983 actions are inconsistent with <i>Monroe</i>, especially as the principle of that case was extended to suits for injunctive relief in <i>City of Kenosha v. Bruno</i>, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109. Pp. 695-696.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Similarly, extending absolute immunity to school boards would be inconsistent with several instances in which Congress has refused to immunize school boards from federal jurisdiction under &#167; 1983.  Pp. 696-699.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) In addition, municipalities cannot have arranged their affairs on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights for an indefinite period;  accordingly, municipalities have no reliance interest that would support an absolute immunity.  Pp. 699-700.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Finally, it appears beyond doubt from the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 that <i>Monroe</i> misapprehended the meaning of the Act.  Were &#167; 1983 unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state or local officers, yet the 1871 Congress clearly intended &#167; 1983 to apply to such officers and all agreed that such officers could constitutionally be subjected to liability under &#167; 1983.  The Act also unquestionably was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.  Therefore, without a clear statement in the legislative history, which is not present, there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the \"persons\" covered by &#167; 1983.  Pp. 700-701.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Local governments sued under &#167; 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest today's decision \"be drained of meaning,\" <i>Scheuer v.

In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the City of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F.Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conclusion.  The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <i>LaFleur, supra</i>.  394 F.Supp., at 855.  Nonetheless plaintiffs' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the City of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to \"circumven[t]\" the immunity conferred on municipalities by <i>Monroe v. Pape,</i> 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a \"person\" under &#167; 1983 because \"it performs a vital gov rnmental function  . . . ,  and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent  . . . ,  it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.\"  532 F.2d 259, 263 (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were \"persons\" under &#167; 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  532 F.2d, at 264. Yet, because a damages award would \"have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <i>Monroe v.

The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress' rejection of the \"Sherman amendment\" to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor of &#167; 1983.

An Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H.R. 320, a bill \"to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.\"  H.R. 320 contained four sections.  Section 1, now codified as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the \"other purpose\" of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections&#8212;not &#167; 1, now &#167; 1983&#8212;were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended.  The House finished its initial debates on H.R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Again, debate on &#167; 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to the vote on H.R. 320 in the Senate, Senator Sherman introduced his amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  This was <i>not</i> an amendment to &#167; 1 of the bill, but was to be added as &#167; 7 at the end of the bill.  Under the Senate rules, no discussion of the amendment was allowed and, although attempts were made to amend the amendment, it was passed as introduced.  In this form, the amendment did <i>not</i> place liability on municipal corporations, but made any inhabitant of a municipality liable for damage inflicted by persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The House refused to acquiesce in a number of amendments made by the Senate, including the Sherman amendment, and the respective versions of H.R. 320 were therefore sent to a conference committee.  Section 1 of the bill, however, was not a subject of this conference since, as noted, it was passed verbatim as introduced in both Houses of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 1871, the first conference committee completed its work on H.R. 320.  The main features of the conference committee draft of the Sherman amendment were these:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  First, a cause of action was given to persons injured by</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled      together  . . .  with intent to deprive any person of any      right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the      United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising      such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous      condition of servitude  . . . .\" Second, the bill provided that the action would be against the county, city, or parish in which the riot had occurred and that it could be maintained by either the person injured or his legal representative.  Third, unlike the amendment as proposed, the conference substitute made the government defendant liable on the judgment if it was not satisfied against individual defendants who had committed the violence.  If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any      other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the      enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations;  and      such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys      in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the      other property thereof.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendmen , Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property \"responsible\" for Ku Klux Klan damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes:  The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House.  House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported &#167; 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters.  And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform.  This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <i>Monroe</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report.  The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made \"any person or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,\" who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is not codified as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee.  This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment&#8212;on which our holding in <i>Monroe</i> was based, see <i>supra</i>, at 664&#8212;would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights.  Because &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret &#167; 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the \"persons\" to whom that section applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Debate on the First Conference Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States.  Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality.  Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on &#167; 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes \"in the States,\" had also raised questions of federal power.  The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H.R. 320, is the most complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shellabarger began his discussion of H.R. 320 by stating that \"there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.\" Globe, App. 67.  There were analogies, however.  With respect to the meaning of &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its Privileges or Immunities Clause, Shellabarger relied on the statement of Mr. Justice Washington in <i>Corfield v. Coryell,</i> 3 F.Cas. 230, 4 Wash.C.C. 371 (CC ED Pa.1825), which defined the privileges protected by Art. IV:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" 'What these fundamental privileges are[,] it would      perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate.

Here again there were precedents:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[Congress has always] assumed to enforce, as against the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions  f      the Constitution.  Most of the provisions of the Constitution      which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as      those in [Art. I, &#167; 10,] relate to the divisions of the      political powers of the State and General Governments.  . . .      These prohibitions upon political powers of the States are      all of such nature that they can be, and even have been,  . .      .  enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void      all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers.  Thus, and      thus sufficiently, has the United States 'enforced' these      provisions of the Constitution.  But there are some that are      not of this class.  These are where the court secures the      rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as      between such persons and the States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"These three are:  first, that as to fugitives from      justice;<sup>[</sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a><sup>]</sup>  second, that as to fugitives from service, (or      slaves;)<sup>[</sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a><sup>]</sup>  third, that declaring that the 'citizens of      each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and      immunities of citizens in the several States.'<sup>[</sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a><sup>]</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"And, sir, every one of these&#8212;the only provisions where it      was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the      constitutional provisions&#8212;the only three where the rights or      liabilities of persons in the States, as between these      persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress      has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect  . . .      such persons.\"  Globe App. 69-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV&#8212;the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302&#8212;the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in <i>Prigg v. Pennsylvania</i>, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L.Ed. 1060.  There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found.  16 Pet., at 612.  Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation.  <i>Id.</i>, at 614.  Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right and this in turn required a remedy, Story held it to be a \"natural inference\" that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right.  <i>Id.</i>, at 615.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on <i>Prigg</i>, Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate&#8212;and hence constitutional&#8212;method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen's federal right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining was \"whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, <i>any obligations to keep the peace</i> in obedience to United States laws.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  This he answered affirmatively, citing <i>Board of Comm'rs v.

The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The proposition known as the Sherman amendment  . . .  is entirely new.

The power that laid the obligation upon      the hundred first put the duty upon the hundred that it      should perform in that regard, and failing to meet the      obligation which had been laid upon it, it was very proper      that it should suffer damage for its neglect.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\". . .

Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair:  First, Blair's analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <i>Monroe</i>, see <i>supra</i>, at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  Second, Blair's exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent&#8212;albeit precedent that has not survived, see <i>Ex parte Virginia</i>, 100 U.S. 339, 347-348, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880); <i>Graves  . New York ex rel. O'Keefe</i>, 306 U.S. 466, 486, 59 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed. 927 (1939)&#8212;and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Collector v. Day</i>, cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were \"subject to the control of another and distinct government.\"  11 Wall., at 127.  Although the Court in <i>Day</i> apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing \"power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax,\" <i>id.</i>, at 125-126;  cf. <i>McCulloch v. Maryland</i>, 17 U.S. 316, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Prigg v. Pennsylvania,</i> for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see <i>supra</i>, at 672, held that Congress could not \"insist that states  . . .  provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government.\"  16 Pet., at 615-616.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>  And Mr. Justice McLean agreed that, \"[a]s a general principle,\" it was true \"that Congress had no power to impose duties on state officers, as provided in the [Act of Feb. 12, 1793].\"  Nonetheless he wondered whether Congress might not impose \"positive\" duties on state officers where a clause of the Constitution, like the Fugitive Slave Clause, seemed to require affirmative government assistance, rather than restraint of government, to secure federal rights.  See <i>id.</i>, at 664-665.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by \"positive\" action the protection<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> owed individuals under &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep the peace.  However, any such argument, largely foreclosed by <i>Prigg</i>, was made impossible by the Court's holding in <i>Kentucky v. Dennison</i>, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861).  There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by &#167; 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> which implemented Art. IV, &#167; 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under      the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer,      as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it;      for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer      with duties which would fill up all his time, and disable him      from performing his obligations to the State, and might      impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the      rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.\"  24      How., at 107-108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale of <i>Dennison</i> &#8212;that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities&#8212;is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in <i>Collector v. Day</i>.  See <i>supra</i>, at 676. And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.  Although no one cited <i>Dennison</i> by name, the principle for which it stands was well known to Members of Congress,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> many of whom discussed <i>Day</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> in the mid-1860's which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  Thus, there was ample support for Blair's view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson's choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to \"destroy the government of the States.\" Globe 795.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If municipal liability under &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson's choice, we might conclude, as <i>Monroe</i> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the \"persons\" to which that section applied.  But this is not the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdictio  on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution&#8212;which is as far as &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act went:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"I presume  . . .  that where a State had imposed a duty      [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality  . . .  an action      would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts      of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to      jurisdiction.  But the enforcing a liability, existing by      their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a      very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or      liability upon them by the national Government, which has no      power either to create or destroy them, and no power or      control over them whatever.\"  Globe 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Representative Burchard agreed:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]here is no duty imposed by the Constitution of the      United States, or usually by State laws, upon a county to      protect the people of that county against the commission of      the offenses herein enumerated, such as the burning of      buildings or any other injury to property or injury to      person.  Police powers are not conferred upon counties as      corporations;  they are conferred upon cities that have      qualified legislative power.  And so far as cities are      concerned, where the equal protection required to be afforded      by a State is imposed upon a city by State laws, perhaps the      United States courts could enforce its performance.  But      counties  . . .  do not have any control of the police  . . .      .\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 795.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at n.30, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it.  Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <i>Prigg</i>, this is quite understandable.  So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the \"positive\" government action required to protect federal constitutional rights and no question was raised of enlisting the States in \"positive\" action.  The limits of the principles announced in <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day</i> are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history.  It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered <i>Day</i> also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalities&#8212;an enforcement effort which included various forms of \"positive\" relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution's express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in <i>Dennison</i> or <i>Day</i>, have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary.  Since &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment&#8212;a situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against municipalitiess is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to &#167; 1 suits against municipalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment but who had voted for &#167; 1, confirm that the liability imposed by &#167; 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment.  Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal <i>officials</i> who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a>  However, for <i>Prigg-Dennison-Day</i> purposes, as Blair and others recognized,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agents&#8212;including corporate agents&#8212;of the State:  Both were state instrumentalities and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power.  <i>Dennison</i> and <i>Day</i>, after all, were not suits against municipalities but against <i>officers</i>, and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of &#167; 1&#8212;<i>inter alia</i>, complaining that it would be applied to state officers, see Globe App. 217&#8212;and who opposed both &#167; 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on<i>Prigg</i> grounds, agreed unequivocally that &#167; 1 was constitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  Those who voted for &#167; 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite <i>Prigg, Dennison,</i> and <i>Day</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Debate on &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Bill</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under &#167; 1&#8212;\"any person\"&#8212;covers more than natural persons.  An examination of the debate on &#167; 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that &#167; 1 was intended to cover legal as well as natural persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of &#167; 1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for      persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves,      but also to all people where, under color of State law, they      or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are      entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their      national citizenship.\"  Globe App. 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By extending a remedy to all people, including whites, &#167; 1 went beyond the mischief to which the remaining sections of the 1871 Act were addressed.  Representative Shellabarger also stated without reservation that the constitutionality of &#167; 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 controlled the constitutionality of &#167; 1 of the 1871 Act, and that the former had been approved by \"the supreme courts of at least three States of this Union\" and by Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting on circuit, who had concluded:  \" 'We have no doubt of the constitutionality of every provision of this act.' \"  Globe App. 68.  Representative Shellabarger then went on to describe how the courts would and should interpret &#167; 1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of      human liberty and human rights.  All statutes and      constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are      liberally and beneficently construed.  It would be most      strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the      rule of interpretation.  As has been again and again decided      by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and      everywhere else where there is wise judicial interpretation,      the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is      uniformly given in construing such statutes and      constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend      and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people.  . . .

Cf., <i>e. g., Ex parte Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 339, 346-347, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880);  <i>Home Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Los Angeles,</i> 227 U.S. 278, 286-287, 294-296, 33 S.Ct. 312, 57 L.Ed. 510 (1913).  One need not rely on this inference alone, however, for the debates show that Members of Congress understood \"persons\" to include municipal corporations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Representative Bingham, for example, in discussing &#167; 1 of the bill, explained that he had drafted &#167; 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with the case of <i>Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore,</i> 7 Pet. 243, 8 L.Ed. 672 (1833), especially in mind.  \"In [that] case the city had taken private property for public use, without COMPENSATION  . . . , AND THERE WAS NO REDRESS FOR THE wrong  . . . .\"  globe App. 84 (emphasis added).  Bingham's further remarks clearly indicate his view that such takings by cities, as had occurred in <i>Barron,</i> would be redressable under &#167; 1 of the bill. See Globe App. 85.  More generally, and as Bingham's remarks confirm, &#167; 1 of the bill would logically be the vehicle by which Congress provided redress for takings, since that section provided the only civil remedy for Fourteenth Amendment viola ions and that Amendment unequivocally prohibited uncompensated takings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a>  Given this purpose, it beggars reason to suppose that Congress would have exempted municipalities from suit, insisting instead that compensation for a taking come from an officer in his individual capacity rather than from the government unit that had the benefit of the property taken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.  This had not always been so.  When this Court first considered the question of the status of corporations, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, denied that corporations \"as such\" were persons as that term was used in Art. III and the Judiciary Act of 1789.  See <i>Bank of the United States v.

Mercer County,</i> 7 Wall. 118, 121, 19 L.Ed. 86 (1869), the <i>Letson</i> principle was automatically and without discussion extended to municipal corporations.  Under this doctrine, municipal corporations were routinely sued in the federal courts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> and this fact was well known to Members of Congress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the \"usual\" meaning of the word \"person\" would extend to municipal corporations is also evidenced by an Act of Congress which had been passed only months before the Civil Rights Act was passed.

Indeed, a Circuit Judge, writing in 1873 in what is apparently the first reported case under &#167; 1, read the Dictionary Act in precisely this way in a case involving a corporate plaintiff and a municipal defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a>  See <i>Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v.

Moreover, although the touchstone of the &#167; 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other &#167; 1983 \"person,\" by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \"custom\" even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body's official decisionmaking channels.  As Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said in <i>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co.,</i> 398 U.S. 144, 167-168, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1613, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970): \"Congress included customs and usages [in &#167; 1983] because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials  . . . .

In particular, we conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable <i>solely</i> because it employs a tortfeasor&#8212;or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under &#167; 1983 on a <i>respondeat superior</i> theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the language of &#167; 1983 as originally passed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"<i>[A]ny person who,</i> under color of any law, statute,      ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, <i>shall      subject, or cause to be subjected,</i> any person  . . .  to the      deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured      by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the      State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party      injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper      proceeding for redress  . . . .\"  17 Stat. 13.  (emphasis      added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The italicized language plainly imposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, \"causes\" an employee to violate another's constitutional rights.  At the same time, that language cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor. Indeed, the fact that Congress did specifically provide that A's tort became B's liability if B \"caused\" A to subject another to a tort suggests that Congr &#167;&#167; did not intend &#167; 1983 liability to attach where such causation was absent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a>  See <i>Rizzo v. Goode,</i> 423 U.S. 362, 370-371, 96 S.Ct. 598, 602, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important, creation of a federal law of <i>respondeat superior</i> would have raised all the constitutional problems associated with the obligation to keep the peace, an obligation Congress chose not to impose because it thought imposition of such an obligation unconstitutional.  To this day, there is disagreement about the basis for imposing liability on an employer for the torts of an employee when the sole nexus between the employer and the tort is the fact of the employer-employee relationship.  See W. Prosser, Law of Torts &#167; 69, p. 459 (4th ed. 1971).  Nonetheless, two justifications tend to stand out.  First is the common-sense notion that no matter how blameless an employer appears to be in an individual case, accidents might nonetheless be reduced if employers had to bear the cost of accidents.  See, <i>e. g., ibid.;</i>  2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts, &#167; 26.3, pp. 1368-1369 (1956).  Second is the argument that the cost of accidents should be spread to the community as a whole on an insurance theory.  See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> &#167; 26.5;  Prosser, <i>supra,</i> at 459.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first justification is of the same sort that was offered for statutes like the Sherman amendment:  \"The obligation to make compensation for injury resulting from riot is, by arbitrary enactment of statutes, affirmatory law, and the reason of passing the statute is to secure a more perfect police regulation.\"  Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).  This justification was obviously insufficient to sustain the amendment against perceived constitutional difficulties and there is no reason to suppose that a more general liability imposed for a similar reason would have been thought less constitutionally objectionable.  The second justification was similarly put forward as a justification for the Sherman amendment:  \"we do not look upon [the Sherman amendment] as a punishment  . . . .  It is a mutual insurance.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler).  Again, this justification was insufficient to sustain the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be sued under &#167; 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.  Instead, it is when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under &#167; 1983.  Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see <i>supra</i>, at 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below.  In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under &#167; 1983 may be.  We have attempted only to sketch so much of the &#167; 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have stated that <i>stare decisis</i> has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, <i>e. g., Edelman v. Jordan</i>, 415 U.S. 651, 671, and n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1365, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), we have never applied <i>stare decisis</i> mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.  See, <i>e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.</i>, 433 U.S. 36, 47-49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2559, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977);  <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.</i>, 285 U.S. 393, 406 n. 1, 52 S.Ct. 443, 454, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Nor is this a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\"  <i>Girouard v. United States</i>, 328 U.S. 61, 70, 66 S.Ct. 826, 830, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, <i>Monroe v. Pape,</i> insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under &#167; 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, <i>e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park</i>, 18 Fed.Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill.1873);  <i>City of Manchester v. Leiby</i>, 117 F.2d 661 (CA1 1941);  <i>Hannan v. City of Haverhill</i>, 120 F.2d 87 (CA1 1941);  <i>Douglas v. City of Jeannette</i>, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 ( 943);  <i>Holmes v. City of Atlanta</i>, 350 U.S. 879, 76 S.Ct. 141, 100 L.Ed. 776 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in &#167; 1983 suits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a> Moreover, the constitutional defect that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See <i>supra</i>, at 673-682.  For this reason, our cases&#8212;decided both before and after <i>Monroe</i>, see n. 5, <i>supra</i> &#8212;holding school boards liable in &#167; 1983 actions are inconsistent with <i>Monroe</i>, especially as <i>Monroe</i> &#167; immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in <i>City of Kenosha v. Bruno</i>, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a>  And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not \"disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.\"  <i>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States</i>, 370 U.S. 294, 307, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 1514, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962);  see <i>Bank of the United States v. Deveaux,</i> 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.)  (\"Those decisions are not cited as authority  . . .  but they have much weight as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench\").  Thus, while we have reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i> without further examination on three occasions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a> it can scarcely be said that <i>Monroe</i> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been &#167; 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  Finally, in regard to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in &#167; 1983 suitsto obtain attorney's fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local      <i>bodies</i> or State or local officials.  In such cases it is      intended that the attorneys' fees, like other items of costs,      will be collected either directly from the official, <i>in his      official capacity</i>, from funds of his agency or under his      control, or <i>from the State or local government (whether or      not the agency or government is a named party)</i>.\"      S.Rep.No.94-1011, p. 5 (1976);  U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News      1976, pp. 5908, 5913 (emphasis added;  footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from showing that Congress has relied on <i>Monroe</i>, therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <i>Monroe</i> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though <i>Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno</i>, and <i>Aldinger v. Howard</i>, 427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can support an absolute immunity.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <i>Monroe</i>, \"[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.\"  365 U.S., at 221-222, 81 S.Ct., at 503 (dissenting in part).  Indeed, municipalities simply cannot \"arrange their affairs\" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under &#167; 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <i>Monroe</i> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <i>Monroe</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a>&#8212;\"that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>Monroe</i> ] misapprehended the meaning of the [section],\" 365 U.S., at 192, 81 S.Ct., at 487 (concurring opinion)&#8212;the overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it holds that local governments are not \"persons\" who may be defendants in &#167; 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress' view of the law, were &#167; 1983  iability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.  Yet everyone proponents and opponents alike&#8212;knew &#167; 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that &#167; 1983 was constitutional.  See<i>supra</i>, at 680-682.  And, moreover, there can be no doubt that &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.  Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that &#167; 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation&#8212;which simply is not present&#8212;there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the \"persons\" covered by &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that <i>stare decisis</i> does not bar our overruling of <i>Monroe</i> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under &#167; 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under &#167; 1983 \"be drained of meaning,\" <i>Scheuer v.

Pape,</i> 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), decided less than two decades ago.  Focusing new light on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of the 1871 measure.  But <i>Monroe</i> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entities&#8212;even when they act pursuant to express authorization.  The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <i>Monroe</i> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court's opinion today.  Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> the <i>Monroe</i> Court treated the 42d Congress' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury.  That reading, in light of today's thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision,\" <i>Monroe, supra,</i> at 192, 81 S.Ct. at 487 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. <i>Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,</i> 414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974), the Court decides \"not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late,\" <i>Henslee v. Union Planters Bank,</i> 335 U.S. 595, 600, 69 S.Ct. 290, 293, 93 L.Ed. 259 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of \"riot act\" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness.  As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of &#167; 1 of the 1871 legislation&#8212;now &#167; 1983&#8212;that \"any person\" acting \"under color of\" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that \"subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person  . . .  to the deprivation of any\" federal constitutional or statutory right.  Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports <i>Monroe</i> &#167; observation that  he 42d Congress was fundamentally \"antagonistic,\" 365 U.S., at 191, 81 S.Ct. 473, to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation.  Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal's unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of &#167; 1983 judgment lienors.  <i>Ante,</i> at 673-674, n. 30.  The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment's attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces.  <i>Ante,</i> at 673-675, 679-682.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court correctly rejects a view of the legislative history that would produce the anomalous result of immunizing local government units from monetary liability for action directly causing a constitutional deprivation, even though such actions may be fully consistent with, and thus not remediable under, state law.  No conduct of government comes more clearly within the \"under color of\" state law language of &#167; 1983.  It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be <i>exclusively</i> liable for resulting constitutional injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As elaborated in Part II of today's opinion, the rejection of the Sherman amendment can best be understood not as evidence of Congress' acceptance of a rule of absolute municipal immunity but as a limitation of the statutory ambit to actual wrongdoers, <i>i. e.,</i> a rejection of <i>respondeat superior</i> or any other principle of vicarious liability.  Cf. Levin, The Section 1983 Municipal Immunity Doctrine, 65 Geo.L.J. 1483, 1531-1535 (1977).  Thus, it has been clear that a public official may be held liable in damages when his actions are found to violate a constitutional right and there is no qualified immunity, see <i>Wood v. Strickland,</i> 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 922, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975);  <i>Procunier v. Navarette,</i> 434 U.S. 555, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978). Today the Court recognizes that this principle also applies to a local government when implementation of its official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court tradi ionally has been hesitant to overrule prior constructions of statutes or interpretations of common-law rules. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy,\" <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U.S. 393, 406, 52 S.Ct. 443, 447, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but this cautionary principle must give way to countervailing considerations in appropriate circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  I concur in the Court's view that this is not a case where we should \"place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.\"  <i>Girouard v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 61, 70, 66 S.Ct. 826, 830, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this the usual case in which the Court is asked to overrule a precedent.  Here considerations of <i>stare decisis</i> cut in both directions.  On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not \"persons\" for purposes of &#167; 1983.  On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to &#167; 1983 suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Monroe</i> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court&#8212;whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies.  \"The theory of the complaint [in <i>Monroe</i> was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of <i>respondeat superior.</i>\"  Brief for Petitioners, O.T.1960, No. 39, p. 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>  Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners' position would expose \"Chicago and every other municipality in the United States  . . .  to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of.\"  Brief for Respondents, O.T.1960, No. 39, p. 26.  Thus the ground of decision in <i>Monroe</i> was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>Moor v. County of Alameda,</i> 411 U.S. 693, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), petitioners asserted that \"the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff,\" <i>id.,</i> at 696, 93 S.Ct. at 1789, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988. In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, 411 U.S., at 710, and n. 27, 93 S.Ct., at 1796, and n. 27, we reaffirmed <i>Monroe</i> 's reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to \"the holding in <i>Monroe</i> concerning the status under &#167; 1983 of public entities such as the County,\" 411 U.S., at 700, 93 S.Ct., at 1790;  Brief for Petitioners, O.T.1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only in <i>City of Kenosha v. Bruno,</i> 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), did the Court confront a &#167; 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury.  In <i>Kenosha,</i> however, we raised the issue of the city's amenability to suit under &#167; 1983 on our own initiative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of cases&#8212;from <i>Monroe</i> to <i>Kenosha</i> &#8212;is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases in which the Court has assumed <i>sub silentio</i> that some local government entities could be sued under &#167; 1983.  If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <i>Monroe,</i> grave doubt would be cast upon the Court's exercise of &#167; 1983 jurisdiction over school boards.  See <i>ante,</i> at 663 n. 5. Since \"the principle of blanket immunity established in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be cabined short of school boards,\" <i>ante,</i> at 696, the conflict is squarely presented.  Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explici  reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, <i>e. g., Green v. County School Board,</i> 391 U.S. 430, 437-439, 441-442, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968);  <i>Milliken v. Bradley,</i> 433 U.S. 267, 292-293, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  And, as the Court points out, <i>ante,</i> at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court's school board decisions in several statutes.  Thus the exercise of &#167; 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding.  Indeed, it predated <i>Monroe</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which \"may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either &#167; 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908),\" <i>post,</i> at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents.  At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief.  <i>Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board,</i> 326 F.Supp. 1159, 1161 (ED Va.1971), rev'd, 474 F.2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, 414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974); <i>Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist.,</i> 393 U.S. 503, 504, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).  See also <i>Vlandis v. Kline,</i> 412 U.S. 441, 445, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973).  Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claimsfor damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable.  Cf. <i>Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>  Moreover the rationale of <i>Kenosha</i> would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under &#167; 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government.  The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of <i>Ex parte Young</i> into &#167; 1983, 532 F.2d 259, 264-266 (CA2 1976).  That approach, however, would create tension with <i>Kenosha</i> because it would require \"a bifurcated application\" of \"the generic word 'person' in &#167; 1983\" to public officials \"depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\"  412 U.S., at 513, 93 S.Ct. at 2226.  A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a \"person\" for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-\"person\" in an action for damages.  The Court's holding avoids this difficulty.  See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under &#167; 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether \"we should, by analogy to our decision in <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in &#167; 1983  . . . .\"  <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 278, 97 S.Ct. 568, 571, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).  One aspect of that inquiry would be whether there are any \"special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\" <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</i>, 403 U.S. 388, 396, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2005, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), such as an \"explicit congressional declaration that persons injured by a [municipality] may not recover money damages  . . . ,  but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the vi w of Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 397, 91 S.Ct. at 2005.  In light of the Court's persuasive re-examination in today's decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from &#167; 1983 \"an explicit congressional declaration\" against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution.  Rather than constitutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Difficult questions nevertheless remain for another day. There are substantial line-drawing problems in determining \"when execution of a government's policy or custom\" can be said to inflict constitutional injury such that \"government as an entity is responsible under &#167; 1983.\"  <i>Ante,</i> at 694.  This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board;  it is the clear case.  The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity. <i>Ante,</i> at 701.  Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see <i>post,</i> at 720-721, or other principles support a qualified municipal immunity in the context of the &#167; 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Parts II and IV of the opinion of the Court are merely advisory and are not necessary to explain the Court's decision, I join only Parts I, III, and V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seventeen years ago, in <i>Monroe v.

Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions. <i>Aldinger v. Howard,</i> 427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976);  <i>City of Kenosha v. Bruno,</i> 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973);  <i>Moor v. County of Alameda,</i> 411 U.S. 693, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973).  See also <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 277-279, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).  Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961.  Because I cannot agree that this Court is \"free to disregard these precedents,\" which have been \"considered maturely and recently\" by this Court, <i>Runyon v. McCrary,</i> 427 U.S. 160, 186, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* As this Court has repeatedly recognized, <i>id.,</i> at 175 n. 12, 96 S.Ct., at 2596;  <i>Edelman v.

In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court's settle  construction of the law, but the Congress is at liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit.  The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is usually the wise policy, because in      most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of      law be settled than that it be settled right.  . . .  This is      commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious      concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.  But      in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction      through legislative action is practically impossible, this      court has often overruled its earlier decisions.\"  <i>Burnet v.

The Court's first assertion, that <i>Monroe</i> \"was a departure from prior practice,\" <i>ante,</i> at 695, is patently erroneous.  Neither in <i>Douglas v. City of Jeannette,</i> 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1943), nor in <i>Holmes v.

As recently as four Terms ago, we said in <i>Hagans v. Lavine,</i> 415 U.S. 528, 535 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1378 n. 5, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been      passed on in prior decisions <i>sub silentio,</i> this Court has      never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally      brings the jurisdictional issue before us.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The source of this doctrine that jurisdictional issues decided <i>sub silentio</i> are not binding in other cases seems to be Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's remark in <i>United States v.

Of a l its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, &#167; 2, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a>  The 1976 Act provides that attorney's fees may be awardedto the prevailing party \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title.\"  There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections;  it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney's fees.  As the Court admits, <i>ante,</i> at 699, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed \"whether or not the agency or government is a named party,\" S.Rep.No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976);  U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5912, suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well-known holding of <i>Monroe.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's assertion that municipalities have no right to act \"on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely,\" <i>ante,</i> at 700, is simply beside the point.  Since <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights. No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of <i>stare decisis.</i>  To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot agree with Mr. Justice POWELL's view that \"[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6.  Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind.  To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), forward, in which the explicit ground of decision \"was never actually briefed or argued,\" <i>ante,</i> at 708 (POWELL, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law.  Indeed, in <i>Marbury</i> itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicants&#8212;which, unlike the arguments in <i>Monroe,</i> is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see it&#8212;devotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress.  Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance.  1 Cranch, at 153-154.  More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother POWELL's analysis.  In <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule <i>Wolf v. Colorado,</i> 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949);  it did so only at the request of an <i>amicus curiae.</i>  367 U.S., at 646 n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1684.  That <i>Marbury, Mapp,</i> and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary by-product of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present \"all the relevant considerations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 709 n. 6 (POWELL, J., concurring).  While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2\" id=\"fn3-2_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress.  That intent was first expounded in <i>Monroe,</i> and it has been followed consistently ever since.  This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference.  Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <i>Monroe.</i>  124 Cong.Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978).  In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of <i>stare decisis</i> require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings.  <i>Monroe</i> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated \"beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [<i>Monroe</i> ] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\"  <i>Monroe</i>, 365 U.S., at 192, 81 S.Ct., at 487 (Harlan, J., concurring).  The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting &#167; 1, it intended to impose that liability.  I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any analysis of the meaning of the word \"person\" in &#167; 1983, which was originally enacted as &#167; 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act.  The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"That in all acts hereafter passed  . . .  the word      'person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and      corporate  . . .  unless the context shows that such words      were intended to be used in a more limited sense  . . . .\"      Act of Feb. 25, 1871, &#167; 2, 16 Stat. 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word \"person\" where the context suggests a more limited reach.  Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person.  Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act's provision that \"words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females,\" might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women.  Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted &#167; 1983 may well have intended the word \"person\" \"to be used in a more limited sense,\" as <i>Monroe</i> concluded.  It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, <i>Louisville R. Co. v. Letson,</i> 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), and municipal corporations, <i>Cowles v. Mercer County,</i> 7 Wall. 118, 121, 19 L.Ed. 86 (1869), were \"citizens\" of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III.  Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court in <i>Pa l v. Virginia,</i> 8 Wall. 168, 19 L.Ed. 357 (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be \"citizens\" within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S.Const., Art. IV, &#167; 2.  Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts.  Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that &#167; 1 \"was so very simple and really reenact[ed] the Constitution.\"  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds).  At the time &#167; 1983 was enacted the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a \"citizen\" nor a \"person.\"  <i>Insurance Co. v. New Orleans,</i> 13 Fed.Cas. 67 (No. 7,052) (CC La.1870).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the state courts did not speak with a single voice with regard to the tort liability of municipal corporations. Although many Members of Congress represented States which had retained absolute municipal tort immunity, see, <i>e. g., Irvine v. Town of Greenwood,</i> 89 S.C. 511, 72 S.E. 228 (1911) (collecting earlier cases), other States had adopted the currently predominant distinction imposing liability for proprietary acts, see generally 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts &#167; 29.6 (1956), as early as 1842, <i>Bailey v. Mayor of City of New York,</i> 3 Hill 531 (N.Y.1842).  Nevertheless, no state court had ever held that municipal corporations were always liable in tort in precisely the same manner as other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general remarks from the floor on the liberal purposes of &#167; 1 offer no explicit guidance as to the parties against whom the remedy could be enforced.  As the Court concedes, only Representative Bingham raised a concern which could be satisfied only by relief against governmental bodies.  Yet he never directly related this concern to &#167; 1 of the Act.  Indeed, Bingham stated at the outset, \"I do not propose now to discuss the provisions of the bill in detail,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 82 (1871), and, true to his word, he launched into an extended discourse on the beneficent purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. While Bingham clearly stated that Congress could \"provide that no citizen in any State shall be deprived of his property by State law or the judgment of a State court without just compensation therefor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 85, he never suggested that such a power was exercised in &#167; 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a> Finally, while Bingham has often been advanced as the chief expositor of the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Duncan v. Louisiana,</i> 391 U.S. 145, 165, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) (Black, J., concurring);  <i>Adamson v. California,</i> 332 U.S. 46, 73-74, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting), there is nothing to indicate that his colleagues placed any greater credence in his theories than has this Court.  See <i>Duncan, supra,</i> at 174-176, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (Harlan, J., dissenting);  <i>Adamson, supra,</i> at 64, 67 S.Ct. 1672 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it ought not lightly to be presumed, as the Court does today, <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 53 that &#167; 1983 \"should prima facie be construed to include 'bodies politic' among the entities that could be sued.\"  Neither the Dictionary Act, the ambivalent state of judicial decisions, nor the floor debate on &#167; 1 of the Act gives any indication that any Member of Congress had any inkling that &#167; 1 could be used to impose liability on municipalities. Although Senator Thurman, as the Court emphasizes, <i>ante,</i> at 686 n. 45, expressed his belief that the terms of &#167; 1 \"are as comprehensive as can be used,\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871), an examination of his lengthy remarks demonstrates that it never occurred to him that &#167; 1 did impose or could have imposed any liability upon municipal corporations.  In an extended parade of horribles, this \"old Roman,\" who was one of the Act's most implacable opponents, suggested that state legislatures, Members of Congress, and state judges might be held liable under the Act.  <i>Ibid.</i>  If, at that point in the debate, he had any idea that &#167; 1 was designed to impose tort liability upon cities and counties, he would surely have raised an additional outraged objection.  Only once was that possibility placed squarely before the Congress&#8212;in its consideration of the Sherman amendment&#8212;and the Congress squarely rejected it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court is probably correct that the rejection of the Sherman amendment does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Congress intended municipalities to be immune from liability under all circumstances.  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress' understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context.  Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no      property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can      we levy on the courthouse and sell it?  So this section      provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action <i>ex      delicto,</i> where the county has never entered into any      contract, where the State has never authorized the county to      assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability      upon it.  It is in my opinion simply absurd.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 799      (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented.  Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended &#167; 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of \"person,\" and thus the reasoning of <i>Monroe</i> on this point is subject to challenge.  The meaning of &#167; 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <i>Monroe</i>, and it may well be that on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates a conclusion contrary to the <i>Monroe</i> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago.  But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected. Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on &#167; 1 that the word \"person\" was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing \"beyond doubt\" tha  this Court in <i>Monroe</i> \"misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.\"  Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <i>Monroe</i> do not end the inquiry as to <i>stare decisis</i> ;  they merely begin it.  I would adhere to the holding of<i>Monroe</i> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision in <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years.  Using &#167; 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <i>Monroe</i> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials' failure to predict the course of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today's removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law.  It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint was amended on September 14, 1972, to allege a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i> (1970 ed. and Supp. V). The District Court held that the 1972 amendments to Title VII did not apply retroactively to discrimination suffered prior to those amendments even when an action challenging such prior discrimination was pending on the date of the amendments.  394 F.Supp. 853, 856 (SDNY 1975).  This holding was affirmed on appeal.  532 F.2d 259, 261-262 (CA2 1976).

Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position. He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal</p>\n        <p>Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection.  That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc.  He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the <i>States</i> the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated.  See <i>id.</i>, at 791.</p>\n        <p>Opponents of the Sherman amendment in the Senate agreed with Blair that Congress had no power to pass the Sherman amendment because it fell outside limits on national power implicit in the federal structure of the Constitution and recognized in, <i>e. g., Collector v. Day</i>, 11 Wall. 113, 20 L.Ed. 122 (1871).  However, the Senate opponents focused not on the amendment's attempt to obligate municipalities to keep the peace, but on the lien created by the amendment, which ran against <i>all</i> money and property of a defendant municipality, including property held for public purposes, such as jails or courthouses.  Opponents argued that such a lien once entered would have the effect of making it impossible for the municipality to function, since no one would trade with it.  See, <i>e. g.</i>, Globe 762 (Sen. Stevenson);  <i>id.</i>, at 763 (Sen. Casserly).  Moreover, everyone knew that sound policy prevented execution against public property since this, too, was needed if local government was to survive.  See, <i>e. g., ibid.</i>  See also <i>Meriwether v. Garrett</i>, 102 U.S. 472, 501, 513, 26 L.Ed. 197 (1880) (recognizing principle that public property of a municipality was not subject  o execution);  2 J.

Since this Court granted unquestionably \"positive\" relief in Contract Clause cases, it appears that the distinction between the Sherman amendment and those cases was not that the former created a positive obligation whereas the latter imposed only a negative restraint.  Instead, the distinction must have been that a violation of the Constitution was the predicate for \"positive\" relief in the Contract Clause cases, whereas the Sherman amendment imposed damages without regard to whether a local government was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages.  See <i>supra</i>, at 668.  While no one stated this distinction expressly during the debates, the inference is strong that Congressmen in 1871 would have drawn this distinction since it explains why Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <i>supra</i>, at 680, could oppose the amendment while at the same time saying that the Federal Government might impose damages on a local government that had defaulted in a state-imposed duty to keep the peace, and it also explains why everyone agreed that a state or municipal officer could constitutionally be held liable under &#167; 1 for violations of the Constitution.

A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.</p>\n        <p>There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of \"person,\" but Senator Trumbull, the Act's sponsor, discussed the phrase \"words importing the masculine gender <i>may</i> be applied to females,\" (emphasis added), which immediately precedes the definition of \"person,\" and stated:</p>\n        <p>\"The only object [of the Act] is to get rid of a great deal of verbosity in our statutes by providing that when the word 'he' is used it <i>shall</i> include females as well as males.\"  Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871) (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p>Thus, in Trumbull's view the word \"may\" meant \"shall.\"  Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is also required for it to perform its intended function to be a guide to \"rules of construction\" of Acts of Congress.  See <i>ibid.</i> (remarks of Sen. Trumbull).  Were the defined words \"allowable, [but] not mandatory\" constructions, as <i>Monroe</i> suggests, there would be no \"rules\" at all.  Instead, Congress must have intended the definitions of the Act to apply across-the-board except where the Act by its terms called for a deviation from this practice&#8212;\"[where] the context shows that [defined] words were to be used in a more limited sense.\" Certainly this is how the <i>Northwestern Fertilizing</i> court viewed the matter.  Since there is nothing in the \"context\" of &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word \"person,\" the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include \"bodies politic\" among the entities that could be sued.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn54\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54_ref\">54</a>\n        <p> There is certainly no constitutional impediment to municipal liability.  \"The Tenth Amendment's reservation of nondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal-court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Milliken v.

Settled state practice  . . .  can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not writ an empty formalism into the Constitution.  Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn57\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57_ref\">57</a>\n        <p> Support for such a conclusion can be found in the legislative history.  As we have indicated, there is virtually no discussion of &#167; 1 of the Civil Rights Act.  Again, however, Congress' treatment of the Sherman amendment gives a clue to whether it would have desired to impose <i>respondeat superior</i> liability.</p>\n        <p>The primary constitutional justification for the Sherman amendment was that it was a necessary and proper remedy for the failure of localities to protect citizens as the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required.  See <i>supra</i>, at 670-673.  And according to Sherman, Shellabarger, and Edmunds, the amendment came into play only when a locality was at fault or had knowingly neglected its duty to provide protection. See Globe 761 (Sen. Sherman);  <i>id.,</i> at 756 (Sen. Edmunds);  <i>id.,</i> at 751-752 (Rep. Shellabarger).  But other proponents of the amendment apparently viewed it as a form of vicarious liability for the unlawful acts of the citizens of the locality.  See <i>id.,</i> at 792 (Rep. Butler).  And whether intended or not, the amendment as drafted did impose a species of vicarious liability on municipalities since it could be construed to impose liability even if a municipality did not know of an impending or ensuing riot or did not have the wherewithal to do anything about it. Indeed, the amendment held a municipality liable even if it had done everything in its power to curb the riot.  See <i>supra</i>, at 668; Globe 761 (Sen. Stevenson);  <i>id.,</i> at 771 (Sen. Thurman);  <i>id.,</i> at 788 (Rep. Kerr);  <i>id.,</i> at 791 (Rep. Willard).  While the first conference substitute was rejected principally on constitutional grounds see <i>id.,</i> at 804 (Rep. Poland), it is plain from the text of the second conference substitute&#8212;which limited liability to those who, having the power to intervene against Ku Klux Klan violence, \"neglect[ed] or refuse[d] so to do,\" see Appendix to this opinion, <i>infra,</i> at 704, and which was enacted as &#167; 6 of the 1871 Act and is now codified as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1986&#8212;that Congress also rejected those elements of vicarious liability contained in the first conference substitute even while accepting the basic principle that the inhabitants of a community were bound to provide protection against the Ku Klux Klan.  Strictly speaking, of course, the fact that Congress refused to impose vicarious liability for the wrongs of a few private citizens does not conclusively establish that it would similarly have refused to impose vicarious liability for the torts of a municipality's employees.  Nonetheless, when Congress' rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in &#167; 1983 which can easily be construed to create <i>respondeat superior</i> liability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn58\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58_ref\">58</a>\n        <p> A third justification, often cited but which on examination is apparently insufficient to justify the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior,</i> see, <i>e. g.,</i> 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, &#167; 26.3, is that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor.  By our decision in <i>Rizzo v.

In &#167; 718 of the Act, 86 Stat. 369, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1617 (1976 ed.), Congress gave its explicit approval to the institution of federal desegregation suits against school boards presumably under &#167; 1983.

The Court of Appeals affirmed for the same reason.  272 F.2d 365-366 (CA7 1959).</p>\n        <p>Petitioners in this Court also offered an alternative argument that the city of Chicago was a \"person\" for purposes of &#167; 1983, Brief for Petitioners, O.T.1960, No. 39, p. 25, but the underlying theory of municipal liability remained one of <i>respondeat superior</i>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> advances two important values of a rational system of law: (i) the certainty of legal principles and (ii) the wisdom of the conservative vision that existing rules should be presumed rational and not subject to modification \"at any time a new thought seems appealing,\" dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist, <i>post</i>, at 718; cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law 36 (1881). But, at the same time, the law has recognized the necessity of change, lest rules \"simply persis[t] from blind imitation of the past.\" Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). Any overruling of prior precedent, whether of a constitutional decision or otherwise, disserves to some extent the value of certainty. But I think we owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations. That is the premise of the canon of interpretation that language in a decision not necessary to the holding may be accorded less weight in subsequent cases. I also would recognize the fact that until this case the Court has not had to confront squarely the consequences of holding &#167; 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.</p>\n        <p>Of course, the mere fact that an issue was not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding. <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), cited by the dissent, <i>post,</i> at 718, is a case in point. But the Court's recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in <i>Marbury</i>. And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the <i>Marbury</i> holding. In <i>Monroe</i>, on the other hand, the Court's rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner. The language in <i>Monroe</i> cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding &#167; 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies. It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today's re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In <i>Aldinger v. Howard,</i> 427 U.S. 1, 16, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 2421, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976), we reaffirmed <i>Monroe,</i> but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of &#167; 1983 under <i>Monroe</i>, and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim.  Similarly, the parties in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in <i>Monroe</i>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested.  There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Mr. Justice REHNQUIST's dissent makes a strong argument that \"[s]ince <i>Monroe,</i> municipalities <i>have</i> had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights.\"  <i>Post,</i> at 717.  But it reasonably may be assumed that most municipalities already indemnify officials sued for conduct within the scope of their authority, a policy that furthers the important interest of attracting and retaining competent officers, board members, and employees.  In any event, the possibility of a qualified immunity, as to which the Court reserves decision, may remove some of the harshness of liability for good-faith failure to predict the often uncertain course of constitutional adjudication.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As we pointed out in <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 278-279, 97 S.Ct. 568, 571-572, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under &#167; 1983 is \"jurisdictional\" for purposes of invoking 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1343, even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.  See <i>Bell v. Hood,</i> 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The other statutes cited by the Court, <i>ante</i>, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of &#167; 1983, but refer generally to suits against \"a local educational agency.\"  As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F.2d 259, 264-266, such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either &#167; 1983 or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages. Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of <i>Monroe,</i> my Brother Powell relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that \"the exercise of &#167; 1983 jurisdiction  . . .  [was] perhaps not premised on considered holdings.\"  <i>Ante,</i> at 711.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It has not been generally thought, before today, that &#167; 1983 provided an avenue of relief from unconstitutional takings. Those federal courts which have granted compensation against state and local governments have resorted to an implied right of action under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  <i>Richmond Elks Hall Assn. v. Richmond Redevelopment Agency,</i> 561 F.2d 1327 (CA9 1977), aff'g 389 F.Supp. 486 (N.D.Cal.1975);  <i>Foster v. City of Detroit,</i> 405 F.2d 138, 140 (CA6 1968).  Since the Court today abandons the holding of <i>Monroe</i> chiefly on the strength of Bingham's arguments, it is indeed anomalous that &#167; 1983 will provide relief only when a local government, not the State itself, seizes private property. See <i>ante,</i> at 690 n. 54;  <i>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,</i> 427 U.S. 445, 452, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 4  L.Ed.2d 614 (1976);  <i>Edelman v.
