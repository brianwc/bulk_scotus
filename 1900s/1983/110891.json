The complaint also alleged that the action arose under the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10741(a), and that the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court dismissed the matter for want of subject matter jurisdiction and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  682 F.2d 811 (1982).

There is no support for this novel interpretation in <i>Rice</i> or elsewhere.  That the consignee attempted to avoid payment by invoking an estoppel defense is an accurate enough portrayal of the facts, but does not obscure that the claim arose under federal law.  \"As to interstate shipments,\" the Court stated, \"the parties are held to the responsibilities imposed by the federal law, to the exclusion of all other rules of obligation.\"  247 U.S., at 202, 38 S.Ct., at 429.
