Petitioners in No. 48, respondents in No. 49, later referred to as \"claimants,\" are bankers of Budapest who had a checking account with Knauth, Nachod &amp; Kuhne, the bankrupts, On June 15, 1923, they procured a credit with the bankrupts through the deposit with the latter by the National City Bank of New York of its cashier's check, payable to the bankrupts' order, \"favor N.

The proceeds of collection are traced into the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy and the present proceedings were brought for their reclamation in the district court for southern New York. The petition was dismissed. The court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the order of the district court as to the National City Bank check and affirmed it as to that of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. <i>In re Gubelman,</i> 10 Fed. (2d) 926, holding that the words in the former, \"favor N. Latzko and A.

The distinction seems to us to require no difference in result where, as here, the check was treated by the bankrupts as current funds and at once placed to the credit of the claimants. It is suggested also that, although it was the practice of the bankrupts to credit checks to claimants as soon as deposited, it does not affirmatively appear that claimants asked or expected them to be credited in advance of collection, or that the items were listed as immediately entitled to interest.

We cannot assume, in the absence of proof, that claimants, whose controlling purpose was to secure a credit with Knauth, Nachod &amp; Kuhne, were unwilling to accept the credit, when given, because it anticipated the collection of the paper by twenty-four hours. There is then no basis for the distinctions attempted, and this case is controlled by our decision in No. 34. Considering the checks in the light most favorable to claimants, as though the language relied on appeared on the face of both checks, claimants are nevertheless only general creditors of the bankrupts and their petition was rightly denied by the district court. The judgment of the district court is affirmed and that of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and</p>\n<p><i>Reversed in part.</i></p>\n</div>",
