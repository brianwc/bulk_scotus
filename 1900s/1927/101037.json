The evidence with respect to capital invested by individuals, taken as a whole, falls short of establishing that the capital thus used is employed substantially as in the loan and investment features of banking in making investments by way of loan or discount or in notes, bonds and other securities, with a view to sale or repayment and reinvestment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals of Kentucky, following the state practice, reviewed the evidence, concluding from it that \"no material part of the capital held by the individuals is so invested as to come in competition with the national banks.\"</p>\n<p>The evidence is set forth in the record.

In the course of the opinion the Court of Appeals gave more attention than we think justified to the difference between short-time and long-time loans and to the readiness with which the banks obtain loans, notwithstanding the competition alleged, but even after making due allowance for this we think the finding should not be disturbed.
