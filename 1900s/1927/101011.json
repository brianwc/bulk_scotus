The interlocutory decree was granted upon the bill and affidavits presented by both sides. No answer has been filed. In these circumstances we only consider whether the judicial discretion of the trial court was improperly exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents claimed below and maintain here that enforcement of the challenged act would deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment. Petitioners insist that the entire act and the regulations adopted thereunder are valid; that they prescribe lawful rules for the conduct of private foreign language schools necessary for the public welfare; also that, if any provision of the statute transcends the power of the Legislature, it should be disregarded and the remaining ones should be enforced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the enactment is subject to the asserted objections it is not here seriously questioned that respondents are entitled to the relief granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are 163 foreign language schools in the territory. Nine are conducted in the Korean language, 7 in the Chinese, and the remainder in the Japanese. Respondents are members of numerous voluntary unincorporated associations conducting foreign language schools for instruction of Japanese children. These are owned, maintained and conducted by upwards of 5,000 persons, the property used in connection therewith is worth $250,000, the enrolled pupils number 20,000, and 300 teachers are employed. These schools receive no aid from public funds. All children residing within the territory are required to attend some public or equivalent school, and practically all who go to foreign language schools also attend public or such private schools. It is affirmed by counsel for petitioners that Japanese pupils in the public and equivalent private schools increased from 1,320 in 1900 to 19,354 in 1920, and that out of a total of 65,369 pupils of all races on December 31, 1924, 30,487 were Japanese.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged enactment declares that the term 'foreign language school,' as used therein, 'shall be construed to mean any school which is conducted in any language other than the English language or Hawaiian language, except Sabbath schools.'

He does not disavow purpose to enforce all provisions of the challenged act and regulations. An affidavit by the superintendent of public instruction advances the opinion that respondents could pay the prescribed fees, that compliance with the foreign language school laws would not prevent the operation of schools which conduct kindergartens, and that elimination of the kindergartens would not materially affect them. Also he says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That instruction in said Japanese language schools is not      and cannot be confined to the speaking, reading and writing      of the Japanese language, but extends to many subjects and      even in so far as it is intended to have for its object the      speaking, reading and writing of said language, the teaching      of that is and must be largely through the medium of stories      whether of history or fiction and in other ways than the mere      teaching of letters and words and sentences. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That, in the opinion of this affiant, the parents of      children will not because of the provisions of said Act 152      be afraid to pay tuition fees nor will other persons be      afraid to contribute to the funds of such schools and this      affiant denies that said schools will, unless immediate      relief is afforded by this honorable court, be unable to pay the teachers' salaries and the expenses of conducting      said schools, and denies that the property of plaintiffs in      said schools will be utterly or at all destroyed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing statement is enough to show that the School Act and the measures adopted thereunder go far beyond mere regulation of privately supported schools, where children obtain instruction deemed valuable by their parents and which is not obviously in conflict with any public interest. They give affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, intrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum and text-books. Enforcement of the act probably would destroy most, if not all, of them; and, certainly, it would deprive parents of fair opportunity to procure for their children instruction which they think important and we cannot say is harmful. The Japanese parent has the right to direct the education of his own child without unreasonable restrictions; the Constitution protects him as well as those who speak another tongue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the record and the arguments presented, we cannot undertake to consider the validity of each separate provision of the act and decide whether, dissociated from the others, its enforcement would violate respondents' constitutional rights. Apparently all are parts of a deliberate plan to bring foreign language schools under a strict governmental control for which the record discloses no adequate reason. Here, the enactment has been defended as a whole. No effort has been made to discuss the validity of the several provisions. In the trial court the cause proceeded upon the theory that petitioners intended to enforce all of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general doctrine touching rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to owners, parents and children in respect of attendance upon schools has been announced in recent opinions.

The interlocutory decree was granted upon the bill and affidavits presented by both sides. No answer has been filed. In these circumstances we only consider whether the judicial discretion of the trial court was improperly exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents claimed below and maintain here that enforcement of the challenged act would deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment. Petitioners insist that the entire act and the regulations adopted thereunder are valid; that they prescribe lawful rules for the conduct of private foreign language schools necessary for the public welfare; also that, if any provision of the statute transcends the power of the Legislature, it should be disregarded and the remaining ones should be enforced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the enactment is subject to the asserted objections it is not here seriously questioned that respondents are entitled to the relief granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are 163 foreign language schools in the territory. Nine are conducted in the Korean language, 7 in the Chinese, and the remainder in the Japanese. Respondents are members of numerous voluntary unincorporated associations conducting foreign language schools for instruction of Japanese children. These are owned, maintained and conducted by upwards of 5,000 persons, the property used in connection therewith is worth $250,000, the enrolled pupils number 20,000, and 300 teachers are employed. These schools receive no aid from public funds. All children residing within the territory are required to attend some public or equivalent school, and practically all who go to foreign language schools also attend public or such private schools. It is affirmed by counsel for petitioners that Japanese pupils in the public and equivalent private schools increased from 1,320 in 1900 to 19,354 in 1920, and that out of a total of 65,369 pupils of all races on December 31, 1924, 30,487 were Japanese.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged enactment declares that the term 'foreign language school,' as used therein, 'shall be construed to mean any school which is conducted in any language other than the English language or Hawaiian language, except Sabbath schools.' And, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the following are its more prominent and questionable features:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'No such school shall be conducted in the territory unless      under a written permit therefor from the department of public      instruction, nor unless the fee therefor shall have been paid      as therein provided, and such permit shall be kept exposed in      a prominent place at the school so as to be readily seen and      read by visitors thereat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The fee prescribed is one dollar per pupil on the estimated      average attendance of pupils at the school during the period during which such school was conducted during the      next preceding school year, or if such school was not      conducted during any part of such preceding school year, then      at the same rate at the estimated average attendance during      the school year or unexpired part thereof in question, in      which latter case the amount shall be adjusted to conform to      the estimated average attendance during such year or part      thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The amount of the fee shall be estimated and determined by      the department from such information as it may have, and      shall be payable by any person, persons or corporation      conducting or participating in conducting such school; and      all officers, teachers and all members of any committee or      governing board of any such school, and in case such school      is conducted by or for a corporation or voluntary association      or other group of persons, all members or associates of such      corporation, association or group shall be deemed to be      participants in conducting such school.

No permit to teach in a      foreign language school shall be granted unless and until the      department is satisfied that the applicant for the same is      possessed of the ideals of democracy, knowledge of American      history and institutions, and knows how to read, write, and      speak the English language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is the declared object of the act to fully and      effectively regulate the conducting of foreign language      schools and the teaching of foreign languages, in order that      the Americanism of the pupils may be promoted, and the      department is directed to carry out the provisions of the act      in accordance with its spirit and purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Before issuing a permit to conduct a foreign language school      or to teach in any such school the department shall require      the applicant for such permit to sign a pledge that the      applicant will, if granted a permit to teach in such a      school, abide by and observe the terms of the act, and the      regulations, and orders of the department, and will, to the      best of his ability, so direct the minds and studies of      pupils in such schools as will tend to make them good and loyal American citizens, and will not permit such      students to receive instructions in any way inconsistent      therewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'No foreign language school shall be conducted in the morning      before the school hours of the public schools or during the      hours while the public schools are in session, nor shall any      pupil attend any foreign language school for more than one      hour each day, nor exceeding six hours in any one week, nor      exceeding thirty-eight weeks in any school year: Provided,      however, the department may, in its discretion and with the      approval of the Governor, modify this provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The department shall have full power from time to time to      prescribe by regulations the subjects and courses of study of      all foreign language schools, and the entrance and attendance      prerequisites or qualifications of education, age, school      attainment, demonstrated mental capacity, health and      otherwise, and the text-books used in any foreign language      school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Until otherwise provided by the department, the following      regulations are in effect: Up to September 1, 1923, every      pupil shall have first satisfactorily completed the American      public school first grade, or a course equivalent thereto,      before attending or being allowed to attend any foreign      language school.

He does not disavow purpose to enforce all provisions of the challenged act and regulations. An affidavit by the superintendent of public instruction advances the opinion that respondents could pay the prescribed fees, that compliance with the foreign language school laws would not prevent the operation of schools which conduct kindergartens, and that elimination of the kindergartens would not materially affect them. Also he says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That instruction in said Japanese language schools is not      and cannot be confined to the speaking, reading and writing      of the Japanese language, but extends to many subjects and      even in so far as it is intended to have for its object the      speaking, reading and writing of said language, the teaching      of that is and must be largely through the medium of stories      whether of history or fiction and in other ways than the mere      teaching of letters and words and sentences. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That, in the opinion of this affiant, the parents of      children will not because of the provisions of said Act 152      be afraid to pay tuition fees nor will other persons be      afraid to contribute to the funds of such schools and this      affiant denies that said schools will, unless immediate      relief is afforded by this honorable court, be unable to pay the teachers' salaries and the expenses of conducting      said schools, and denies that the property of plaintiffs in      said schools will be utterly or at all destroyed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing statement is enough to show that the School Act and the measures adopted thereunder go far beyond mere regulation of privately supported schools, where children obtain instruction deemed valuable by their parents and which is not obviously in conflict with any public interest. They give affirmative direction concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, intrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum and text-books. Enforcement of the act probably would destroy most, if not all, of them; and, certainly, it would deprive parents of fair opportunity to procure for their children instruction which they think important and we cannot say is harmful. The Japanese parent has the right to direct the education of his own child without unreasonable restrictions; the Constitution protects him as well as those who speak another tongue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the record and the arguments presented, we cannot undertake to consider the validity of each separate provision of the act and decide whether, dissociated from the others, its enforcement would violate respondents' constitutional rights. Apparently all are parts of a deliberate plan to bring foreign language schools under a strict governmental control for which the record discloses no adequate reason. Here, the enactment has been defended as a whole. No effort has been made to discuss the validity of the several provisions. In the trial court the cause proceeded upon the theory that petitioners intended to enforce all of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general doctrine touching rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to owners, parents and children in respect of attendance upon schools has been announced in recent opinions. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042, 29 A. L. R. 1446; Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U. S. 404, 43 S. Ct. 628, 67 L. Ed. 1047; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070, 39 A. L. R. 468. While that amendment declares that no state shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' the inhibition of the Fifth Amendment, 'No person shall * * * be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' applies to the federal government and agencies set up by Congress for the government of the territory. Those fundamental rights of the individual which the cited cases declared were protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the states, are guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment against action by the territorial Legislature or officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, of course, appreciate the grave problems incident to the large alien population of the Hawaiian Islands. These should be given due weight whenever the validity of any governmental regulation of private schools is under consideration; but the limitations of the Constitution must not be transcended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems proper to add that when petitioners present their answer the issues may become more specific and permit the cause to be dealt with in greater detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no abuse of the discretion lodged in the trial court.
