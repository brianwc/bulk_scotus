The declaration is long and suggests throughout an effort to state a case under the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94; 40 Stat. 1272; and to account for this suit by the fact that the plaintiffs' claim under that Act was disallowed.

But this suit is against a corporation of the State of Washington, brought originally in a Court of Oregon to enforce a supposed liability in contract. Even if a statute of the United States created a bar, it would be unusual if the act went to the jurisdiction rather than to the merits, <i>Fauntleroy</i> v. <i>Lum,</i> 210 U.S. 230, 235; and if the statute went further it would be more likely to exclude jurisdiction in all other Courts rather than merely in Courts of the United States as such. If the statute excluded jurisdiction in State as well as United States Courts the case could not be certified under \u00a7 238 of the Judicial Code. <i>Fore River Shipbuilding Co.</i> v. <i>Hagg,</i> 219 U.S. 175, 178. But the Dent Act does not contemplate suits against corporations in the Court of Claims, and we perceive no ground for the ruling as certified. It well may be that the Court was right in deciding that the allegations were not sufficient to justify a suit against the corporation, and our judgment is without prejudice to a judgment dismissing the case upon the merits. But it was error to decide that there was a want of jurisdiction and therefore the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",
