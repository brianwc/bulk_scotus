Shortly given the alleged facts follow. Petitioner, a duly licensed and registered physician, without an official written order therefor, knowingly, willfully and unlawfully did sell, barter and give to Ida Casey one tablet of morphine and three tablets of cocaine; he knew she was addicted to habitual use of these drugs and did not require administration of either because of any disease other than such addiction, and he did not dispense them for the treatment of any other disease or condition; they were not administered by him or by any nurse or other person acting under his direction, nor were they consumed or intended for consumption in his presence; the amount was more than sufficient to satisfy the recipient's cravings if wholly consumed at one time; petitioner put the drugs into her possession expecting that she would administer them to herself in divided doses over a period of time; they were in the form in which addicts usually consume them to satisfy their cravings; the recipient was in no way prevented or restrained from disposing of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner maintains that the facts stated are not sufficient to constitute an offense. The United States submit that, considering United States v. Behrman, 258 U. S. 280, 42 S. Ct. 303, 66 L. Ed. 619, the sufficiency of the indictment is clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The trial court charged:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that      defendant knew that this woman was addicted to the use of      narcotics, and if he dispensed these drugs to her for the      purpose of catering to her appetite or satisfying her      cravings for the drug, he is guilty under the law. If, on the      other hand, you believe from the testimony that the defendant      believed in good faith this woman was suffering from cancer      or ulcer of the stomach, and administered the drug for the      purpose of relieving her pain, or if you entertain a      reasonable doubt upon that question, you must give the      defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, the indictment alleges that the accused, a duly registered physician, violated the statute by giving to a known addict four tablets containing morphine and cocaine with the expectation that she would administer them to herself in divided doses, while unrestrained and beyond his presence or control, for the sole purpose of relieving conditions incident to addiction and keeping herself comfortable. It does not question the doctor's good faith nor the wisdom or propriety of his action according to medical standards. It does not allege that he dispensed the drugs otherwise than to a patient in the course of his professional practice or for other than medical purposes. The facts disclosed indicate no conscious design to violate the law, no cause to suspect that the recipient intended to sell or otherwise dispose of the drugs, and no real probability that she would not consume them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declared object of the Narcotic Law is to provide revenue, and this court has held that whatever additional moral end it may have in view must 'be reached only through a revenue measure and within the limits of a revenue measure.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 402, 36 S. Ct. 658, 60 L. Ed. 1061, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854. Congress cannot, under the pretext of executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the federal government. And we accept as established doctrine that any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power, but solely to the achievement of something plainly within power reserved to the states, is invalid and cannot be enforced. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat, 316 423, 4 L. Ed. 579; License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 18 L. Ed. 497; United States v. De Witt, 9 Wall. 41, 19 L. Ed. 593; Keller v. United States, 213 U. S. 138, 29 S. Ct. 470, 53 L. Ed. 737, 16 Ann. Cas. 1066; Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 38 S. Ct. 529, 62 L. Ed. 1101, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724; Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 42 S. Ct. 449, 66 L. Ed. 817. In the light of these principles, and not forgetting the familiar rule that 'a statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid, not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score,' the provisions of this statute must be interpreted and applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a revenue measure. The enactment under consideration levies a tax, upheld by this court, upon every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses or gives away opium or coca leaves or derivatives therefrom, and may regulate medical practice in the states only so far as reasonably appropriate for or merely incidental to its enforcement. It says nothing of 'addicts' and does not undertake to prescribe methods for their medical treatment. They are diseased and proper subjects for such treatment, and we cannot possibly conclude that a physician acted improperly or unwisely or for other than medical purposes solely because he has dispensed to one of them in the ordinary course and in good faith, four small tablets of morphine or cocaine for relief of conditions incident to addiction. What constitutes bona fide medical practice must be determined upon consideration of evidence and attending circumstances. Mere pretense of such practice, of course, cannot legalize forbidden sales, or otherwise nullify valid provisions of the statute, or defeat such regulations as may be fairly appropriate to its enforcement within the proper limitations of a revenue measure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra, points out that the Narcotic Law can be upheld only as a revenue measure. It must be interpreted and applied accordingly. Further, grave constitutional doubts concerning section 8 cannot be avoided unless limited to persons who are required to register by section 1. Mere possession of the drug creates no presumption of guilt as against any other person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86, 93, 95, 39 S. Ct. 214, 63 L. Ed. 493, a registered physician was accused of unlawfully selling, giving away and distributing 500 one-sixth grain tablets of heroin without official written order. Another count charged selling, dispensing and distributing 500 such tablets not in the course of regular professional practice. The trial court held section 2 invalid because it invaded the police power of the state. This court declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Of course Congress may not in the exercise of federal power      exert authority wholly reserved to the states. * * * If the      legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the      exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the      Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the      supposed motives which induced it. * * * We cannot agree with      the contention that the provisions of section 2, controlling      the disposition of these drugs in the ways described, can      have nothing to do with facilitating the collection of the      revenue, as we should be obliged to do if we were to declare      this act beyond the power of Congress acting under its      constitutional authority to impose excise taxes.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sharp division of the court in this cause and the opinion in Jin Fuey Moy's Case clearly indicated that the statute must be strictly construed and not extended beyond the proper limits of a revenue measure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webb v. United States, 249 U. S. 96, 99, 39 S. Ct. 217, 63 L. Ed. 497, came here on certified questions. Two were answered upon authority of Doremus' Case. The third inquired whether a regular physician's order for morphine issued to an addict, not in the course or professional treatment with design to cure the habit, but in order to provide enough of the drug to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is a 'physicians prescription.' The answer was that 'to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a pervision of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.' The lower court had sought instruction in order that it might decide the particular cause. The question specified no definite quantity of drugs, nor the time intended for their use. The narrated facts show, plainly enough, that physician and druggist conspired to sell large quantities of morphine to addicts under the guise of issuing and filling orders. The so-called prescriptions were issued without consideration of individual cases and for the quantities of the drugs which applicants desired for the continuation of customary use. The answer thus given must not be construed as forbidding every prescription for drugs, irrespective of quantity, when designed temporarily to alleviate an addict's pains, although it may have been issued in good faith and without design to defeat the revenues. This limitation of the reply is confirmed by Behrman's Case, 258 U. S. 280, 42 S. Ct. 303, 66 L. Ed. 619, infra, decided three years later, which suggests at least that the accused doctor might have lawfully dispensed some doses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Jin Fuey Moy v.

Shortly given the alleged facts follow: Petitioner, a duly licensed and registered physician, without an official written order therefor, knowingly, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> wilfully and unlawfully did sell, barter and give to Ida Casey one tablet of morphine and three tablets of cocaine; he knew she was addicted to habitual use of these drugs and did not require administration of either because of any disease other than such addiction, and he did not dispense them for the treatment of any other disease or condition; they were not administered by him or by any nurse or other person acting under his direction, nor were they consumed or intended for consumption in his presence; the amount was more than sufficient to satisfy the recipient's cravings if wholly consumed at one time; petitioner put the drugs into her possession expecting that she would administer them to herself in divided doses over a period of time; they were in the form in which addicts usually consume them to satisfy their cravings; the recipient was in no way prevented or restrained from disposing of them.</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains that the facts stated are not sufficient to constitute an offense. The United States submit that, considering <i>United States</i> v. <i>Behrman,</i> 258 U.S. 280, the sufficiency of the indictment is clear.</p>\n<p>The trial court charged </p>\n<p>\"If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that this woman was addicted to the use of narcotics, and if he dispensed these drugs to her for the purpose of catering to her appetite or satisfying her cravings for the drug, he is guilty under the law. If, on the other hand, you believe from the testimony that the defendant believed in good faith this woman was suffering from cancer or ulcer of the stomach, and administered the drug for the purpose of relieving her pain, or if you entertain a reasonable doubt upon that question, you must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\"</p>\n<p>In effect, the indictment alleges that the accused, a duly registered physician, violated the statute by giving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> to a known addict four tablets containing morphine and cocaine with the expectation that she would administer them to herself in divided doses, while unrestrained and beyond his presence or control, for the sole purpose of relieving conditions incident to addiction and keeping herself comfortable. It does not question the doctor's good faith nor the wisdom or propriety of his action according to medical standards. It does not allege that he dispensed the drugs otherwise than to a patient in the course of his professional practice or for other than medical purposes. The facts disclosed indicate no conscious design to violate the law, no cause to suspect that the recipient intended to sell or otherwise dispose of the drugs, and no real probability that she would not consume them.</p>\n<p>The declared object of the Narcotic Law is to provide revenue, and this court has held that whatever additional moral end it may have in view must \"be reached only through a revenue measure and within the limits of a revenue measure.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy,</i> 241 U.S. 394, 402. Congress cannot, under the pretext of executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to the Federal Government. And we accept as established doctrine that any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power but solely to the achievement of something plainly within power reserved to the States, is invalid and cannot be enforced. <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 423; <i>License Tax Cases,</i> 5 Wall. 462; <i>United States</i> v. <i>DeWitt,</i> 9 Wall. 41; <i>Keller</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 213 U.S. 138; <i>Hammer</i> v. <i>Dagenhart,</i> 247 U.S. 251; <i>Child Labor Tax Case,</i> 259 U.S. 20. In the light of these principles and not forgetting the familiar rule, that \"a statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score,\" the provisions of this statute must be interpreted and applied.</p>\n<p>Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the States is beyond the power of the Federal Government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a revenue measure. The enactment under consideration levies a tax, upheld by this court, upon every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses or gives away opium or coca leaves or derivatives therefrom, and may regulate medical practice in the States only so far as reasonably appropriate for or merely incidental to its enforcement. It says nothing of \"addicts\" and does not undertake to prescribe methods for their medical treatment. They are diseased and proper subjects for such treatment, and we cannot possibly conclude that a physician acted improperly or unwisely or for other than medical purposes solely because he has dispensed to one of them, in the ordinary course and in good faith, four small tablets of morphine or cocaine for relief of conditions incident to addiction. What constitutes <i>bona fide</i> medical practice must be determined upon consideration of evidence and attending circumstances. Mere pretense of such practice, of course, cannot legalize forbidden sales, or otherwise nullify valid provisions of the statute, or defeat such regulations as may be fairly appropriate to its enforcement within the proper limitations of a revenue measure.</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy, supra</i><i>,</i> points out that the Narcotic Law can be upheld only as a revenue measure. It must be interpreted and applied accordingly. Further, grave constitutional doubts concerning § 8 cannot be avoided unless limited to persons who are required to register by § 1. Mere possession of the drug creates no presumption of guilt as against any other person.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Doremus,</i> 249 U.S. 86, 93, 95, a registered physician was accused of unlawfully selling, giving away and distributing five hundred one-sixth grain tablets of heroin without official written order. Another count charged selling, dispensing and distributing five hundred such tablets not in the course of regular professional practice. The trial court held § 2 invalid because it invaded the police power of the State. This court declared: \"Of course Congress may not in the exercise of federal power exert authority wholly reserved to the States. . . . If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it. . . . We cannot agree with the contention that the provisions of § 2, controlling the disposition of these drugs in the ways described, can have nothing to do with facilitating the collection of the revenue, as we should be obliged to do if we were to declare this Act beyond the power of Congress acting under its constitutional authority to impose excise taxes.\" The sharp division of the court in this cause and the opinion in <i>Jin Fuey Moy's Case</i> clearly indicated that the statute must be strictly construed and not extended beyond the proper limits of a revenue measure.</p>\n<p><i>Webb</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 249 U.S. 96, 99, came here on certified questions. Two were answered upon authority of <i>Doremus' Case.</i> The third inquired whether a regular physician's order for morphine issued to an addict, not in the course of professional treatment with design to cure the habit, but in order to provide enough of the drug to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is a \"physician's prescription.\" The answer was that \"to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.\" The lower <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> court had sought instruction in order that it might decide the particular cause. The question specified no definite quantity of drugs, nor the time intended for their use. The narrated facts show, plainly enough, that physician and druggist conspired to sell large quantities of morphine to addicts under the guise of issuing and filling orders. The so-called prescriptions were issued without consideration of individual cases and for the quantities of the drugs which applicants desired for the continuation of customary use. The answer thus given must not be construed as forbidding every prescription for drugs, irrespective of quantity, when designed temporarily to alleviate an addict's pains, although it may have been issued in good faith and without design to defeat the revenues. This limitation of the reply is confirmed by <i>Behrman's Case,</i> 258 U.S. 280, (<i>infra</i>) decided three years later, which suggests at least that the accused doctor might have lawfully dispensed some doses.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 254 U.S. 189, 194, doctor and druggist conspired to sell opiates. The prescriptions were not issued in the course of professional practice. The doctor became party to prohibited sales. \"Manifestly the phrases `to a patient' and `in the course of his professional practice only' are intended to confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the Act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A `prescription' issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it.\"</p>\n<p>The quoted language must be confined to circumstances like those presented by the cause. In reality, the doctor became party to sales of drugs. He received a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> fixed sum per dram under guise of issuing prescriptions. The quoted words are repeated in <i>Behrman's Case,</i> which recognizes the possible propriety of prescribing small quantities.</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint,</i> 258, U.S. 250, 253, 254, holds  \"It is very evident from a reading of it [§ 2] that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic.\"</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Behrman,</i> 258 U.S. 280, 287, came up under the Criminal Appeals Act. The indictment charged that Behrman, a registered physician, did unlawfully sell, barter and give to one King, an \"addict,\" one hundred and fifty grains of heroin, three hundred and sixty grains of morphine and two hundred and ten grains of cocaine, by issuing three prescriptions. Further, that the drugs were not intended or required for treatment of any disease or condition other than such addiction, but for self-administration over a period of several days. The question was, \"Do the acts charged in this indictment constitute an offense within the meaning of the statute?\" And replying, this court said </p>\n<p>\"The District Judge who heard this case was of the opinion that prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such quantity to addicts as charged in the indictment. . . . In our opinion the District Judge who heard the case was right in his conclusion and should have overruled the demurrer. Former decisions of this court have held that the purpose of the exception is to confine the distribution of these drugs to the regular and lawful course of professional practice, and that not everything called a prescription is necessarily such. [<i>Webb</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> <i>United States</i> and <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i> v. <i>United States, supra</i><i>,</i> are cited.] . . . It may be admitted that to prescribe a single dose, or even a number of doses, may not bring a physician within the penalties of the Act; but what is here charged is that the defendant physician by means of prescriptions has enabled one, known by him to be an addict, to obtain from a pharmacist the enormous number of doses contained in 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine\"  three thousand ordinary doses!</p>\n<p>This opinion related to definitely alleged facts and must be so understood. The enormous quantity of drugs ordered, considered in connection with the recipient's character, without explanation, seemed enough to show prohibited sales and to exclude the idea of <i>bona fide</i> professional action in the ordinary course. The opinion cannot be accepted as authority for holding that a physician, who, acts <i>bona fide</i> and according to fair medical standards, may never give an addict moderate amounts of drugs for self-administration in order to relieve conditions incident to addiction. Enforcement of the tax demands no such drastic rule, and if the Act had such scope it would certainly encounter grave constitutional difficulties.</p>\n<p>The Narcotic Law is essentially a revenue measure and its provisions must be reasonably applied with the primary view of enforcing the special tax. We find no facts alleged in the indictment sufficient to show that petitioner had done anything falling within definite inhibitions or sufficient materially to imperil orderly collection of revenue from sales. Federal power is delegated, and its prescribed limits must not be transcended even though the end seem desirable. The unfortunate condition of the recipient certainly created no reasonable probability that she would sell or otherwise dispose of the few tablets entrusted to her; and we cannot say that by so dispensing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> them the doctor necessarily transcended the limits of that professional conduct with which Congress never intended to interfere.</p>\n<p>The judgment below must be reversed.

Contrary to the form of the state in such case made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>The Harrison Narcotic Law, approved Dec. 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785  twelve sections  is entitled: \"An Act to provide for the registration of, with collectors of internal revenue, and to impose a special tax upon all persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away opium or coca leaves, their salts, derivatives, or preparations, and for other purposes.\"</p>\n<p>Sec. 1 provides  \"That on and after the first day of March, nineteen hundred and fifteen, every person [with exceptions not here important] who produces, imports, manufactures, compounds, deals in, dispenses, sells, distributes, or gives away opium or coca leaves or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation thereof, shall register with the Collector of Internal Revenue,\" and shall pay a special annual tax of one dollar.

Shortly given the alleged facts follow: Petitioner, a duly licensed and registered physician, without an official written order therefor, knowingly, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> wilfully and unlawfully did sell, barter and give to Ida Casey one tablet of morphine and three tablets of cocaine; he knew she was addicted to habitual use of these drugs and did not require administration of either because of any disease other than such addiction, and he did not dispense them for the treatment of any other disease or condition; they were not administered by him or by any nurse or other person acting under his direction, nor were they consumed or intended for consumption in his presence; the amount was more than sufficient to satisfy the recipient's cravings if wholly consumed at one time; petitioner put the drugs into her possession expecting that she would administer them to herself in divided doses over a period of time; they were in the form in which addicts usually consume them to satisfy their cravings; the recipient was in no way prevented or restrained from disposing of them.</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains that the facts stated are not sufficient to constitute an offense. The United States submit that, considering <i>United States</i> v. <i>Behrman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99951\"><a href=\"/opinion/99951/united-states-v-behrman/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, the sufficiency of the indictment is clear.</p>\n<p>The trial court charged </p>\n<p>\"If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that this woman was addicted to the use of narcotics, and if he dispensed these drugs to her for the purpose of catering to her appetite or satisfying her cravings for the drug, he is guilty under the law. If, on the other hand, you believe from the testimony that the defendant believed in good faith this woman was suffering from cancer or ulcer of the stomach, and administered the drug for the purpose of relieving her pain, or if you entertain a reasonable doubt upon that question, you must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\"</p>\n<p>In effect, the indictment alleges that the accused, a duly registered physician, violated the statute by giving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> to a known addict four tablets containing morphine and cocaine with the expectation that she would administer them to herself in divided doses, while unrestrained and beyond his presence or control, for the sole purpose of relieving conditions incident to addiction and keeping herself comfortable. It does not question the doctor's good faith nor the wisdom or propriety of his action according to medical standards. It does not allege that he dispensed the drugs otherwise than to a patient in the course of his professional practice or for other than medical purposes. The facts disclosed indicate no conscious design to violate the law, no cause to suspect that the recipient intended to sell or otherwise dispose of the drugs, and no real probability that she would not consume them.</p>\n<p>The declared object of the Narcotic Law is to provide revenue, and this court has held that whatever additional moral end it may have in view must \"be reached only through a revenue measure and within the limits of a revenue measure.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98755\"><a href=\"/opinion/98755/united-states-v-jin-fuey-moy/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 402. Congress cannot, under the pretext of executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to the Federal Government. And we accept as established doctrine that any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power but solely to the achievement of something plainly within power reserved to the States, is invalid and cannot be enforced. <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 423; <i>License Tax Cases,</i> 5 Wall. 462; <i>United States</i> v. <i>DeWitt,</i> 9 Wall. 41; <i>Keller</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 213 U.S. 138; <i>Hammer</i> v. <i>Dagenhart,</i> 247 U.S. 251; <i>Child Labor Tax Case,</i> 259 U.S. 20. In the light of these principles and not forgetting the familiar rule, that \"a statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score,\" the provisions of this statute must be interpreted and applied.</p>\n<p>Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the States is beyond the power of the Federal Government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a revenue measure. The enactment under consideration levies a tax, upheld by this court, upon every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses or gives away opium or coca leaves or derivatives therefrom, and may regulate medical practice in the States only so far as reasonably appropriate for or merely incidental to its enforcement. It says nothing of \"addicts\" and does not undertake to prescribe methods for their medical treatment. They are diseased and proper subjects for such treatment, and we cannot possibly conclude that a physician acted improperly or unwisely or for other than medical purposes solely because he has dispensed to one of them, in the ordinary course and in good faith, four small tablets of morphine or cocaine for relief of conditions incident to addiction. What constitutes <i>bona fide</i> medical practice must be determined upon consideration of evidence and attending circumstances. Mere pretense of such practice, of course, cannot legalize forbidden sales, or otherwise nullify valid provisions of the statute, or defeat such regulations as may be fairly appropriate to its enforcement within the proper limitations of a revenue measure.</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy, supra</i><i>,</i> points out that the Narcotic Law can be upheld only as a revenue measure. It must be interpreted and applied accordingly. Further, grave constitutional doubts concerning § 8 cannot be avoided unless limited to persons who are required to register by § 1. Mere possession of the drug creates no presumption of guilt as against any other person.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Doremus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99302\"><a href=\"/opinion/99302/united-states-v-doremus/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 93, 95, a registered physician was accused of unlawfully selling, giving away and distributing five hundred one-sixth grain tablets of heroin without official written order. Another count charged selling, dispensing and distributing five hundred such tablets not in the course of regular professional practice. The trial court held § 2 invalid because it invaded the police power of the State. This court declared: \"Of course Congress may not in the exercise of federal power exert authority wholly reserved to the States. . . . If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it. . . . We cannot agree with the contention that the provisions of § 2, controlling the disposition of these drugs in the ways described, can have nothing to do with facilitating the collection of the revenue, as we should be obliged to do if we were to declare this Act beyond the power of Congress acting under its constitutional authority to impose excise taxes.\" The sharp division of the court in this cause and the opinion in <i>Jin Fuey Moy's Case</i> clearly indicated that the statute must be strictly construed and not extended beyond the proper limits of a revenue measure.</p>\n<p><i>Webb</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99303\"><a href=\"/opinion/99303/webb-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 99, came here on certified questions. Two were answered upon authority of <i>Doremus' Case.</i> The third inquired whether a regular physician's order for morphine issued to an addict, not in the course of professional treatment with design to cure the habit, but in order to provide enough of the drug to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is a \"physician's prescription.\" The answer was that \"to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.\" The lower <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> court had sought instruction in order that it might decide the particular cause. The question specified no definite quantity of drugs, nor the time intended for their use. The narrated facts show, plainly enough, that physician and druggist conspired to sell large quantities of morphine to addicts under the guise of issuing and filling orders. The so-called prescriptions were issued without consideration of individual cases and for the quantities of the drugs which applicants desired for the continuation of customary use. The answer thus given must not be construed as forbidding every prescription for drugs, irrespective of quantity, when designed temporarily to alleviate an addict's pains, although it may have been issued in good faith and without design to defeat the revenues. This limitation of the reply is confirmed by <i>Behrman's Case,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99951\"><a href=\"/opinion/99951/united-states-v-behrman/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, (<i>infra</i>) decided three years later, which suggests at least that the accused doctor might have lawfully dispensed some doses.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99658\"><a href=\"/opinion/99658/jin-fuey-moy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 194, doctor and druggist conspired to sell opiates. The prescriptions were not issued in the course of professional practice. The doctor became party to prohibited sales. \"Manifestly the phrases `to a patient' and `in the course of his professional practice only' are intended to confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the Act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A `prescription' issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it.\"</p>\n<p>The quoted language must be confined to circumstances like those presented by the cause. In reality, the doctor became party to sales of drugs. He received a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> fixed sum per dram under guise of issuing prescriptions. The quoted words are repeated in <i>Behrman's Case,</i> which recognizes the possible propriety of prescribing small quantities.</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint,</i> 258, U.S. 250, 253, 254, holds  \"It is very evident from a reading of it [§ 2] that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic.\"</p>\n<p><i>United States</i> v. <i>Behrman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99951\"><a href=\"/opinion/99951/united-states-v-behrman/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 287, came up under the Criminal Appeals Act. The indictment charged that Behrman, a registered physician, did unlawfully sell, barter and give to one King, an \"addict,\" one hundred and fifty grains of heroin, three hundred and sixty grains of morphine and two hundred and ten grains of cocaine, by issuing three prescriptions. Further, that the drugs were not intended or required for treatment of any disease or condition other than such addiction, but for self-administration over a period of several days. The question was, \"Do the acts charged in this indictment constitute an offense within the meaning of the statute?\" And replying, this court said </p>\n<p>\"The District Judge who heard this case was of the opinion that prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such quantity to addicts as charged in the indictment. . . . In our opinion the District Judge who heard the case was right in his conclusion and should have overruled the demurrer. Former decisions of this court have held that the purpose of the exception is to confine the distribution of these drugs to the regular and lawful course of professional practice, and that not everything called a prescription is necessarily such. [<i>Webb</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> <i>United States</i> and <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i> v. <i>United States, supra</i><i>,</i> are cited.] . . . It may be admitted that to prescribe a single dose, or even a number of doses, may not bring a physician within the penalties of the Act; but what is here charged is that the defendant physician by means of prescriptions has enabled one, known by him to be an addict, to obtain from a pharmacist the enormous number of doses contained in 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine\"  three thousand ordinary doses!</p>\n<p>This opinion related to definitely alleged facts and must be so understood. The enormous quantity of drugs ordered, considered in connection with the recipient's character, without explanation, seemed enough to show prohibited sales and to exclude the idea of <i>bona fide</i> professional action in the ordinary course. The opinion cannot be accepted as authority for holding that a physician, who, acts <i>bona fide</i> and according to fair medical standards, may never give an addict moderate amounts of drugs for self-administration in order to relieve conditions incident to addiction. Enforcement of the tax demands no such drastic rule, and if the Act had such scope it would certainly encounter grave constitutional difficulties.</p>\n<p>The Narcotic Law is essentially a revenue measure and its provisions must be reasonably applied with the primary view of enforcing the special tax. We find no facts alleged in the indictment sufficient to show that petitioner had done anything falling within definite inhibitions or sufficient materially to imperil orderly collection of revenue from sales. Federal power is delegated, and its prescribed limits must not be transcended even though the end seem desirable. The unfortunate condition of the recipient certainly created no reasonable probability that she would sell or otherwise dispose of the few tablets entrusted to her; and we cannot say that by so dispensing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> them the doctor necessarily transcended the limits of that professional conduct with which Congress never intended to interfere.</p>\n<p>The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 100630, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/100630/", "sha1": "0e6303474b421b1a9e40b72fa0d463bc496f01e6", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:48:31"}
