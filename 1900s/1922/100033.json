And the court further certified that the second count of the indictment was based upon the amended Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, contained in \u00a7 1006 of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1130, and that the count was predicated upon the following provisions: \"It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute any of the aforesaid drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package . . . \"; and that he construed \"the word `person' in the foregoing language to mean the persons enumerated in the first paragraph of section 1006, namely, `every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses, or gives away opium or coca leaves, or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation thereof, shall register with the collector of internal revenue of the district his name or style, place of business and place or places where such business is to be carried on, and pay the special taxes hereinafter provided.'\"</p>\n<p>The demurrer was sustained, it was further certified, because the second count contained no appropriate allegation giving effect to the word \"person\" and hence fell within the ruling in the <i>Jin Fuey Moy Case;</i> otherwise, it was said, the amendment would be unconstitutional.

The principle of the decision applies to the Act of 1919, upon which count two is based.
