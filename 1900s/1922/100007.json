JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed a judgment against petitioner Packing Company rendered by the trial court upon a verdict for damages on account of injuries which respondent suffered while employed upon petitioner's motor boat afloat in navigable Alaskan waters.</p>\n<p>Respondent claimed that, prior to the departure of the boat upon a trip intended to occupy perhaps six or eight hours, petitioner or its agents negligently filled with gasoline and placed thereon a can which ordinarily contained coal oil (and was so labelled) for use according to the prevailing custom in those waters to start fires in the small stove where meals were cooked and water heated. Without knowledge of the substitution, respondent poured the gasoline upon the fire wood, applied a match, an explosion resulted and he was badly burned. He further <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> claimed that no life preservers had been placed on board and that his injuries were aggravated by delay attending search for one before he jumped into the water to extinguish his flaming clothes.</p>\n<p>The trial court held \"the basis of the action is negligence,\" and instructed the jury according to the common-law rules in respect thereto. It said that if petitioner or its authorized agents negligently filled the can with gasoline and placed it upon the boat, and if by reason of such negligence respondent suffered injury, he was entitled to recover compensatory damages therefor, provided he himself had not been guilty of contributory negligence. Further, that if the injuries resulting directly from the explosion were aggravated because no life preservers had been placed on board, then additional compensation could be awarded for such aggravation. Also that if the explosion occurred without petitioner's negligence but the absence of life preservers caused aggravation of respondent's injuries, he would be entitled to recover for such injuries as resulted directly from the negligence in respect of the life preservers but not for those caused solely by the explosion.</p>\n<p>We have heretofore announced the general doctrine concerning rights and liabilities of the parties when one of a crew sustains injuries while on a vessel in navigable waters.</p>\n<p>\"The vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued.</p>\n<p>\"The vessel and her owner are, both by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries received by seamen in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.</p>\n<p>\"All the members of the crew, except perhaps the master, are, as between themselves, fellow servants, and hence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> seamen cannot recover for injuries sustained through the negligence of another member of the crew beyond the expense of their maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p>\"The seaman is not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member of the crew, but is entitled to maintenance and cure, whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident.\" <i>The Osceola,</i> 189 U.S. 158, 175; <i>Chelentis</i> v. <i>Luckenbach S.S.
