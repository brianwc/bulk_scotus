The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the property was not taxable because the lessee was a federal instrumentality and Congress had not consented to its taxation. 177 Okl. 67, 57 P.(2d) 1167.

The tax is an ad valorem tax for the year 1933&#8212;34.

In the former case where there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of governmental functions, we have held that a nondis criminatory ad valorem tax is valid, although the property is used in the operations of the governmental agency. This distinction, recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, 4 L.Ed. 579, was stated and applied after full consideration in Thomson v.
