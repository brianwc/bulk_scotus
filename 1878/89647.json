The warehouses provided were for two purposes,&#8212;one for the custody of tobacco designed for export, and the other for custody of tobacco designed either for export or for domestic consumption or sale. Whenever the tobacco was removed for the latter uses, and when, consequently, the tax was paid to the collector of the district in which the warehouse was situated, the proviso inserted by the act of 1866 divided the commissions on the tax between the collector of that district and the collector of the district from which the tobacco had been removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such was the law when the act of 1868 was enacted.
