Gannett, Esq., is hereby appointed Special Commissioner to locate and mark upon the ground the boundary line, at the points specified herein, and to make record of the point [s] so marked with all convenient speed. The reasonable compensation and expenses of the Commissioner, as allowed by this Court, and all other costs incident to the location and marking of such boundary line and making record thereof as provided herein shall be paid by the two States, in equal shares.</p>\n<p><i>Fourth.</i> Before entering upon the discharge of his duties, the Commissioner shall be duly sworn to perform fairly, impartially, and without prejudice or bias the duties imposed upon him, said oath to be taken before the Clerk of this Court, or before the Clerk of the District Court of the United States for the District of the said Commissioner's residence, or for the District of New Hampshire, or for the District of Vermont, and returned with his report. The Commissioner is authorized to adopt all usual and reasonable methods to ascertain the true location of the said boundary line, including reference to the record, transcript and evidence in this cause, and the taking of new evidence, oral or documentary, under oath; but in the event new evidence is taken the parties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> shall be notified and permitted to be present and cross-examine the witnesses; and all evidence taken by the Commissioner, and all exceptions thereto, and action thereon, shall be preserved and certified and returned with his report. The Commissioner shall mark the points upon the boundary line as designated herein with permanent monuments, erected by him or under his direction, and wherever he shall deem it necessary or desirable to do so such monuments may be established upon the fast upland and shall be suitably inscribed to indicate by distances and courses therefrom the point on the boundary line as it is fixed at the time of the erection of such monument. He shall, upon completion of the location and marking of such points on the boundary line, report to this Court, describing the several monuments established, and their location and their distances and courses to the boundary, and his determinations shall be subject in all respects to the approval of this Court. A copy of his report shall be promptly delivered to the Clerk of this Court and to the Attorneys General of the two States, and exceptions or objections, if any, to such report shall be presented to this Court, or, if it is not in session, filed with the Clerk within forty (40) days after the delivery of such report. On approval by this Court of such report, the Commissioner shall be discharged.</p>\n<p><i>Fifth.</i> In the event that either State shall hereafter desire additional points on the boundary line to be located and marked, or any points to be relocated and remarked where the boundary has been affected by erosion or accretion, this Court will, upon application, appoint a Commissioner for the purpose.</p>\n<p><i>Sixth.</i> The State of Vermont, its officers, agents and representatives, its citizens, and all other persons, are perpetually enjoined from disputing the sovereignty, jurisdiction and dominion of New Hampshire over the territory adjudged to her by this decree; and the State of New <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> Hampshire, its officers, agents and representatives, its citizens, and all other persons, are perpetually enjoined from disputing the sovereignty, jurisdiction and dominion of Vermont over the territory adjudged to her by this decree.</p>\n<p><i>Seventh.</i> The costs of this suit will be equally divided between the States, and this case is retained on the docket for further orders, in fulfillment of the provisions of this decree.</p>\n</div>", "id": 102177, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/102177/", "sha1": "03381a13cf441043627b02166c3a1fc949d8af60", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:52:25"}
