Defendant answered, raising issues of fact. The Court appointed Edward K. Campbell special master, 280 U.S. 514, 50 S.Ct. 15, 74 L.Ed. 585, who took the evidence and reported the same, together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for a decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He found that defendant had created, and was continuing to create, a public nuisance upon beaches and other property of plaintiff, concluded plaintiff was entitled to relief, and recommended that injunction be granted as prayed, but that defendant should be allowed a reasonable time within which to provide incinerators for the disposal of its garbage and rubbish. After hearing upon exceptions filed by defendant, the Court approved the master's report. As no evidence had been taken to show what time would be required, the master was directed to take evidence upon that subject and report his findings and a form of decree. 283 U.S. 473, 51 S.Ct. 519, 75 L.Ed. 1176.

It represented that, because of lack of financial means, the construction of the plants had been unavoidably delayed, and that it was unable, within the time allowed, to complete the plants and to cease dumping.
