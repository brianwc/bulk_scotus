Thereafter the income was to be paid to her husband for his life, and upon his death the trustee was directed to pay and transfer the principal of the trust absolutely to their daughter if she survived, but, if not, then to the issue of the daughter, with a gift over in default of such issue.

We are not at liberty to disregard the explicit holding of the state court as to the basis of its decision, except for convincing reasons, which here we are unable to find.

The entire effort of the court upon this point plainly was directed towards sustaining the view that the event sought to be taxed fell within the provisions of the act of 1923. There is a reference to the act of 1929, but the decision is definitely put upon the act of 1923, and is supported by considerations of such weight as to leave no occasion for dependence upon the later act; and the supposition that in fact effect was given to it is without warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the court below construed the act of 1923, without regard to the act of 1929, as embracing the event sought to be taxed, and since in that view the question of contract impairment does not arise, we are bound by the decision of that court as though the meaning as fixed by the court had been expressed in the statute itself in specific words.

There a similar tax was held bad because the state statute imposing it was passed after the creation of the trusts; but the court said: 'Undoubtedly the state has power to lay such an excise upon property so passing after the taking effect of the taxing act.' While, strictly, that statement was not necessary to the decision, we follow it as expressing the settled conviction of this court, and, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, sustain the validity of the act of 1923 as construed by the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>287 U.S. 509 (1933)</b></center>\n<center><h1>GUARANTY TRUST CO., EXECUTOR,<br>\nv.<br>\nBLODGETT, TAX COMMISSIONER.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 217.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued December 15, 1932.</center>\n<center>Decided January 9, 1933.</center>\nAPPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT OF FAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*510</span> <i>Mr. Gregory Hankin</i> for appellant.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Farwell Knapp,</i> Assistant Tax Commissioner, with whom <i>Mr. Ernest L.
