The question turns of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act of February 24, 1919), c. 18, &#167; 234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1057, 1078, allowing as deductions, inter alia, 'A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' The good will was that of a brewery and is found to have been destroyed by prohibition legislation. The deduction claimed is for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1919, it having been apparent early in 1918 that prohibition was imminent, and the officers having taken steps to prepare for the total or partial liquidation of the Company.

It seems to us plain without help from Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 8 S. Ct. 273, 31 L.

It seems to us no less plain that Congress cannot be taken to have intended such a partial compensation to be provided for by the words 'exhaustion' or 'obsolescence.' Neither word is apt to describe termination by law as an evil of a business otherwise flourishing, and neither becomes more applicable because the death is lingering rather than instantaneous. It is incredible that Congress by an Act approved on February 24, 1919, should have meant to enable parties to cut down their taxes on such grounds because of an amendment to the Constitution that it had submitted to the legislatures of the States in 1917 and that had been ratified by the legislatures of a sufficient number of States the month before the present Act was passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>280 U.S. 384 (1930)</b></center>\n<center><h1>CLARKE, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE,<br>\nv.<br>\nHABERLE CRYSTAL SPRINGS BREWING COMPANY.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 68.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued January 9, 1930.</center>\n<center>Decided January 27, 1930.</center>\nCERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> <i>Assistant Attorney General Youngquist,</i> with whom <i>Solicitor General Hughes, Messrs.
