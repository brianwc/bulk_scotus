In the message as transmitted the word 'fifteen' was substituted for the word 'fifty.' Respondent, who in consequence of the error suffered damage in the sum of $352.10, brought suit in the circuit court of Butler county, Alabama, to recover for petitioner's negligence in failing to transmit the message as given. The company pleaded that (a) as the message was not a repeated message its liability was limited to the amount received for sending it, by the terms of the tariffs and classifications filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission under Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, &#167; 7, amending Interstate Commerce Act, &#167; 1 (49 USCA &#167; 1; Comp.

Although it is suggested in the opinion (pages 17-19 (14 S.

Interstate Commerce Act, &#167; 1, as amended by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, &#167; 7, 36 Stat. 539 (49 USCA &#167; 1; Comp. St. &#167; 8563). By section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act it is provided that subject to the approval of the Commission messages received by telegraph companies for transmission may be classified into 'repeated, unrepeated * * * and such other classes as are just and reasonable, and different rates may be charged for the different classes of messages.' The established rates for unrepeated messages thus became the lawful rates and the attendant limitation of liability became the lawful condition upon which messages might be sent. Unrepeated Message Case, 44 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 670; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. &amp; Co., supra, 571 (41 S. Ct. 584); Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Warren-Godwin Co., 251 U.

Ed. 682. What had previously been a matter of common-law liability, with such contractual restrictions as the states might permit, then became the subject of federal legislation to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any. Since that end is attainable only by adherence to the approved rate, based upon an authorized classification, that rate 'represents the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.' Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. &amp; Co., supra. Such being the basis of liability, we do not perceive any adequate ground upon which it may be enlarged merely by the application of a 'vituperative epithet' to the admitted fault of the petitioner. Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Ry. v. Arms, supra, 494. For if it be assumed that we can weigh and measure degrees of negligence and that a public service company may not by contract alone limit its liability for gross negligence, so called, nevertheless we may not disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which has made no distinction between degrees of negligence, nor may we, upon any theory of public policy, annex to the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and equality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The message here was unrepeated and the loss resulted from a mistake in transmission.

Interstate Commerce Act § 1, as amended by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 7, 36 Stat. 539. By § 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act it is provided that subject to the approval of the Commission messages received by telegraph companies for transmission may be classified into \"repeated, unrepeated . . . and such other classes as are just and reasonable, and different rates may be charged for the different classes of messages.\" The established rates for unrepeated messages thus became the lawful rates and the attendant limitation of liability became the lawful condition upon which messages might be sent. <i>Unrepeated Message Case,</i> 44 I.C.C. 670; <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Esteve Bros. &amp; Co., supra,</i> 571; <i>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co.</i> v. <i>Warren-Godwin Co.,</i> 251 U.S. 27; <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Boegli,</i> 251 U.S. 315; <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Czizek,</i> 264 U.S. 281. What had previously been a matter of common law liability, with such contractual restrictions as the states might permit, then became the subject of federal legislation to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any. Since that end is attainable only by adherence to the approved rate, based upon an authorized classification, that rate \"represents the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.\" <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Esteve Bros. &amp; Co., supra</i><i>.</i> Such being the basis of liability, we do not perceive any adequate ground upon which it may be enlarged merely by the application of a \"vituperative epithet\" to the admitted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> fault of the petitioner. <i>Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Ry.</i> v. <i>Arms, supra,</i> 494. For if it be assumed that we can weigh and measure degrees of negligence and that a public service company may not by contract alone limit its liability for gross negligence, so-called, nevertheless we may not disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which has made no distinction between degrees of negligence, nor may we, upon any theory of public policy, annex to the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and equality.</p>\n<p>The message here was unrepeated and the loss resulted from a mistake in transmission. The case thus comes within the express provision of clause 1 of the tariff, limiting the liability to the amount received for the service.</p>\n<p>The cause will be reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   \"ALL MESSAGES TAKEN BY THIS COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS.\n</p>\n<p>\"To guard against mistakes or delays, the sender of a message should order it repeated, that is telegraphed back to the originating office for comparison. For this one-half the unrepeated message rate is charged in addition. Unless otherwise indicated on its face, THIS IS AN UNREPEATED MESSAGE AND PAID FOR AS SUCH, in consideration whereof it is agreed between the sender of the message and the Company as follows:</p>\n<p>\"1. The Company shall not be liable for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for non-delivery, of an unrepeated message, beyond the amount received for sending the same; nor for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for non-delivery, of any repeated message beyond fifty times the sum received for sending the same, unless specially valued; nor in any case for delays arising from unavoidable interruption in the working of its lines; nor for errors in cipher or obscure messages.</p>\n<p>\"2. In any event the Company shall not be liable for damages for any mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for non-delivery of this message, whether caused by the negligence of its servants or otherwise, beyond the sum of Fifty Dollars, at which amount this message is hereby valued, unless a greater value is stated in writing hereon at the time the message is offered to the Company for transmission, and an additional sum paid or agreed to be paid based on such value equal to one-tenth of one per cent, thereof.\"</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 101236, "judges": "Stone", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/101236/", "sha1": "40fdf699d49391f170faf485fdfdaefb91282971", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:48:44"}
