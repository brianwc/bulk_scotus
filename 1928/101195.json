This section, in so far as here material, provided that actions at law based on causes of action arising out of the operation by the President of the railroad of any carrier, might, after the termination of Federal control, be brought against 'an agent designated by the President for such purpose * * * within the periods of limitation now prescribed by State of Federal statutes,' and that a judgment 'rendered against the agent designated by the President' should be paid out of a revolving fund created by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1918, a cause of action accrued in favor of the Arkansas Land &amp; Lumber Company on account of the misdelivery of a carload of lumber shipped by it over the railroads of two carriers then being operated under Federal control.

Davis, thereafter appearing, pleaded that under section 206 of the Transportation Act the suit could not be prosecuted against him as he had not been made a party within the period of limitation prescribed by the Arkansas statute. The circuit court sustained this plea and dismissed the suit. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment on the ground that the substitution of Davis was not the institution of a new action against him, but merely an amendment correcting the name of the defendant in furtherance f justice; and remanded the cause to the circuit court. Arkansas Land &amp; Lumber Co. v. Davis, 155 Ark. 541, 244 S. W. 730. Davis there renewed his plea under the Transportation Act. This was overruled, and judgment was rendered against him. The Supreme Court-in which the petitioner, who meanwhile had succeeded Davis as the designated agent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> was substituted as the appellant-adhered to its former ruling and affirmed the judgment.

The United States had not consented to being sued after the termination of Federal control except as provided by section 206 of the Transportation Act, that is, by a suit brought against the Agent designated by the President for such purpose, within the period of limitation prescribed by the State statute. This plainly meant that the suit must be brought within the period of limitation against the person who was the designated Agent and alone had authority to represent the Government. The bringing of the suit against Payne, who was not the designated Agent, was not a compliance with this requirement and brought no representative of the Government before the court. Davidson v. Payne (C. C. A.) 289 F. 69. The substitution of Davis, the designated Agent, was not the correction of an error in the name of the defendant, but the bringing in of a different defendant, and was in effect the commencement of a new and independent proceeding against him to enforce the liability of the Government.
