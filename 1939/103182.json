From that situation the pension money of plaintiff in error had departed.\"</p>\n<p>Section 22 World War Veterans' Act, 1924, c. 320, 43 Stat. 607, 613 (38 U.S.C., § 454), repealed by Act August 4, 1935, provided </p>\n<p>\"That the compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable under Titles II, III, and IV, respectively, shall not be assignable; shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made under Titles II, III, or IV; and shall be exempt from all taxation: <i>Provided,</i> That such compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance shall be subject to any claims which the United States may have, under Titles II, III, IV, and V, against the person on whose account the compensation, insurance, or maintenance and support allowance is payable. . . .\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*549</span> <i>Trotter</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> (1933) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102161\"><a href=\"/opinion/102161/trotter-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 356-357, construed this section. A veteran had purchased land in Tennessee with money received as compensation, and claimed exemption from taxation. We said </p>\n<p>\"The moneys payable to this soldier were unquestionably exempt till they came into his hands or the hands of his guardian. <i>McIntosh</i> v. <i>Aubrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95638\"><a href=\"/opinion/95638/mcintosh-v-aubrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>. We leave the question open whether the exemption remained in force while they continued in those hands or on deposit in a bank. . . . Be that as it may, we think it very clear that there was an end to the exemption when they lost the quality of moneys and were converted into land and buildings. The statute speaks of `compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable' to the veteran, and declares that these shall be exempt. We see no token of a purpose to extend a like immunity to permanent investments or the fruits of business enterprises.\"</p>\n<p>In 1935 Congress gave much consideration to the exemption which should be accorded to veterans. The outcome is shown by §§ 3 and 5, Act August 12, 1935, <i>ante,</i> p. 546.</p>\n<p>Section 3 of that Act came under review in <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Shaw,</i> (1937) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102771\"><a href=\"/opinion/102771/lawrence-v-shaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 249-250. Exemption was successfully claimed for bank deposits standing in the name of a veteran's guardian upon the view that such deposits, made in the ordinary course and subject to demand for the veteran's use, should be treated as if money in his hands.</p>\n<p>\"The World War Veterans' Act, 1924, provided that the compensation and insurance allowances should be `exempt from all taxation.' The Act of 1935 is more specific, providing that the payments shall be exempt from taxation and shall not be liable to process `either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.' There was added the qualification that the exemption should not extend `to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.' This more detailed provision was substituted for that of the earlier Act and was expressly made applicable to payments theretofore made. We think it clear that the provision of the later Act was intended to clarify the former rather than to change its import and it was with that purpose that it was made retroactive. . . . The provision of the Act of 1935 that the exemption should not apply to property purchased out of the moneys received from the Government shows the intent to deny exemption to investments, as was ruled in the <i>Trotter</i> case.\"</p>\n<p>The questioned judgment must be</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 103182, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/103182/", "sha1": "3a28e0601fc48d5adb12e0a25d47d8ad4535976b", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:54:19"}
