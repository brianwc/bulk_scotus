Section 266 of the Judicial Code provides for a court of three judges where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement 'of any statute of a State' or 'of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such State', upon the ground of unconstitutionality. The provision in relation to administrative orders was added by an amendment to the original section. Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1013.

Russell, 261 U.S. 290, 292, 43 S.Ct. 353, 67 L.Ed. 659, Congress adopted the amendment out of abundant caution. But with these provisions of Section 266 before it, Congress in enacting Section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, did not refer to 'any statute' or to administrative orders, but confined its requirement to cases of attack upon an 'Act of Congress' upon the ground that 'such Act or any part thereof is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States'. This is not an apt description of administrative regulations or orders. We must regard the choice of language as deliberate and as indicating a limitation deemed to be advisable.
