Directly after its organization, and on July 1, 1918, it acquired the entire express business and all property connected therewith of the Adams Company and issued therefor several million dollars of its capital stock. (Like transfers were made by the other express companies.) The seller immediately ceased to operate in Kentucky and the purchaser continued the business.

It went no further. No earlier opinion was overruled or qualified, and no rule was given any retroactive effect. Save in exceptional circumstances, not now present, we must accept as controlling the decision of the state courts upon questions of local law, both statutory and common. 'The due process clause does not take up the laws of the several states, and make all questions pertaining to them constitutional questions, nor does it enable this court to revise the decisions of the state courts upon questions of state law.'

We cannot interfere, unless the judgment amounts to mere arbitrary or capricious exercise of power, or is in clear conflict with those fundamental 'principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights.' Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 733 (24 L. Ed. 565); Booth v. Illinois, 184 U. S. 425, 429, 22 S. Ct. 425, 46 L. Ed. 623; Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U. S. 312, 329, 42 S. Ct. 124, 66 L. Ed. 254, 27 A. L.

The transfer of all the latter's property located in the state materially interfered with the ability of Kentucky creditors to enforce their claims, and, as to them, might have been declared fraudulent. It seems clear that the state, without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, might have enacted through its legislative department a statute of precisely the same effect as the rule of law and public policy declared by the Court of Appeals, and its decision is just as valid as such a statute would have been.

The action of the court followed a fair hearing, and there is no pretense that the challenged views were adopted in order to evade a constitutional issue. We cannot interfere unless the judgment amounts to mere arbitrary or capricious exercise of power or is in clear conflict with those fundamental \"principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights.\" <i>Pennoyer</i> v. <i>Neff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89656\"><a href=\"/opinion/89656/pennoyer-v-neff/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 733; <i>Booth</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95605\"><a href=\"/opinion/95605/booth-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 429; <i>Truax</i> v. <i>Corrigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99887\"><a href=\"/opinion/99887/truax-v-corrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 329.</p>\n<p>It is firmly established that a merely erroneous decision given by a state court in the regular course of judicial proceedings does not deprive the unsuccessful party of property without due process of law. <i>Arrowsmith</i> v. <i>Harmoning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91684\"><a href=\"/opinion/91684/arrowsmith-v-harmoning/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 195; <i>Iowa Central Ry.

The transfer of all the latter's property located in the State materially interfered with the ability of Kentucky creditors to enforce their claims, and, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> as to them, might have been declared fraudulent. It seems clear that the State, without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, might have enacted through its legislative department a statute of precisely the same effect as the rule of law and public policy declared by the Court of Appeals, and its decision is just as valid as such a statute would have been. <i>Prudential Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Cheek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100023\"><a href=\"/opinion/100023/prudential-ins-co-of-america-v-cheek/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 548.</p>\n<p>The above-expressed view is sufficiently confirmed by what this Court said in <i>Mutual Reserve Association</i> v. <i>Phelps,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95889\"><a href=\"/opinion/95889/mutual-reserve-fund-life-assn-v-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 158, 159, which upheld the validity of a statute providing for service of process after a corporation had ceased to do business within and had withdrawn all agents from the State; and <i>Lemieux</i> v. <i>Young, Trustee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96918\"><a href=\"/opinion/96918/lemieux-v-young-trustee/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 492, 495, and <i>Kidd, Dater Co.</i> v. <i>Musselman Grocer Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97249\"><a href=\"/opinion/97249/kidd-dater-price-co-v-musselman-grocer-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 472, <i>et seq.,</i> which sustained the power of a State to impossibility for the seller's debts upon a purchaser of merchandise in bulk.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below must be</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Mr. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND and MR.
