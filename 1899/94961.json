For the support of which many cases were cited, and further: 'If the judgment is not one which disposes of the whole case on its merits, it is not final.

The specific contention is that the Kansas statute violates that portion of the Fourteenth Amendment which provides: \"Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p>The defendants in error, however, object to the jurisdiction of this court, and urge that the judgment appealed from is not a final one, and is not therefore reviewable in this court.</p>\n<p>It is further urged that the record does not show that anything was done in the lower court after decision in the Supreme Court, but that error is prosecuted directly to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and that that determined only a question of pleading, and that its direction has not yet been acted on, and that no judgment of any kind has been entered against Wyandotte township or school district No. 9.</p>\n<p>The law of Kansas prescribing action on demurrer is as follows: \"If the demurrer be sustained, the adverse party may amend, if the defect can be remedied by way of amendment, with or without costs, as the court, in its discretion, shall direct.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Bostwick</i> v. <i>Brinkerhoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90641\"><a href=\"/opinion/90641/bostwick-v-brinkerhoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, it was decided that \"the rule is well settled and of long standing that a judgment or decree to be final, within the meaning of that term, as used in the acts of Congress giving this court jurisdiction on appeals and writs of error, must terminate the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, so that if there should be an affirmance here, the court below would have nothing to do but to execute the judgment or decree it had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*337</span> already rendered.\" For the support of which many cases were cited, and further: \"If the judgment is not one which disposes of the whole case on its merits, it is not final. Consequently, it has been uniformly held that a judgment of reversal, with leave for further proceedings in the court below, cannot be brought here on writ of error.\" Also citing cases.</p>\n<p>This case and those it cites have been applied many times, but we will confine our notice to instances of demurrer. <i>De Armas</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span>, was of this kind, but the grounds of demurrer urged there made the rule when applied to them not very disputable, and the case is not of much aid.</p>\n<p>In <i>Meagher</i> v. <i>Minnesota Thresher Mfg.

Upon appeal to the Supreme Court the order overruling the demurrer was affirmed with costs. The rule of the Supreme Court provided that \"upon the reversal, affirmance or modification of any order or judgment of the District Court by this court, there will be a <i>remittitur</i> to the District Court, unless otherwise ordered.\" Held, that the plaintiffs in error upon the return of the case to the court could plead over, and hence judgment was not final.</p>\n<p>In <i>Werner</i> v. <i>Charleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93776\"><a href=\"/opinion/93776/werner-v-charleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, the announcement by the Chief Justice was: \"The writ of error is dismissed. <i>Meagher</i> v. <i>Minnesota Thresher Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93411\"><a href=\"/opinion/93411/meagher-v-minnesota-thresher-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>; <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Sanger,</i> 144 U.S. 197; <i>Hume</i> v. <i>Bowie,</i> 148 U.S. 245.\"</p>\n<p>The statement of the case shows that it was analogous to the case at bar. The motion to dismiss stated that </p>\n<p>\"The judgment brought here by writ of error for review is a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina, which simply affirmed a decision of the lower court overruling a demurrer, and thereby remanded the case to the court below for a hearing on the merits. It is, therefore, an interlocutory judgment, and is in no sense a final decree.</p>\n<p>\"To this the plaintiff in error replied: `The judgment brought here by writ of error for review is the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina, holding that a certain act of the general assembly of the State of South Carolina, entitled, \"An act to authorize the city council <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> of Charleston to fill up low lots and grounds in the city of Charleston in certain cases and for other purposes,\" approved on the 18th of December, 1830, is not in violation of the Constitution of the United States, thereby affirming the judgment of the trial court and so ending the constitutional defence interposed by the plaintiff in error.'</p>\n<p>\"An examination of the record will show that the main ground of the demurrer, interposed in the court below by the plaintiff in error, was the unconstitutionality of the act of 1830. It was claimed both there and in the court above, as well as in this court, to be in violation of due process of law.\" <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Sanger</i> and <i>Hume</i> v. <i>Bowie</i><i>,</i> cited by the Chief Justice, were not rulings on demurrer, and we have confined our notice to cases of that kind, not because they are separable in principle from the other cases decided, but to observe and explain the rule in its special application. That rule is in its utmost generality that no judgment is final which does not terminate the litigation between the parties to the suit. If anything substantial remain to be done to this end, the judgment is not final. The law of the case upon the pleadings, and hence as presented by the demurrer, may be settled, but if power remain to make a new case, either by the direction of the Supreme Court or in the absence of such direction by the statutes of the State, the judgment is not final.</p>\n<p>The statute of Kansas permitted such amendment, and the order of the Supreme Court did not take it away. Its order proceeds no further than a direction to sustain the demurrer to the petition. That done, the lower court had and has all of its power under the statute, and may exercise it at the invocation of plaintiffs in error. What they may be advised to do we cannot know. We can only consider their right and the power of the court. These existing, if we should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court, that court, and may be this court, may be called upon to determine other issues between the parties.</p>\n<p><i>It follows from these views that the judgment of the Supreme Court is not final, and the writ of error must be dismissed; and it is so ordered.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 94961, "judges": "McKenna", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/94961/", "sha1": "3b089fcff17cc5d102125eadde0f74f57d8400ab", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:38:01"}
