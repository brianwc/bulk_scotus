The writ of error was filed in the clerk's office of the court below on the same 23d of December. The judgment below was not signed until the 4th day of January, 1806. The writ of error was not returned and filed in the clerk's office of the supreme court until the 18th of March, 1806, after the court had closed its session.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P. B.

After the expiration of the term it was void. The execution of a writ of error is the sending up the record according to its command, and to send the record up at another term is no execution of the writ.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He relied upon the case of <i>Blair</i> v. <i>Miller, in this court</i>, 4 <i>Dall.</i> 21. as being decisive.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\"><i>February</i> 28.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Chief Justice</i> stated that there had been some difference of opinion among the judges, which arose from their not understanding perfectly the facts of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the writ of error had been served when it was not in force, (that is, after its return day,) such service would have been void.
