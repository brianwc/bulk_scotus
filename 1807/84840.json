That the defendants offered as a witness one Peleg Remington, who had become jointly and severally bound with the defendant, Carrington, in a bottomry or respondentia bond to the plaintiffs, in the sum of 31,950 dollars, conditioned to pay to the plaintiffs that sum, on the return of the ship to Hamburgh, the same being the amount advanced by the plaintiffs to the defendants in Hamburgh; and that the ship should so return; for which advance, with other demands, this action was brought. To the admission of which witness the plaintiffs objected; contending that he was interested to diminish the balance due from the defendants to the plaintiffs. But the defendants insisted he was a competent witness as to all the items of the account, except the advances for which he was bound, particularly with respect to a charge of 13,718 dollars and 56 cents, for premium of insurance on the intended return voyage from the Havanna to Hamburgh, and which voyage the defendants contended was never begun, and therefore they ought not to be charged with that premium; and especially as the defendants had expressly waived all objections to every other part of the plaintiffs' account. Whereupon the said witness was suffered by the court to testify as to the charge of that premium only. The bill of exceptions states it as admitted, that by the law of Hamburgh, the underwriters are not bound to return the premium upon a change of the voyage, unless that change be notified before the vessel sails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That the defendants offered in evidence a paper, purporting to be a copy of a letter from the defendant, Carrington, to <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> of Philadelphia, the <i>correspondents</i> of the plaintiffs; and <i>a letter</i> from <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> to <i>Carrington</i>, purporting to be an answer thereunto; but gave no proof that the said copy of Carrington's letter was a true copy of the original, but it was not denied to be in his hand-writing, and it was proved that he was in Canton, and not in the United States at the time of trial, and had been in Canton for two years before, but had been corresponded with on the subject of this action since its commencement. Whereupon the court permitted the copy and the letter to go in evidence to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. The plaintiffs, after stating in the bill of exceptions, and referring to all the <i>testimony</i> and other evidence in the case, but not stating distinctly the <i>material facts</i> which they supposed to be the result of that testimony and evidence, and on which their prayer was founded, prayed the court to declare their opinion to the jury <i>whether</i>, if the plaintiffs had actually paid the premium to the underwriters, before notice of the change of the destination of the ship, they had a right, '<i>under the circumstances of the case</i>,' to recover the same of the defendants. But the court refused to deliver an opinion particularly thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. The bill of exceptions further stated, that the court, prior to the request last mentioned, declared to the jury that 'the case wholly turned upon the point whether or not the defendants had given due and seasonable notice of the change of the destination of said ship. That it was a question proper for the jury to decide, whether such due and seasonable notice had been given, and that if they were of opinion that it had been so given, on considering the whole of the evidence, they ought not to allow the plaintiff's said charge for the said <i>premium;</i> and with that direction left the same to the jury; and the jury aforesaid then and there gave their verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of 13,677 dollars and eight cents only, and disallowed the said charge and demand of the plaintiffs for the said permium of insurance, except one half per cent which the jury allowed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The errors assigned by the plaintiffs in error were,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

That the court admitted the writing purporting to be a copy of a letter from the defendant, <i>Carrington</i>, to <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i>, and a writing purporting to be a letter from <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> to the said <i>Carrington</i>, to be read in evidence, as stated in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. That the court directed the jury that the case turned wholly upon the point whether due and seasonable notice had been given by the defendants of the change of the voyage, as stated in the bill of exceptions; and that this was wholly a question of fact, which it was their exclusive province to determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. That the court refused to direct the jury, in case it was fully proved to their satisfaction, that the plaintiffs had paid the premium in question previous to any notice or information whatever of the change of the voyage, as stated in the bill of exceptions, that they were entitled to recover of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Robbins</i>, for the plaintiffs in error, contended,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the underwriters, under the law of Hamburgh, had a right to retain the premium, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That whether they had or not, the plaintiffs having received the defendants' orders to insure, and having actually done it, and paid the premium before those orders were countermanded, had a right to recover it back from the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the underwriters had a right to retain the premium even under the English law, because the risk had commenced. It was to begin from the shore. But the Hamburgh law being admitted, and no evidence being given that the change of voyage was notified to the underwriters before the ship sailed, the question is too plain to require argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. But whether the underwriters were liable to refund or not, the plaintiffs have a right to recover from the defendants, what they paid for premium under the existing orders of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the underwriters are liable to refund, the plaintiffs are not bound to resort to them. That is the duty of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money being paid by the plaintiffs before the orders for insurance were countermanded, there can be no pretence that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Remington was not a competent witness, because in a suit against him upon the bond, he might show that the whole amount for which he was liable had been paid; which he could not do if the plaintiffs had a right to apply the credit side of the account to discharge the money by them advanced for the premium. He was, therefore, directly interested in the event of the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. There was no proof that the paper offered as a copy of the defendant <i>Carrington's</i> letter to <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> was a copy of the original, and therefore it ought not to have been received, nor was there any evidence offered of the hand-writing of <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> to the paper purporting to be a letter from them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The opinion of the court that reasonable notice was wholly a question of <i>fact</i>, was erroneous. We contend, that in all mercantile cases, reasonable notice is a question of law. 1 <i>T.

As to the competency of <i>Remington</i>. A witness cannot be excluded if he is competent to answer any question. 3 <i>T. R.</i> 27. <i>Bent</i> v. <i>Baker</i>. If the suit had been brought only for the premium of insurance, his competency would have been unquestionable. Shall it be in the power of the plaintiffs to deprive the defendants of their witness, by blending other matters of account in their action? Surely not. But here all the other items of the plaintiffs' account were expressly admitted by the defendants before they offered Remington as a witness; and he was offered as a witness to that one item only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. As to the copy of <i>Carrington's</i> letter, it is connected with that from <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i>, which the bill of exceptions states to be <i>a letter from them to Carrington</i>, purporting to be in answer to Carrington's letter to them. There was evidence that it was in his hand-writing, and that he had been absent in China for two years, so that he could not have fabricated it for the occasion. Where there is a connected correspondence, the whole ought to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mercantile cases, the rules of evidence are not so strict as in other cases. 1 <i>Dall.</i> 16, 17. <i>Riche</i> v. <i>Broadfield.

Com.</i> 372.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch. J. Is not the reason why the English books do not show such a case, because, upon a doubt as to the correctness of the opinion of the judge in his charge to the jury, a case is always made, and a new trial moved for, on the ground of misdirection?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ingersoll</i>. If the court had given an opinion upon the reasonableness of the notice, it would have been error, because it is a matter of fact. But here the prayer was that the court should given an opinion as to the <i>fact</i> of notice, as well as to the reasonableness of notice. The expression '<i>under the circumstances of the case</i>' refers the <i>matter of fact</i> to the court. It calls upon the court to say what are the circumstances of the case, and consequently to decide the <i>weight</i> of evidence, and to infer one fact from others, which is the peculiar province of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury is certainly to decide the facts; whether upon those facts the notice is reasonable, may be matter of law; but in Pennsylvania, and perhaps in other states, it is usual to submit the whole question to the jury, the court giving them information as to such points of law as have been decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the facts are settled, the court may give instruction as to the law; but if the question of law cannot be abstracted from the question of fact, the whole must be submitted to the jury. 1 <i>Dall.</i> 255. <i>Robertson</i> v. <i>Vogle.</i> 2 <i>Dall.</i> 158. <i>Bank</i> v. <i>M'Knight</i>. 2 <i>Dall.</i> 192. <i>Mallory</i> v. <i>Kirwan</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P.

A copy cannot be given in evidence until you have proved that the original existed, and is lost or destroyed, or not in the power of the party to produce; and then the copy must be proved by a witness who compared it with the original.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not appear that the plaintiff admitted the paper supposed to be a letter from <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i>, to be genuine, and simply not denying is not admitting. But the plaintiff objected to both the copy and the letter, as appears by the whole tenor of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

This was certainly proper. It was not praying the court to decide the <i>facts</i>, but only the law arising upon those facts.

The verity of that letter is acknowledged on the face of the bill of exceptions, and no cause is stated why it should not have been read to the jury. But the admission of the copy of a letter written by one of the defendants, stands upon totally different ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To introduce into a cause the copy of any paper, the truth of that copy must be established, and sufficient reasons for the non-production of the original must be shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If in this case the answer of <i>Smith &amp; Ridgeway</i> had authenticated the whole letter of <i>Carrington</i>, the copy of that letter need not have been offered, since its whole contents would have been proved by the answer to it. If its whole contents were not proved by the answer, then the part not so proved was totally unauthenticated, and may have formed no part of the originall letter. In this case, the answer cannot have authenticated the copy, because the bill states that the defendants gave <i>no proof</i> of its being true. This copy, therefore, not being proved to be a true copy, ought not to have gone before the jury. Into its importance or operation, this court cannot inquire. It was improper testimony, and a verdict founded on improper testimony cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this error the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the circuit court of Rhode-Island, to be again tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third exception is taken to the refusal of the court to give an opinion on a question, stated by the counsel for the plaintiffs. The difficulty of deciding on this exception does not arise from any doubt which ought to have been produced by the facts in the cause, but from the manner in which the question was propounded to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a long and complex statement of the <i>testimony</i>, the counsel for the plaintiffs requested the court to declare whether, 'if the plaintiffs had actually paid the said premium to the underwriters, before any notice of the change of the destination of the ship, they had a right, <i>under the circumstances of the case</i>, to recover the same of the defendant.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this question the court refused to give an answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt of the right of a party to require the opinion of the court on any point of law which is pertinent to the issue, nor that the refusal of the court to give such opinion furnishes cause for an exception; but it is equally clear that the court cannot be required to give to the jury an opinion on the <i>truth of testimony</i> in any case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the plaintiffs' counsel been content with the answer of the court to the question of law, he would have been entitled to that answer; but when he involved fact with law, and demanded the opinion of the court on the <i>force and truth of the testimony</i>, by adding the words 'under the circumstances of the case,' the question is so qualified as to be essentially changed; and although the court might with propriety have separated the law from the fact, and have stated the legal principle, leaving the fact to the jury, there was no obligation to make this discrimination, and consequently no error was committed in refusing to answer the question propounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also exhibits a part of the charge given to the jury, on which the counsel for the plaintiffs have argued as if it composed a part of the bill of exceptions.

In this case, the answer cannot have authenticated the copy, because the bill states that the defendants gave no proof of its being true.
