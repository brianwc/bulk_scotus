That\ngrowth required the State to redraw its electoral districts\nfor the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the\nState House of Representatives, in order to comply with\nthe Constitution’s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia\nv. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2 (2003). The State also\nhad to create new districts for the four additional congres-\n2                           PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nsional seats it received.\n   Texas is a “covered jurisdiction” under Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. See 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.\n§1973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends\nall changes to a covered jurisdiction’s election procedures,\nincluding district lines, until those changes are submitted\nto and approved by a three-judge United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney Gen-\neral. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 198 (2009). This process,\nknown as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction\nto demonstrate that its proposed change “neither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.” §1973c(a).\nThis Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map\ncannot be used to conduct an election until it has been\nprecleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652\n(1991).\n   The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas\nsubmitted them to the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance\nprocess remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its\nbid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the\ncoming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs—appellees\nhere—brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State’s\nnewly enacted plans violate the United States Constitu-\ntion and §2 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,\ninter alia, that Texas’ enacted plans discriminate against\nLatinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting\nstrength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and\nAfrican-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas’\n\n——————\n    1 Section\n            2 prohibits “any State or political subdivision” from impos-\ning any electoral practice “which results in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a).\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npopulation growth since 2000. A three-judge panel of the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. §2284. That court\nheard argument and held a trial with respect to the plain-\ntiffs’ claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution\nof the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch\nv. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283–285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   As Texas’ 2012 primaries approached, it became increas-\ningly likely that the State’s newly enacted plans would not\nreceive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And\nthe State’s old district lines could not be used, because\npopulation growth had rendered them inconsistent with\nthe Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. It\nthus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim\nplans for the State’s 2012 primaries and elections. See\nConnor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414–415 (1977). After\nreceiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive\nhearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court\nunanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but\nJudge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional\nand State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the\ninterim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were\nunnecessarily inconsistent with the State’s enacted plans.\nThis Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdic-\ntion. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n   Redistricting is “primarily the duty and responsibility\nof the State.” Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).\nThe failure of a State’s newly enacted plan to gain pre-\nclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by\nitself, require a court to take up the state legislature’s task.\nThat is because, in most circumstances, the State’s last\nenacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan\nreceives preclearance. But if an intervening event—most\ncommonly, as here, a census—renders the current plan\nunusable, a court must undertake the “unwelcome obliga-\n4                      PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntion” of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at 415.\nEven then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient\nstructure to the court’s endeavor. Where shifts in a\nState’s population have been relatively small, a court may\nneed to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the\nState’s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.\n   But here the scale of Texas’ population growth appears\nto require sweeping changes to the State’s current dis-\ntricts. In areas where population shifts are so large that\nno semblance of the existing plan’s district lines can be\nused, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an\ninterim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in\nadding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no\nsuggestion as to where those new districts should be\nplaced. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of\ndefining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistrict-\ning ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have\nbeen weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the\nexercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915–916 (1995); White v. Weiser,\n412 U. S. 783, 795–796 (1973). Thus, if the old state dis-\ntricts were the only source to which a district court could\nlook, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judg-\nments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.\n   To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise stand-\nardless decisions, a district court should take guidance\nfrom the State’s recently enacted plan in drafting an\ninterim plan. That plan reflects the State’s policy judg-\nments on where to place new districts and how to shift\nexisting ones in response to massive population growth.\nThis Court has observed before that “faced with the neces-\nsity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a\ngeneral rule, should be guided by the legislative policies\nunderlying” a state plan—even one that was itself unen-\nforceable—“to the extent those policies do not lead to\nviolations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.”\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nAbrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 79 (1997) (holding that\nthe District Court properly declined to defer to a pre-\ncleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For\nexample, in White, supra, an equal population challenge,\nthis Court reversed a District Court’s choice of interim\nplan, and required the District Court to choose a plan\nmore closely resembling an enacted state plan, even\nthough the state plan itself had been held to violate the\none-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v.\nSeamon, although the state plan as a whole had been\ndenied §5 preclearance, this Court directed a District\nCourt to “defer to the legislative judgments the [state]\nplans reflect,” insofar as they involved districts found to\nmeet the preclearance standard. 456 U. S. 37, 40–41\n(1982) (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403\nU. S. 124, 160–161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).\n   Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented\nif it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that\nthe plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it\nreflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an\ninterim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a\nstarting point for the district court. It provides important\nguidance that helps ensure that the district court appro-\npriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that\ncomply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act,\nwithout displacing legitimate state policy judgments with\nthe court’s own preferences.\n   A district court making such use of a State’s plan must,\nof course, take care not to incorporate into the interim\nplan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams,\nsupra, at 85–86; White, supra, at 797. Where a State’s\nplan faces challenges under the Constitution or §2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by\nthat plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are\nshown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plain-\ntiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must\n6                     PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nnormally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on\nthe merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20\n(2008). There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat\nthe policies behind a State’s redistricting legislation\nshould not also have to meet that standard. And because\nthe local district court—here, the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas—will ultimately decide the\nmerits of claims under §2 and the Constitution, it is well\nequipped to apply that familiar standard.\n   The calculus with respect to §5 challenges is somewhat\ndifferent. Where a State has sought preclearance in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, §5 allows only\nthat court to determine whether the state plan complies\nwith §5. Consistent with that design, we have made clear\nthat other district courts may not address the merits of §5\nchallenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,\n385 (1971). The local district court drafting an interim\nplan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits\nof the preclearance proceedings. The court should pre-\nsume neither that a State’s effort to preclear its plan will\nsucceed nor that it will fail.\n   The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance\nis satisfied by taking guidance from a State’s policy judg-\nments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that\nstand a reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 pre-\nclearance. And by “reasonable probability” this Court\nmeans in this context that the §5 challenge is not insub-\nstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not\ndeprived of important guidance provided by a state plan\ndue to §5 challenges that have no reasonable probability of\nsuccess but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative\nof those responsible for the preclearance determination.\nAnd the reasonable probability standard adequately bal-\nances the unique preclearance scheme with the State’s\nsovereignty and a district court’s need for policy guidance\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nin constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted\nthe “serious constitutional questions” raised by §5’s intru-\nsion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at\n204. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if §5\nrequired a district court to wholly ignore the State’s poli-\ncies in drawing maps that will govern a State’s elections,\nwithout any reason to believe those state policies are\nunlawful.\n  Appellees, however, contend that §5 demands exactly\nthat. In their view, this Court’s precedents require district\ncourts to ignore any state plan that has not received §5\npreclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely\nhold only that a district court may not adopt an unpre-\ncleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County,\n519 U. S. 9 (1996); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130\n(1981). They say nothing about whether a district court\nmay take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in\nsuch a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in\nUpham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the\nunobjectionable aspects of a State’s plan even though that\nplan had already been denied preclearance.\n  In this case, the District Court stated that it had\n“giv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the\nLegislature’s enacted map as possible.” 1 App. 182. At\nthe same time, however, the court said that it was re-\nquired to draw an “independent map” following “neutral\nprinciples that advance the interest of the collective public\ngood.” Id., at 169–170. In the court’s view, it “was not\nrequired to give any deference to the Legislature’s enacted\nplan,” and it instead applied principles that it determined\n“place the interests of the citizens of Texas first.” Id., at\n171. To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission\nto draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution\nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept\nof “the collective public good” for the Texas Legislature’s\ndetermination of which policies serve “the interests of the\n8                         PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\ncitizens of Texas,” the court erred.\n   In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map “with-\nout regard to political considerations,” the District Court\nrelied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001\nU. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)\n(per curiam), summarily aff’d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1\nApp. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted\nstate plan to which the District Court could turn. Without\nthe benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly\nlegislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was per-\nhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own\nnotion of the public good. Because the District Court here\nhad the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the\ncourt had neither the need nor the license to cast aside\nthat vital aid.\n   Some specific aspects of the District Court’s plans seem\nto pay adequate attention to the State’s policies, others do\nnot, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For exam-\nple, in drawing State House districts in North and East\nTexas, the District Court closely followed the State’s poli-\ncies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25–26. Although Texas’\nentire State House plan is challenged in the §5 proceed-\nings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the\ndistrict lines in North and East Texas have a discrimina-\ntory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court\nwas thus correct to take guidance from the State’s plan in\ndrawing the interim map for those regions. But the court\nthen altered those districts to achieve de minimis popula-\ntion variations—even though there was no claim that the\npopulation variations in those districts were unlawful.\nId., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in\nthis respect in the State’s plan, the District Court had no\nbasis to modify that plan.2\n——————\n  2 This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher\n\nstandard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting\nprecincts (called “voter tabulation districts” in Texas) in\ndrawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102–103. That\nchoice alone prevented the District Court from following\nthe lead of Texas’ enacted plan—which freely splits pre-\ncincts—in many areas where there were no legal chal-\nlenges to the plan’s details. See id., at 102–103, 116, n. 24.\nThe District Court was apparently motivated by a well-\nintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of\nreconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court’s\ninterim plan could be implemented in time for the upcom-\ning election. Id., at 90, 102–103, 109. But the State’s plan\naccepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accom-\nplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting\nprecincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n§42.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the\nburden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so\nis otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court\nto ignore the State’s decision. Of course, in this case it\nmay well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light\nof the exigencies caused by the impending election.\n   The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily\nignored the State’s plans in drawing certain individual\ndistricts. For example, the District Court drew an interim\nDistrict 77 that resembles neither the State’s newly enact-\ned plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010\ncensus. The court said that it did so in response to alleged\nconstitutional violations. 1 App. 174–175. But the court\ndid not say that those allegations were plausible, much\nless likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a\nfinding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a\n——————\nmaps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this\nCourt has also explained that those “stricter standard[s]” are not\ntriggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a\nState’s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42–\n43 (1982) (per curiam).\n10                    PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nreasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance,\nsee supra, at 6. Without such a determination, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no basis for drawing a district that does\nnot resemble any legislatively enacted plan.\n   The court’s approach in drawing other districts was\nunclear. The interim plan’s Congressional District 33, for\nexample, disregards aspects of the State’s plan that ap-\npear to be subject to strong challenges in the §5 proceed-\ning. See 3 id., at 600–601; 5 id., at 12–14. That much\nseems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with\nthe path the District Court followed from there. The\ncourt’s order suggests that it may have intentionally\ndrawn District 33 as a “minority coalition opportunity\ndistrict” in which the court expected two different minority\ngroups to band together to form an electoral majority.\n1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this\npoint—some portions suggest that the court deliberately\ndesigned such a district, other parts suggest that it drew\nthe district solely as a response to population growth in\nthe area. Compare id., at 146–147 (“Because much of the\ngrowth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex\nwas attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was\ndrawn as a minority coalition opportunity district”), with\nid., at 144 (“The Court has nowhere expressly sought to\nincrease the performance of any opportunity district above\nbenchmark”). If the District Court did set out to create a\nminority coalition district, rather than drawing a district\nthat simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for\ndoing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13–15\n(2009) (plurality opinion).\n   Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas followed the appropriate stand-\nards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elec-\ntions, the orders implementing those maps are vacated,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n              Cite as: 565 U.

That\ngrowth required the State to redraw its electoral districts\nfor the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the\nState House of Representatives, in order to comply with\nthe Constitution’s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia\nv. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2 (2003). The State also\nhad to create new districts for the four additional congres-\n2                           PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nsional seats it received.\n   Texas is a “covered jurisdiction” under Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. See 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.\n§1973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends\nall changes to a covered jurisdiction’s election procedures,\nincluding district lines, until those changes are submitted\nto and approved by a three-judge United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney Gen-\neral. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 198 (2009). This process,\nknown as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction\nto demonstrate that its proposed change “neither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.” §1973c(a).\nThis Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map\ncannot be used to conduct an election until it has been\nprecleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652\n(1991).\n   The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas\nsubmitted them to the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance\nprocess remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its\nbid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the\ncoming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs—appellees\nhere—brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State’s\nnewly enacted plans violate the United States Constitu-\ntion and §2 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,\ninter alia, that Texas’ enacted plans discriminate against\nLatinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting\nstrength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and\nAfrican-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas’\n\n——————\n    1 Section\n            2 prohibits “any State or political subdivision” from impos-\ning any electoral practice “which results in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.” 42 U.

A three-judge panel of the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. §2284. That court\nheard argument and held a trial with respect to the plain-\ntiffs’ claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution\nof the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch\nv. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283–285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   As Texas’ 2012 primaries approached, it became increas-\ningly likely that the State’s newly enacted plans would not\nreceive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And\nthe State’s old district lines could not be used, because\npopulation growth had rendered them inconsistent with\nthe Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. It\nthus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim\nplans for the State’s 2012 primaries and elections. See\nConnor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414–415 (1977). After\nreceiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive\nhearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court\nunanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but\nJudge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional\nand State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the\ninterim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were\nunnecessarily inconsistent with the State’s enacted plans.\nThis Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdic-\ntion. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n   Redistricting is “primarily the duty and responsibility\nof the State.” Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).\nThe failure of a State’s newly enacted plan to gain pre-\nclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by\nitself, require a court to take up the state legislature’s task.\nThat is because, in most circumstances, the State’s last\nenacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan\nreceives preclearance. But if an intervening event—most\ncommonly, as here, a census—renders the current plan\nunusable, a court must undertake the “unwelcome obliga-\n4                      PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntion” of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at 415.\nEven then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient\nstructure to the court’s endeavor. Where shifts in a\nState’s population have been relatively small, a court may\nneed to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the\nState’s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.\n   But here the scale of Texas’ population growth appears\nto require sweeping changes to the State’s current dis-\ntricts. In areas where population shifts are so large that\nno semblance of the existing plan’s district lines can be\nused, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an\ninterim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in\nadding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no\nsuggestion as to where those new districts should be\nplaced. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of\ndefining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistrict-\ning ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have\nbeen weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the\nexercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915–916 (1995); White v. Weiser,\n412 U. S. 783, 795–796 (1973). Thus, if the old state dis-\ntricts were the only source to which a district court could\nlook, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judg-\nments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.\n   To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise stand-\nardless decisions, a district court should take guidance\nfrom the State’s recently enacted plan in drafting an\ninterim plan. That plan reflects the State’s policy judg-\nments on where to place new districts and how to shift\nexisting ones in response to massive population growth.\nThis Court has observed before that “faced with the neces-\nsity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a\ngeneral rule, should be guided by the legislative policies\nunderlying” a state plan—even one that was itself unen-\nforceable—“to the extent those policies do not lead to\nviolations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.”\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nAbrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 79 (1997) (holding that\nthe District Court properly declined to defer to a pre-\ncleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For\nexample, in White, supra, an equal population challenge,\nthis Court reversed a District Court’s choice of interim\nplan, and required the District Court to choose a plan\nmore closely resembling an enacted state plan, even\nthough the state plan itself had been held to violate the\none-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v.\nSeamon, although the state plan as a whole had been\ndenied §5 preclearance, this Court directed a District\nCourt to “defer to the legislative judgments the [state]\nplans reflect,” insofar as they involved districts found to\nmeet the preclearance standard. 456 U. S. 37, 40–41\n(1982) (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403\nU. S. 124, 160–161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).\n   Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented\nif it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that\nthe plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it\nreflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an\ninterim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a\nstarting point for the district court. It provides important\nguidance that helps ensure that the district court appro-\npriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that\ncomply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act,\nwithout displacing legitimate state policy judgments with\nthe court’s own preferences.\n   A district court making such use of a State’s plan must,\nof course, take care not to incorporate into the interim\nplan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams,\nsupra, at 85–86; White, supra, at 797. Where a State’s\nplan faces challenges under the Constitution or §2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by\nthat plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are\nshown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plain-\ntiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must\n6                     PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nnormally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on\nthe merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20\n(2008). There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat\nthe policies behind a State’s redistricting legislation\nshould not also have to meet that standard. And because\nthe local district court—here, the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas—will ultimately decide the\nmerits of claims under §2 and the Constitution, it is well\nequipped to apply that familiar standard.\n   The calculus with respect to §5 challenges is somewhat\ndifferent. Where a State has sought preclearance in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, §5 allows only\nthat court to determine whether the state plan complies\nwith §5. Consistent with that design, we have made clear\nthat other district courts may not address the merits of §5\nchallenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,\n385 (1971). The local district court drafting an interim\nplan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits\nof the preclearance proceedings. The court should pre-\nsume neither that a State’s effort to preclear its plan will\nsucceed nor that it will fail.\n   The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance\nis satisfied by taking guidance from a State’s policy judg-\nments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that\nstand a reasonable probability of failing to gain §5 pre-\nclearance. And by “reasonable probability” this Court\nmeans in this context that the §5 challenge is not insub-\nstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not\ndeprived of important guidance provided by a state plan\ndue to §5 challenges that have no reasonable probability of\nsuccess but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative\nof those responsible for the preclearance determination.\nAnd the reasonable probability standard adequately bal-\nances the unique preclearance scheme with the State’s\nsovereignty and a district court’s need for policy guidance\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nin constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted\nthe “serious constitutional questions” raised by §5’s intru-\nsion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at\n204. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if §5\nrequired a district court to wholly ignore the State’s poli-\ncies in drawing maps that will govern a State’s elections,\nwithout any reason to believe those state policies are\nunlawful.\n  Appellees, however, contend that §5 demands exactly\nthat. In their view, this Court’s precedents require district\ncourts to ignore any state plan that has not received §5\npreclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely\nhold only that a district court may not adopt an unpre-\ncleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County,\n519 U. S. 9 (1996); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130\n(1981). They say nothing about whether a district court\nmay take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in\nsuch a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in\nUpham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the\nunobjectionable aspects of a State’s plan even though that\nplan had already been denied preclearance.\n  In this case, the District Court stated that it had\n“giv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the\nLegislature’s enacted map as possible.” 1 App. 182. At\nthe same time, however, the court said that it was re-\nquired to draw an “independent map” following “neutral\nprinciples that advance the interest of the collective public\ngood.” Id., at 169–170. In the court’s view, it “was not\nrequired to give any deference to the Legislature’s enacted\nplan,” and it instead applied principles that it determined\n“place the interests of the citizens of Texas first.” Id., at\n171. To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission\nto draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution\nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept\nof “the collective public good” for the Texas Legislature’s\ndetermination of which policies serve “the interests of the\n8                         PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\ncitizens of Texas,” the court erred.\n   In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map “with-\nout regard to political considerations,” the District Court\nrelied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001\nU. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)\n(per curiam), summarily aff’d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1\nApp. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted\nstate plan to which the District Court could turn. Without\nthe benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly\nlegislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was per-\nhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own\nnotion of the public good. Because the District Court here\nhad the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the\ncourt had neither the need nor the license to cast aside\nthat vital aid.\n   Some specific aspects of the District Court’s plans seem\nto pay adequate attention to the State’s policies, others do\nnot, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For exam-\nple, in drawing State House districts in North and East\nTexas, the District Court closely followed the State’s poli-\ncies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25–26. Although Texas’\nentire State House plan is challenged in the §5 proceed-\nings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the\ndistrict lines in North and East Texas have a discrimina-\ntory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court\nwas thus correct to take guidance from the State’s plan in\ndrawing the interim map for those regions. But the court\nthen altered those districts to achieve de minimis popula-\ntion variations—even though there was no claim that the\npopulation variations in those districts were unlawful.\nId., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in\nthis respect in the State’s plan, the District Court had no\nbasis to modify that plan.2\n——————\n  2 This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher\n\nstandard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting\nprecincts (called “voter tabulation districts” in Texas) in\ndrawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102–103. That\nchoice alone prevented the District Court from following\nthe lead of Texas’ enacted plan—which freely splits pre-\ncincts—in many areas where there were no legal chal-\nlenges to the plan’s details. See id., at 102–103, 116, n. 24.\nThe District Court was apparently motivated by a well-\nintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of\nreconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court’s\ninterim plan could be implemented in time for the upcom-\ning election. Id., at 90, 102–103, 109. But the State’s plan\naccepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accom-\nplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting\nprecincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n§42.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the\nburden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so\nis otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court\nto ignore the State’s decision. Of course, in this case it\nmay well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light\nof the exigencies caused by the impending election.\n   The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily\nignored the State’s plans in drawing certain individual\ndistricts. For example, the District Court drew an interim\nDistrict 77 that resembles neither the State’s newly enact-\ned plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010\ncensus. The court said that it did so in response to alleged\nconstitutional violations. 1 App. 174–175. But the court\ndid not say that those allegations were plausible, much\nless likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a\nfinding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a\n——————\nmaps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this\nCourt has also explained that those “stricter standard[s]” are not\ntriggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a\nState’s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42–\n43 (1982) (per curiam).\n10                    PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nreasonable probability of failing to gain §5 preclearance,\nsee supra, at 6. Without such a determination, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no basis for drawing a district that does\nnot resemble any legislatively enacted plan.\n   The court’s approach in drawing other districts was\nunclear. The interim plan’s Congressional District 33, for\nexample, disregards aspects of the State’s plan that ap-\npear to be subject to strong challenges in the §5 proceed-\ning. See 3 id., at 600–601; 5 id., at 12–14. That much\nseems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with\nthe path the District Court followed from there. The\ncourt’s order suggests that it may have intentionally\ndrawn District 33 as a “minority coalition opportunity\ndistrict” in which the court expected two different minority\ngroups to band together to form an electoral majority.\n1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this\npoint—some portions suggest that the court deliberately\ndesigned such a district, other parts suggest that it drew\nthe district solely as a response to population growth in\nthe area. Compare id., at 146–147 (“Because much of the\ngrowth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex\nwas attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was\ndrawn as a minority coalition opportunity district”), with\nid., at 144 (“The Court has nowhere expressly sought to\nincrease the performance of any opportunity district above\nbenchmark”). If the District Court did set out to create a\nminority coalition district, rather than drawing a district\nthat simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for\ndoing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13–15\n(2009) (plurality opinion).\n   Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas followed the appropriate stand-\nards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elec-\ntions, the orders implementing those maps are vacated,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n              Cite as: 565 U.
