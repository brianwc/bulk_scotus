At October term, 1851, the following stipulation was signed by the parties, and filed in the cause:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants agree not to deny the validity of the complainants' patent, provided they make out their title to the said letters-patent to be good.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They also agree not to deny that the machine complained of in the complainants' bill, is an infringement on the patent granted to H. Burden, on August 4, 1840. [Sept. 2.]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the complainants shall establish their title to the letters-patent aforesaid, the proper decree may be entered for the complainants, unless the defendants shall prove that the spike machine used by them, and complained of in the bill aforesaid, was constructed prior to the alleged application of H. Burden, made April 18, 1839, for letters-patent therefor, according to the provisions of the statute of the United States, 1839, ch. 88, sec. 7; or was the result of an independent, original invention, prior in time to the invention of the said Burden; in either of which cases the proper decree shall be entered for defendants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Curtis</i> for the appellants; no counsel appearing for the appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument upon the point upon which the court rested its decision, consisted of an examination of the evidence bearing upon it, which it is not necessary to state.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry Burden obtained a patent, in 1840, for a machine to make hook-headed spikes. He applied for the patent on the 18th of April, 1839. It was assigned to the Tory Iron and Nail Company, who filed a bill against the Odiornes, to enjoin them, and for an account for using a machine to make similar spikes; and which machine, it is alleged, infringed the monopoly secured to Burden, by his patent of 1840. The case was brought to a hearing on the following stipulation:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The defendants agree not to deny the validity of the complainant's patent, provided they make out their title to the said letters-patent to be good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'They also agree not to deny that the machine complained of in the complainant's bill, is an infringement on the patent granted to H.

The time at which this apparatus was attached to the machine (substantially complete in its operative parts,) is the time when the machine complained of was 'constructed,' in the sense of the stipulation; it not being necessary that the machine should be geared and doing work.
