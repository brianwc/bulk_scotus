Argued February 23, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010*\nIt is a federal crime to “knowingly provid[e] material support or re\n  sources to a foreign terrorist organization.” 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).\n  The authority to designate an entity a “foreign terrorist organization”\n  rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.\n  “[T]he term ‘material support or resources’ means any property, tan\n  gible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary in\n  struments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training,\n  expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or iden\n  tification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal sub\n  stances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or\n  include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious ma\n  terials.” §2339A(b)(1). Over the years, §2339B and the definition of\n  “material support or resources” have been amended, inter alia, to\n  clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group’s des\n  ignation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts,\n  §2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms “training,” §2339A(b)(2), “ex\n  pert advice or assistance,” §2339A(b)(3), and “personnel,” §2339B(h).\n     Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated “foreign\n  terrorist organization[s]” are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK)\n  and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to es\n  tablish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and\n  Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although both groups engage in political and\n  humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist\n  attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens. Claiming\n——————\n  * Together with No. 09–89, Humanitarian Law Project et al. v.\nHolder, Attorney General, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    they wish to support those groups’ lawful, nonviolent activities, two\n    U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs)\n    initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support stat\n    ute. The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history. Ulti\n    mately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the\n    material-support statute against plaintiffs. After the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certio\n    rari. The Court granted both petitions.\n       As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge §2339B’s prohibi\n    tion on providing four types of material support—“training,” “expert\n    advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—asserting violations\n    of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the ground that the\n    statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First\n    Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. They claim\n    that §2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging\n    in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use\n    international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK mem\n    bers to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies\n    for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living\n    in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.\nHeld: The material-support statute, §2339B, is constitutional as applied\n to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to\n foreign terrorist organizations. Pp. 8–36.\n    (a) This preenforcement challenge to §2339B is a justiciable Article\n III case or controversy. Plaintiffs face “a credible threat of prosecu\n tion” and “should not be required to await and undergo a criminal\n prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm\n Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. P. 10.\n    (b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga\n tion by accepting plaintiffs’ argument that the material-support stat\n ute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof\n that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization’s\n illegal activities. That reading is inconsistent with §2339B’s text,\n which prohibits “knowingly” providing material support and demon\n strates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization’s con\n nection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activi\n ties, as the necessary mental state for a violation. Plaintiffs’ reading\n is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding\n §2339B, which—unlike §2339B—do refer to intent to further terrorist\n activity. See §§2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1). Finally, there is no textual\n basis for plaintiffs’ argument that the same language in §2339B\n should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but\n not with regard to other forms of material support. Pp. 10–12.\n    (c) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not un\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nconstitutionally vague. The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plain\ntiffs’ vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, hold\ning that “training,” “service,” and a portion of “expert advice or assis\ntance” were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected\nspeech—regardless of whether those applications were clear. The\nCourt of Appeals also contravened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who en\ngages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of\nthe vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.” Hoff\nman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.\n   The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, “pro\nvide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohib\nited.” United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304. The statutory\nterms at issue here—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser\nvice,” and “personnel”—are quite different from the sorts of terms,\nlike “ ‘annoying’ ” and “ ‘indecent,’ ” that the Court has struck down for\nrequiring “wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,\nnarrowing context, or settled legal meanings.” Id., at 306. Congress\nhas increased the clarity of §2339B’s terms by adding narrowing\ndefinitions, and §2339B’s knowledge requirement further reduces any\npotential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.\n   Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dis\npositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plain\ntiffs’ proposed conduct. Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek\nto engage readily fall within the scope of “training” and “expert ad\nvice or assistance.” In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly\nused those terms to describe their own proposed activities. Plaintiffs’\nresort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of “training” and\n“expert advice or assistance” is beside the point because this litiga\ntion does not concern such situations. See Scales v. United States,\n367 U. S. 203, 223. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030,\n1049–1051, distinguished. Plaintiffs’ further contention, that the\nstatute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish\nto undertake, runs afoul of §2339B(h), which makes clear that “per\nsonnel” does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independ\nently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of\n“service,” which refers to concerted activity, not independent advo\ncacy. Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a\ncause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service “to a\nforeign terrorist organization.” §2339B(a)(1).\n   Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage\nis not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a person of ordinary\nintelligence would understand the term “service” to cover advocacy\nperformed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign ter\nrorist organization. Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the\n4             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or co\n    ordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a “service.” Be\n    cause plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the de\n    gree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK\n    and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement\n    challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Repub\n    lican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454. Pp. 13–20.\n       (d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not\n    violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 20–34.\n         (1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on\n    this question. Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure\n    political speech. That claim is unfounded because, under the mate\n    rial-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.\n    Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or member\n    ship in the PKK and LTTE. Rather, Congress has prohibited “mate\n    rial support,” which most often does not take the form of speech. And\n    when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\n    category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with\n    foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.\n    On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only\n    thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the cor\n    rect standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United\n    States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377. That standard is not used to\n    review a content-based regulation of speech, and §2339B regulates\n    plaintiffs’ speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its con\n    tent. Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a\n    regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering\n    coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.\n    Thus, the Court “must [apply] a more demanding standard” than the\n    one described in O’Brien. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403. Pp.\n    20–23.\n         (2) The parties agree that the Government’s interest in combat\n    ing terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs\n    argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech,\n    which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK\n    and LTTE. Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\n    segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terror\n    ism is an empirical question. Congress rejected plaintiffs’ position on\n    that question when it enacted §2339B, finding that “foreign organiza\n    tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\n    conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that\n    conduct.” §301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following §2339B. The record\n    confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs’ view. The\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nPKK and the LTTE are deadly groups. It is not difficult to conclude,\nas Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great\nthat working in coordination with them or at their command legiti\nmizes and furthers their terrorist means. Moreover, material sup\nport meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to\nadvance terrorism in multiple ways. The record shows that desig\nnated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\nfirewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or finan\ncial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and\nthose used to carry out terrorist attacks. Providing material support\nin any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to\nprevent terrorism and strain the United States’ relationships with its\nallies, including those that are defending themselves against violent\ninsurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups. Pp. 23–28.\n     (3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual infer\nences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive\nBranch’s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government\nagencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Con\ngress’s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organiza\ntions—even those for seemingly benign purposes—further those\ngroups’ terrorist activities. That evaluation of the facts, like Con\ngress’s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive na\ntional security and foreign relations interests at stake. The Court\ndoes not defer to the Government’s reading of the First Amendment.\nBut respect for the Government’s factual conclusions is appropriate\nin light of the courts’ lack of expertise with respect to national secu\nrity and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terror\nist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to ob\ntain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and\nconclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than\nconcrete evidence. The Court also finds it significant that Congress\nhas been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its ac\ntions may implicate constitutional concerns. Most importantly, Con\ngress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed\nany activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by for\neign terrorist groups. Given the sensitive interests in national secu\nrity and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have ade\nquately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material\nsupport in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services\nto foreign terrorist groups serves the Government’s interest in pre\nventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to pro\nmote only the groups’ nonviolent ends.\n   As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is\nwholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use in\n6             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in\n    formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat\n    egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\n    Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could\n    help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.\n    Plaintiffs’ proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of\n    Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot\n    prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide\n    whether any future applications of the material-support statute to\n    speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply\n    holds that §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied\n    to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.\n    28–34.\n         (e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs’ First\n    Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute\n    criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the\n    LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court’s precedents. The Ninth\n    Circuit correctly rejected this claim because §2339B does not penalize\n    mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist\n    groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs’ freedom of asso\n    ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for\n    eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the\n    same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

In\nparticular, they claim that the statute is too vague, in\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment, and that it infringes\ntheir rights to freedom of speech and association, in viola­\ntion of the First Amendment. We conclude that the mate­\nrial-support statute is constitutional as applied to the\nparticular activities plaintiffs have told us they wish to\npursue. We do not, however, address the resolution of\nmore difficult cases that may arise under the statute in\nthe future.\n                             I\n   This litigation concerns 18 U. S.

See id., at 1204.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138\n(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs’ speech and\nassociation claims, including their claim that §2339B\nviolated the First Amendment in barring them from con­\ntributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at\n1133–1136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that the terms “personnel” and “training”\nwere vague because it was “easy to imagine protected\nexpression that falls within the bounds” of those terms.\nId., at 1138; see id., at 1137.\n   With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the\naction returned to the District Court, and the parties\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits.

Con­\ngress also added the term “service” to the definition of\n“material support or resources,” §2339A(b)(1), and defined\n“training” to mean “instruction or teaching designed to\nimpart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,”\n§2339A(b)(2). It also defined “expert advice or assistance”\nto mean “advice or assistance derived from scientific,\ntechnical or other specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3).\nFinally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term “personnel”\nby providing:\n    “No person may be prosecuted under [§2339B] in con­\n    nection with the term ‘personnel’ unless that person\n    has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or con­\n    spired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with\n    1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself)\n    to work under that terrorist organization’s direction\n    or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or other­\n    wise direct the operation of that organization. Indi­\n    viduals who act entirely independently of the foreign\n    terrorist organization to advance its goals or objec­\n    tives shall not be considered to be working under the\n    foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”\n    §2339B(h).\n   Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc\nCourt of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs’ first action.\n393 F. 3d 902, 903 (CA9 2004). The en banc court af­\nfirmed the rejection of plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims\nfor the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit’s panel deci­\nsion in 2000. See ibid. In light of IRTPA, however, the en\nbanc court vacated the panel’s 2003 judgment with respect\nto vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for\nfurther proceedings. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit panel as­\nsigned to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs’ second action\n(relating to “expert advice or assistance”) also remanded in\nlight of IRTPA. See 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1139.\n8         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court consolidated the two actions on re­\nmand. See ibid. The court also allowed plaintiffs to chal­\nlenge the new term “service.” See id., at 1151, n. 24. The\nparties moved for summary judgment, and the District\nCourt granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness\ngrounds. See id., at 1156.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed once more. 552 F. 3d\n916, 933 (CA9 2009). The court first rejected plaintiffs’\nclaim that the material-support statute would violate due\nprocess unless it were read to require a specific intent to\nfurther the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee id., at 926–927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the\nstatute was not overbroad in violation of the First\nAmendment. See id., at 931–932. As for vagueness, the\nCourt of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a\n“facial vagueness challenge.” Id., at 929, n. 6. The court\nheld that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms “training,”\n“expert advice or assistance” (when derived from “other\nspecialized knowledge”), and “service” were vague because\nthey “continue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo­\ncacy,” but the term “personnel” was not vague because it\n“no longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment.” Id., at 929–931.\n   The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs\nfiled a conditional cross-petition. We granted both peti­\ntions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation,\nwe pause to clarify the questions before us. Plaintiffs\nchallenge §2339B’s prohibition on four types of material\nsupport—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser­\nvice,” and “personnel.” They raise three constitutional\nclaims. First, plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these\nfour statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs claim that §2339B violates their freedom of\nspeech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs\nclaim that §2339B violates their First Amendment free­\ndom of association.\n   Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in\nall their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that §2339B\nis invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in\ncertain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16–17,\nn. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those\nactivities are: (1) “train[ing] members of [the] PKK on how\nto use humanitarian and international law to peacefully\nresolve disputes”; (2) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on\nbehalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”; and (3) “teach[ing]\nPKK members how to petition various representative\nbodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at\n921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the\nother plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) “train[ing] mem­\nbers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related\naid to mediators and international bodies”; (2) “offer[ing]\ntheir legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements\nbetween the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government”; and\n(3) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils\nwho live in Sri Lanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1137.\n   Plaintiffs also state that “the LTTE was recently de­\nfeated militarily in Sri Lanka,” so “[m]uch of the support\nthe Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to\nprovide is now moot.” Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain­\ntiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE “as a political\norganization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of\nTamils.” Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at\noral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the\nLTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,\nbecause the LTTE now “has no role in Sri Lanka.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate\na peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwell. Thus, we do not consider the application of §2339B\nto those activities here.\n   One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of\na criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must\nbe sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under\nArticle III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face “a credi­\nble threat of prosecution” and “should not be required to\nawait and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole\nmeans of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442\nU. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.\n118, 128–129 (2007).\n   Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK\nand the LTTE before the enactment of §2339B and that\nthey would provide similar support again if the statute’s\nallegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.         See 309\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has\ncharged about 150 persons with violating §2339B, and\nthat several of those prosecutions involved the enforce­\nment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for\nGovernment 5. The Government has not argued to this\nCourt that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what\nthey say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. See\nBabbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop & Milav\netz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce­\nment challenge brought under the First Amendment).\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs’\nclaims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope\nafter 12 years of litigation).\n                            III\n  Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should\naffirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of\nconstitutional law. They contend that we should interpret\nthe material-support statute, when applied to speech, to\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire proof that a defendant intended to further a for­\neign terrorist organization’s illegal activities. That inter­\npretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain­\ntiffs’ proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do\nnot intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the\nLTTE.\n   We reject plaintiffs’ interpretation of §2339B because it\nis inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section\n2339B(a)(1) prohibits “knowingly” providing material\nsupport. It then specifically describes the type of knowl­\nedge that is required: “To violate this paragraph, a per­\nson must have knowledge that the organization is a\ndesignated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza­\ntion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or\nthat the organization has engaged or engages in terror­\nism. . . .” Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary\nmental state for a violation of §2339B, and it chose\nknowledge about the organization’s connection to terror­\nism, not specific intent to further the organization’s\nterrorist activities.\n   Plaintiffs’ interpretation is also untenable in light of the\nsections immediately surrounding §2339B, both of which\ndo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.           See\n§2339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who\n“provides material support or resources . . . knowing or\nintending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in\ncarrying out, a violation of” statutes prohibiting violent\nterrorist acts); §2339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for\none who “unlawfully and willfully provides or collects\nfunds with the intention that such funds be used, or with\nthe knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in\npart, in order to carry out” other unlawful acts). Congress\nenacted §2339A in 1994 and §2339C in 2002.                  See\n§120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (§2339A); §202(a), 116 Stat.\n724 (§2339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent\nlanguage of those provisions into §2339B, either when it\n12         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted §2339B in 1996, or when it clarified §2339B’s\nknowledge requirement in 2004.\n   Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue\nthat a specific intent requirement should apply only when\nthe material-support statute applies to speech. There is\nno basis whatever in the text of §2339B to read the same\nprovisions in that statute as requiring intent in some\ncircumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that\nplaintiffs are asking us not to interpret §2339B, but to\nrevise it. “Although this Court will often strain to con­\nstrue legislation so as to save it against constitutional\nattack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of\nperverting the purpose of a statute.” Scales v. United\nStates, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).\n   Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,\nbut it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the\nSmith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo­\ncating the violent overthrow of the government. The\nCourt held that a person could not be convicted under the\nstatute unless he had knowledge of the group’s illegal\nadvocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over­\nthrow. Id., at 220–222, 229. This action is different:\nSection 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro­\nhibits providing “material support” to such a group. See\ninfra, at 20–21, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the\nneed for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The\nCourt in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text\nand precedent that had interpreted closely related provi­\nsions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U. S.,\nat 209, 221–222. Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.\n   We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga­\ntion through plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of §2339B.3\n——————\n  3 The dissent would interpret the statute along the same lines as the\n\nplaintiffs, to prohibit speech and association “only when the defendant\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV\n   We turn to the question whether the material-support\nstatute, as applied to plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n“A conviction fails to comport with due process if the stat­\nute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of\nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is\nso standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously\ndiscriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams,\n553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute\nis vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for “[a]\nplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly\nproscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as\napplied to the conduct of others.” Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).\nWe have said that when a statute “interferes with the\nright of free speech or of association, a more stringent\nvagueness test should apply.” Id., at 499. “But ‘perfect\nclarity and precise guidance have never been required\neven of regulations that restrict expressive activity.’ ”\nWilliams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).\n   The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.\nInstead, the lower court merged plaintiffs’ vagueness\nchallenge with their First Amendment claims, holding\nthat portions of the material-support statute were uncon­\n——————\nknows or intends that those activities will assist the organization’s\nunlawful terrorist actions.” Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord­\ning to the dissent, this interpretation is “fairly possible” and adopting it\nwould avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The dissent’s interpretation of §2339B fails for essentially the\nsame reasons as plaintiffs’. Congress explained what “knowingly”\nmeans in §2339B, and it did not choose the dissent’s interpretation of\nthat term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement\nindistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in §§2339A and\n2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in\n§2339B.\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutionally vague because they applied to protected\nspeech—regardless of whether those applications were\nclear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary\nintelligence understood the scope of the term “training,”\nthat term would “remai[n] impermissibly vague” because\nit could “be read to encompass speech and advocacy pro­\ntected by the First Amendment.” 552 F. 3d, at 929. It also\nfound “service” and a portion of “expert advice or assis­\ntance” to be vague because those terms covered protected\nspeech. Id., at 929–930.\n   Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not\naddressing a “facial vagueness challenge,” id., at 929, n. 6,\nthe Court of Appeals considered the statute’s application\nto facts not before it. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied\non the Government’s statement that §2339B would bar\nfiling an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist\norganization—which plaintiffs have not told us they wish\nto do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs\nwished to do—to conclude that the statute barred pro­\ntected advocacy and was therefore vague. See id., at 930.\nBy deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical cir­\ncumstances, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of vagueness\nseemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment\noverbreadth doctrine. See id., at 929–930 (finding it “easy\nto imagine” protected expression that would be barred by\n§2339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 930\n(referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).\n   In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contra­\nvened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who engages in some\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the\nvagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.”\nHoffman Estates, supra, at 495. That rule makes no ex­\nception for conduct in the form of speech. See Parker v.\nLevy, 417 U. S. 733, 755–757 (1974). Thus, even to the\nextent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plain­\ntiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a suc­\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncessful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly\ncannot do so based on the speech of others. Such a plain­\ntiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First\nAmendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth\nAmendment vagueness challenge does not turn on\nwhether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected\nexpression. See Williams, supra, at 304; Hoffman Estates,\nsupra, at 494–495, 497. Otherwise the doctrines would be\nsubstantially redundant.\n   Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs’ claims of vagueness\nlack merit. Plaintiffs do not argue that the material­\nsupport statute grants too much enforcement discretion to\nthe Government. We therefore address only whether the\nstatute “provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 304.\n   As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here\nare quite different from the sorts of terms that we have\npreviously declared to be vague. We have in the past\n“struck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to\nwhether the defendant’s conduct was ‘annoying’ or ‘inde­\ncent’—wholly subjective judgments without statutory\ndefinitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.”\nId., at 306; see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S.\n156, n. 1 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that pun­\nished “vagrants,” defined to include “rogues and vaga­\nbonds,” “persons who use juggling,” and “common night\nwalkers” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying\nthe statutory terms in this action—“training,” “expert\nadvice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—does not\nrequire similarly untethered, subjective judgments.\n   Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to\nthe material-support statute over time. These definitions\nincreased the clarity of the statute’s terms.            See\n§2339A(b)(2) (“ ‘training’ means instruction or teaching\ndesigned to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general\n16        HOLDER v.

And the knowledge requirement\nof the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,\nas we have held with respect to other statutes containing a\nsimilar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,\n732 (2000); Posters ‘N’ Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511\nU. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455\nU. S., at 499.\n   Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may\nnot be clear in every application. But the dispositive point\nhere is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica­\ntion to plaintiffs’ proposed conduct, which means that\nplaintiffs’ vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming\nthat a heightened standard applies because the material­\nsupport statute potentially implicates speech, the statu­\ntory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114–115 (1972)\n(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that\nimplicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,\nat 223 (same).\n   Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage\nreadily fall within the scope of the terms “training” and\n“expert advice or assistance.” Plaintiffs want to “train\nmembers of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and\ninternational law to peacefully resolve disputes,” and\n“teach PKK members how to petition various representa­\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552\nF. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would\nunderstand that instruction on resolving disputes through\ninternational law falls within the statute’s definition of\n“training” because it imparts a “specific skill,” not “general\nknowledge.” §2339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs’ activities also fall\ncomfortably within the scope of “expert advice or assis­\ntance”: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe PKK how to petition for humanitarian relief before the\nUnited Nations involves advice derived from, as the stat­\nute puts it, “specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3). In fact,\nplaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms\n“training” and “expert advice” throughout this litigation to\ndescribe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that\nthese common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs’\nconduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,\n59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.\n   Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations\ndesigned to test the limits of “training” and “expert advice\nor assistance.” They argue that the statutory definitions\nof these terms use words of degree—like “specific,” “gen­\neral,” and “specialized”—and that it is difficult to apply\nthose definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain­\ntiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography\nwould constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen\ntile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we\nfound vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a\ncriminal case, when speaking to the press, “may state\nwithout elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .\ndefense.” Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Whatever force these arguments might have in the\nabstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not\npropose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek\nrefuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary\nbetween “specific skills” and “general knowledge.” See\nParker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this\npoint in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo­\nretical doubts regarding the distinction between “active”\nand “nominal” membership in an organization—also terms\nof degree—the defendant’s vagueness challenge failed\nbecause his “case present[ed] no such problem.” 367 U. S.,\nat 223.\n   Gentile was different. There the asserted vagueness in\na state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Court: Counsel had reason to suppose that his particu­\nlar statements to the press would not violate the rule, yet\nhe was disciplined nonetheless. See 501 U. S., at 1049–\n1051. We did not suggest that counsel could escape disci­\npline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly\nprohibited.\n   Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in\n“political advocacy” on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey\nand Tamils living in Sri Lanka. 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nThey are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded\nas “material support” in the form of providing “personnel”\nor “service[s],” and assert that the statute is unconstitu­\ntionally vague because they cannot tell.\n   As for “personnel,” Congress enacted a limiting defini­\ntion in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs’ vagueness concerns.\nProviding material support that constitutes “personnel” is\ndefined as knowingly providing a person “to work under\nthat terrorist organization’s direction or control or to\norganize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the op­\neration of that organization.” §2339B(h). The statute\nmakes clear that “personnel” does not cover independent\nadvocacy: “Individuals who act entirely independently of\nthe foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or\nobjectives shall not be considered to be working under the\nforeign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”\nIbid.\n   “[S]ervice” similarly refers to concerted activity, not\nindependent advocacy. See Webster’s Third New Interna­\ntional Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining “service” to mean\n“the performance of work commanded or paid for by an­\nother: a servant’s duty: attendance on a superior”; or “an\nact done for the benefit or at the command of another”).\nContext confirms that ordinary meaning here. The statute\nprohibits providing a service “to a foreign terrorist organi­\nzation.” §2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). The use of the\nword “to” indicates a connection between the service and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe foreign group. We think a person of ordinary intelli­\ngence would understand that independently advocating for\na cause is different from providing a service to a group\nthat is advocating for that cause.\n   Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terror­\nist group could be characterized as a “service,” the stat­\nute’s specific exclusion of independent activity in the\ndefinition of “personnel” would not make sense. Congress\nwould not have prohibited under “service” what it specifi­\ncally exempted from prohibition under “personnel.” The\nother types of material support listed in the statute, in­\ncluding “lodging,” “weapons,” “explosives,” and “transpor­\ntation,” §2339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could\nbe provided independently of a foreign terrorist organiza­\ntion. We interpret “service” along the same lines. Thus,\nany independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to\nengage is not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would understand the term\n“service” to cover advocacy performed in coordination with,\nor at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.\n   Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute\nposes difficult questions of exactly how much direction or\ncoordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a\n“service.” See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09–89,\np. 14 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (“Would any\ncommunication with any member be sufficient? With a\nleader? Must the ‘relationship’ have any formal elements,\nsuch as an employment or contractual relationship? What\nabout a relationship through an intermediary?”). The\nproblem with these questions is that they are entirely\nhypothetical. Plaintiffs have not provided any specific\narticulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate\ntheir advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE. They have\ninstead described the form of their intended advocacy only\nin the most general terms. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs\n10–11 (plaintiffs “would like, among other things, to offer\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the\nKurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations\nand the United States Congress” (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would\nlike to “write and distribute publications supportive of the\nPKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation” and “advocate\nfor the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey”).\n   Deciding whether activities described at such a level of\ngenerality would constitute prohibited “service[s]” under\nthe statute would require “sheer speculation”—which\nmeans that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforce­\nment challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Wash\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454 (2008).\nIt is apparent with respect to these claims that “grada­\ntions of fact or charge would make a difference as to\ncriminal liability,” and so “adjudication of the reach and\nconstitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact\nsituation.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 20 (1965).\n                              V\n\n                              A\n\n  We next consider whether the material-support statute,\nas applied to plaintiffs, violates the freedom of speech\nguaranteed by the First Amendment. Both plaintiffs and\nthe Government take extreme positions on this question.\nPlaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their “pure\npolitical speech.” E.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43. It has\nnot. Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may\nsay anything they wish on any topic. They may speak and\nwrite freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of\nTurkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international\nlaw. They may advocate before the United Nations. As\nthe Government states: “The statute does not prohibit\nindependent advocacy or expression of any kind.” Brief for\nGovernment 13. Section 2339B also “does not prevent\n[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nor impose any sanction on them for doing so.” Id., at 60.\nCongress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or\nopinions in the form of “pure political speech.” Rather,\nCongress has prohibited “material support,” which most\noften does not take the form of speech at all. And when it\ndoes, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\ncategory of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordi­\nnation with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be\nterrorist organizations.4\n   For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far,\nclaiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation\nis conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is directed at the\nfact of plaintiffs’ interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the\nGovernment contends, and only incidentally burdens their\nexpression. The Government argues that the proper\nstandard of review is therefore the one set out in United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). In that case, the\nCourt rejected a First Amendment challenge to a convic­\ntion under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying\ndraft cards, even though O’Brien had burned his card in\nprotest against the draft. See id., at 370, 376, 382. In so\ndoing, we applied what we have since called “intermediate\nscrutiny,” under which a “content-neutral regulation will\nbe sustained under the First Amendment if it advances\nimportant governmental interests unrelated to the sup­\npression of free speech and does not burden substantially\nmore speech than necessary to further those interests.”\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180,\n189 (1997) (citing O’Brien, supra, at 377).\n   The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at\n——————\n  4 The dissent also analyzes the statute as if it prohibited “[p]eaceful\n\npolitical advocacy” or “pure speech and association,” without more.\nPost, at 9, 17. Section 2339B does not do that, and we do not address\nthe constitutionality of any such prohibitions. The dissent’s claim that\nour decision is inconsistent with this Court’s cases analyzing those\nsorts of restrictions, post, at 11–12, is accordingly unfounded.\n22         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nissue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to\nargue that O’Brien provides the correct standard of re­\nview.5 O’Brien does not provide the applicable standard\nfor reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385–386 (1992); Texas\nv. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406–407 (1989), and\n§2339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain­\ntiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether\nthey may do so under §2339B depends on what they say.\nIf plaintiffs’ speech to those groups imparts a “specific\nskill” or communicates advice derived from “specialized\nknowledge”—for example, training on the use of interna­\ntional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations—\nthen it is barred. See Brief for Government 33–34. On the\nother hand, plaintiffs’ speech is not barred if it imparts\nonly general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.\n   The Government argues that §2339B should nonethe­\nless receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally\nfunctions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs\nheadlong into a number of our precedents, most promi­\nnently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen\nalso involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,\nbarring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when\nCohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an\nepithet, we did not apply O’Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.\nInstead, we recognized that the generally applicable law\n——————\n  5 The  Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs’\nactivities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the\nFirst Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi­\nnated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,\nlike the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;\nReply Brief for Government 31–32, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.\nEmpire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not\nconsider any such argument because the Government does not develop\nit: The Government’s submission is that applying §2339B to plaintiffs\ntriggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny—not that it triggers\nno First Amendment scrutiny at all.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu­\nnicated—he violated the breach of the peace statute be­\ncause of the offensive content of his particular message.\nWe accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re­\nversed his conviction. See id., at 18–19, 26.\n   This suit falls into the same category. The law here\nmay be described as directed at conduct, as the law in\nCohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap­\nplied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under\nthe statute consists of communicating a message. As we\nexplained in Texas v. Johnson: “If the [Government’s]\nregulation is not related to expression, then the less strin­\ngent standard we announced in United States v. O’Brien\nfor regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If\nit is, then we are outside of O’Brien’s test, and we must\n[apply] a more demanding standard.” 491 U. S., at 403\n(citation omitted).\n                              B\n   The First Amendment issue before us is more refined\nthan either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It\nis not whether the Government may prohibit pure political\nspeech, or may prohibit material support in the form of\nconduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro­\nhibit what plaintiffs want to do—provide material support\nto the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.\n   Everyone agrees that the Government’s interest in\ncombating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest\norder. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs’ complaint is\nthat the ban on material support, applied to what they\nwish to do, is not “necessary to further that interest.”\nIbid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify\nprohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their\nsupport will advance only the legitimate activities of the\ndesignated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.\nId., at 51–52.\n24        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\nsegregate support of their legitimate activities from sup­\nport of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en­\nacted §2339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings\nregarding the serious threat posed by international terror­\nism. See AEDPA §§301(a)(1)–(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). One\nof those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs’ contention\nthat their support would not further the terrorist activities\nof the PKK and LTTE: “[F]oreign organizations that en­\ngage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\nconduct that any contribution to such an organization\nfacilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7) (emphasis added).\n   Plaintiffs argue that the reference to “any contribution”\nin this finding meant only monetary support. There is no\nreason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly\nbecause Congress expressly prohibited so much more than\nmonetary support in §2339B. Congress’s use of the term\n“contribution” is best read to reflect a determination that\nany form of material support furnished “to” a foreign\nterrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely\nwhat the material-support statute does. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted §2339B, Congress simultaneously re­\nmoved an exception that had existed in §2339A(a) (1994\ned.) for the provision of material support in the form of\n“humanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved\nin” terrorist activity. AEDPA §323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205\nF. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful\naid would have no harmful effects.\n   We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject­\ning that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.\n“The PKK’s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000\nlives.” Declaration of Kenneth R.

Id., at 130–132; Brief for Government 6–7. “On\nJanuary 31, 1996, the LTTE exploded a truck bomb filled\nwith an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at the Cen­\ntral Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring\nmore than 1,400. This bombing was the most deadly\nterrorist incident in the world in 1996.” McKune Affida­\nvit, App. 131, ¶6.h. It is not difficult to conclude as Con­\ngress did that the “tain[t]” of such violent activities is so\ngreat that working in coordination with or at the com­\nmand of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and\nfurther their terrorist means. AEDPA §301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247.\n   Material support meant to “promot[e] peaceable, lawful\nconduct,” Brief for Plaintiffs 51, can further terrorism by\nforeign groups in multiple ways. “Material support” is a\nvaluable resource by definition. Such support frees up\nother resources within the organization that may be put to\nviolent ends. It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to\nforeign terrorist groups—legitimacy that makes it easier\nfor those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to\nraise funds—all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.\n“Terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\n‘firewalls’ that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and\ncommingling of support and benefits.” McKune Affidavit,\nApp. 135, ¶11. “[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror­\nist groups systematically conceal their activities behind\ncharitable, social, and political fronts.” M.

There is\nevidence that the PKK and the LTTE, in particular, have\nnot “respected the line between humanitarian and violent\nactivities.” McKune Affidavit, App. 135, ¶13 (discussing\nPKK); see id., at 134 (LTTE).\n   The dissent argues that there is “no natural stopping\nplace” for the proposition that aiding a foreign terrorist\norganization’s lawful activity promotes the terrorist or­\nganization as a whole.

The PKK and the LTTE have\ncommitted terrorist acts against American citizens abroad,\nand the material-support statute addresses acute foreign\npolicy concerns involving relationships with our Nation’s\nallies. See id., at 128–133, 137. We have noted that “nei­\nther the Members of this Court nor most federal judges\nbegin the day with briefings that may describe new and\nserious threats to our Nation and its people.” Boumediene\nv. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 797 (2008). It is vital in this con­\ntext “not to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence\nfor a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.”\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 68 (1981). See Wald,\n468 U. S., at 242; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981).\n   Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns\nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant\nabdication of the judicial role. We do not defer to the\nGovernment’s reading of the First Amendment, even when\nsuch interests are at stake. We are one with the dissent\nthat the Government’s “authority and expertise in these\nmatters do not automatically trump the Court’s own obli­\ngation to secure the protection that the Constitution\ngrants to individuals.” Post, at 23. But when it comes to\ncollecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this\narea, “the lack of competence on the part of the courts is\nmarked,” Rostker, supra, at 65, and respect for the Gov­\nernment’s conclusions is appropriate.\n   One reason for that respect is that national security and\nforeign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to\nconfront evolving threats in an area where information\ncan be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct\ndifficult to assess. The dissent slights these real con­\nstraints in demanding hard proof—with “detail,” “specific\nfacts,” and “specific evidence”—that plaintiffs’ proposed\nactivities will support terrorist attacks. See post, at 9, 16,\n30        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23. That would be a dangerous requirement. In this\ncontext, conclusions must often be based on informed\njudgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality\naffects what we may reasonably insist on from the Gov­\nernment. The material-support statute is, on its face, a\npreventive measure—it criminalizes not terrorist attacks\nthemselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to\noccur. The Government, when seeking to prevent immi­\nnent harms in the context of international affairs and\nnational security, is not required to conclusively link all\nthe pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its\nempirical conclusions. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S., at 17\n(“[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of\ncontemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . .\nmust of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it\ncustomarily wields in domestic areas”).\n   This context is different from that in decisions like\nCohen. In that case, the application of the statute turned\non the offensiveness of the speech at issue. Observing that\n“one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,” we invalidated\nCohen’s conviction in part because we concluded that\n“governmental officials cannot make principled distinc­\ntions in this area.” 403 U. S., at 25. In this litigation, by\ncontrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely posi­\ntioned to make principled distinctions between activities\nthat will further terrorist conduct and undermine United\nStates foreign policy, and those that will not.\n   We also find it significant that Congress has been con­\nscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions\nmay implicate constitutional concerns. First, §2339B only\napplies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nThere is, and always has been, a limited number of those\norganizations designated by the Executive Branch, see,\ne.g., 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997),\nand any groups so designated may seek judicial review of\nthe designation. Second, in response to the lower courts’\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nholdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the\nstatute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms\n“training,” “personnel,” and “expert advice or assistance,”\nas well as an explanation of the knowledge required to\nviolate §2339B. Third, in effectuating its stated intent not\nto abridge First Amendment rights, see §2339B(i), Con­\ngress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in\ncreating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.\nThe definition of material support, for example, excludes\nmedicine and religious materials. See §2339A(b)(1). In\nthis area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature’s\nsuperior capacity for weighing competing interests means\nthat “we must be particularly careful not to substitute our\njudgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.” Rost\nker, supra, at 68. Finally, and most importantly, Congress\nhas avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or\nindeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or\ncontrolled by foreign terrorist groups.\n  At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the consid­\nered judgment of Congress and the Executive that provid­\ning material support to a designated foreign terrorist\norganization—even seemingly benign support—bolsters\nthe terrorist activities of that organization. That judg­\nment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we\nhave persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given\nthe sensitive interests in national security and foreign\naffairs at stake, the political branches have adequately\nsubstantiated their determination that, to serve the Gov­\nernment’s interest in preventing terrorism, it was neces­\nsary to prohibit providing material support in the form of\ntraining, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign\nterrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote\nonly the groups’ nonviolent ends.\n  We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to\nundertake. First, plaintiffs propose to “train members of\n[the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international\n32        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to peacefully resolve disputes.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nCongress can, consistent with the First Amendment,\nprohibit this direct training. It is wholly foreseeable that\nthe PKK could use the “specific skill[s]” that plaintiffs\npropose to impart, §2339A(b)(2), as part of a broader\nstrategy to promote terrorism. The PKK could, for exam­\nple, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time\nto recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into\ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed at­\ntacks. See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The\nPKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286–295\n(2007) (describing the PKK’s suspension of armed struggle\nand subsequent return to violence). A foreign terrorist\norganization introduced to the structures of the interna­\ntional legal system might use the information to threaten,\nmanipulate, and disrupt. This possibility is real, not\nremote.\n   Second, plaintiffs propose to “teach PKK members how\nto petition various representative bodies such as the\nUnited Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. The\nGovernment acts within First Amendment strictures in\nbanning this proposed speech because it teaches the or­\nganization how to acquire “relief,” which plaintiffs never\ndefine with any specificity, and which could readily in­\nclude monetary aid. See Brief for Plaintiffs 10–11, 16–17,\nn. 10; App. 58–59, 80–81. Indeed, earlier in this litigation,\nplaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE “to present claims for\ntsunami-related aid to mediators and international bod­\nies,” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1, which naturally included\nmonetary relief. Money is fungible, supra, at 26, and\nCongress logically concluded that money a terrorist group\nsuch as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs\npropose to teach could be redirected to funding the group’s\nviolent activities.\n   Finally, plaintiffs propose to “engage in political advo­\ncacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,” and “engage\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri\nLanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. As explained above, su\npra, at 19–20, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level\nof coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what\nexactly their “advocacy” would consist of. Plaintiffs’ pro­\nposals are phrased at such a high level of generality that\nthey cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge. See\nsupra, at 20; Grange, 552 U. S., at 454; Zemel, 381 U. S.,\nat 20.\n   In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to ad­\ndress the real dangers at stake. It instead considers only\nthe possible benefits of plaintiffs’ proposed activities in the\nabstract. See post, at 13–15. The dissent seems unwilling\nto entertain the prospect that training and advising a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization on how to take\nadvantage of international entities might benefit that\norganization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activi­\nties. In the dissent’s world, such training is all to the\ngood. Congress and the Executive, however, have con­\ncluded that we live in a different world: one in which the\ndesignated foreign terrorist organizations “are so tainted\nby their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.” AEDPA §301(a)(7).\nOne in which, for example, “the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish\nrefugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come\nunder the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to\nrespect its ‘neutral and humanitarian nature.’ ” McKune\nAffidavit, App. 135–136, ¶13. Training and advice on how\nto work with the United Nations could readily have helped\nthe PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a\nbase for terrorist activities.\n   If only good can come from training our adversaries in\ninternational dispute resolution, presumably it would\nhave been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens\nfrom training the Japanese Government on using interna­\n34        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes\nduring World War II. It would, under the dissent’s rea­\nsoning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving\ndisputes through “ ‘deliberative forces,’ ” post, at 13 (quot­\ning Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that\nassisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort\nmore generally. That view is not one the First Amend­\nment requires us to embrace.\n   All this is not to say that any future applications of the\nmaterial-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur­\nvive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that\nany other statute relating to speech and terrorism would\nsatisfy the First Amendment. In particular, we in no way\nsuggest that a regulation of independent speech would\npass constitutional muster, even if the Government were\nto show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organi­\nzations. We also do not suggest that Congress could ex­\ntend the same prohibition on material support at issue\nhere to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in\nprohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs\nseek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, §2339B does\nnot violate the freedom of speech.\n                              VI\n  Plaintiffs’ final claim is that the material-support stat­\nute violates their freedom of association under the First\nAmendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminal­\nizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and\nthe LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De\nJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which\nwe have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist\nParty, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\nState of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,\n389 U. S. 258 (1967).\n  The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be­\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause the statute does not penalize mere association with\na foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put\nit: “The statute does not prohibit being a member of one of\nthe designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup­\nporting the political goals of the group. . . . What [§2339B]\nprohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .” 205\nF. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci­\nsions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as­\nsembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at\n262 (“It is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis­\ncriminately across all types of association with Commu­\nnist-action groups, without regard to the quality and\ndegree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First\nAmendment”); De Jonge, supra, at 362.\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute\nburdens their freedom of association because it prevents\nthem from providing support to designated foreign terror­\nist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for\nPlaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37–38. Any burden\non plaintiffs’ freedom of association in this regard is justi­\nfied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs’\nfree speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu­\ntion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of\nspeech that constitute material support, but did not per­\nmit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly\ndangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is\nnot required to ban material support to every group or\nnone at all.\n                        *   *    *\n  The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the\npeople of the United States ordained and established that\ncharter of government in part to “provide for the common\ndefence.” As Madison explained, “[s]ecurity against for­\neign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the\nAmerican Union.” The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J. Cooke\n36        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ned. 1961). We hold that, in regulating the particular forms\nof support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror­\nist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective\nconsistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth\nAmendments.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion\nthat the Constitution permits the Government to prose\ncute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated\nteaching and advocacy furthering the designated organiza\ntions’ lawful political objectives. In my view, the Govern\nment has not met its burden of showing that an interpre\ntation of the statute that would prohibit this speech- and\nassociation-related activity serves the Government’s com\npelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would\ninterpret the statute as normally placing activity of this\nkind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–347\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n2         HOLDER v.

S. C. §§2339B(a)(1), (g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). The\nSecretary of State has designated the Kurdistan Workers’\nParty (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n(LTTE) as “foreign terrorist organizations”—a designation\nauthorized where the organization is “foreign,” threatens\nthe security of the United States or its nationals, and\nengages in “terrorist activity,” defined to include “any” of\nsuch activities as “highjacking” and “assassination,” or the\n“use of . . . any . . . weapon or dangerous device . . . with\nintent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one\nor more individuals.” 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997); 8 U. S. C.\n§1182(a)(3)(B)(iii); 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).\n   The plaintiffs, all United States citizens or associations,\nnow seek an injunction and declaration providing that,\nwithout violating the statute, they can (1) “train members\nof [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and interna\ntional law to peacefully resolve disputes”; (2) “engage in\npolitical advocacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”;\n(3) “teach PKK members how to petition various represen\ntative bodies such as the United Nations for relief”; and (4)\n“engage in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live\nin Sri Lanka.” Humanitarian Law Project v. Mukasey, 552\nF. 3d 916, 921, n. 1 (CA9 2009); ante, at 9. All these ac\ntivities are of a kind that the First Amendment ordinarily\nprotects.\n   In my view, the Government has not made the strong\nshowing necessary to justify under the First Amendment\nthe criminal prosecution of those who engage in these\nactivities. All the activities involve the communication\nand advocacy of political ideas and lawful means of achiev\ning political ends. Even the subjects the plaintiffs wish to\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

We cannot avoid the constitu\ntional significance of these facts on the basis that some of\nthis speech takes place outside the United States and is\ndirected at foreign governments, for the activities also\ninvolve advocacy in this country directed to our govern\nment and its policies. The plaintiffs, for example, wish to\nwrite and distribute publications and to speak before the\nUnited States Congress. App. 58–59.\n   That this speech and association for political purposes is\nthe kind of activity to which the First Amendment ordi\nnarily offers its strongest protection is elementary. See\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269 (1964)\n(The First Amendment “ ‘was fashioned to assure unfet\ntered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of politi\ncal and social changes desired by the people’ ” (quoting\nRoth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957)); Lovell v.\nCity of Griffin, 303 U.

HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhere the PKK helps to coordinate a defendant’s activi\nties, ante, at 21, the simple fact of “coordination” alone\ncannot readily remove protection that the First Amend\nment would otherwise grant. That amendment, after all,\nalso protects the freedom of association. See NAACP v.\nClaiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 911 (1982) (The\nFirst Amendment’s protections “of speech, assembly,\nassociation, and petition, ‘though not identical, are insepa\nrable’ ” (quoting Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530\n(1945))); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353, 364 (1937)\n(describing the “right of peaceable assembly” as “a right\ncognate to those of free speech and free presses and . . .\nequally fundamental”); see also Roberts v. United States\nJaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622 (1984). “Coordination” with a\npolitical group, like membership, involves association.\n   “Coordination” with a group that engages in unlawful\nactivity also does not deprive the plaintiffs of the First\nAmendment’s protection under any traditional “categori\ncal” exception to its protection. The plaintiffs do not pro\npose to solicit a crime. They will not engage in fraud or\ndefamation or circulate obscenity. Cf. United States v.\nStevens, 559 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6) (de\nscribing “categories” of unprotected speech). And the First\nAmendment protects advocacy even of unlawful action so\nlong as that advocacy is not “directed to inciting or produc\ning imminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or\nproduce such action.” Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,\n447 (1969) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Here the plain\ntiffs seek to advocate peaceful, lawful action to secure\npolitical ends; and they seek to teach others how to do\nthe same. No one contends that the plaintiffs’ speech to\nthese organizations can be prohibited as incitement under\nBrandenburg.\n   Moreover, the Court has previously held that a person\nwho associates with a group that uses unlawful means to\nachieve its ends does not thereby necessarily forfeit the\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 203, 229 (1961)\n(“[Q]uasi-political parties or other groups that may em\nbrace both legal and illegal aims differ from a technical\nconspiracy, which is defined by its criminal purpose”); see\nalso NAACP, supra, at 908 (“The right to associate does\nnot lose all constitutional protection merely because some\nmembers of the group may have participated in conduct or\nadvocated doctrine that itself is not protected”). Rather,\nthe Court has pointed out in respect to associating with a\ngroup advocating overthrow of the Government through\nforce and violence: “If the persons assembling have com\nmitted crimes elsewhere . . . , they may be prosecuted for\ntheir . . . violation of valid laws. But it is a different mat\nter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such\noffenses, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable\nassembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a\ncriminal charge.” De Jonge, supra, at 365 (striking down\nconviction for attending and assisting at Communist Party\nmeeting because “[n]otwithstanding [the party’s] objec\ntives, the defendant still enjoyed his personal right of free\nspeech and to take part in peaceable assembly having a\nlawful purpose”).\n   Not even the “serious and deadly problem” of interna\ntional terrorism can require automatic forfeiture of First\nAmendment rights. §301(a)(1), 110 Stat. 1247, note fol\nlowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B. Cf. §2339B(i) (instructing\ncourts not to “constru[e] or appl[y the statute] so as to\nabridge the exercise of right guaranteed under the First\nAmendment”). After all, this Court has recognized that\nnot “ ‘[e]ven the war power . . . remove[s] constitutional\nlimitations safeguarding essential liberties.’ ”         United\nStates v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258, 264 (1967) (quoting Home\nBuilding & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 426\n(1934)). See also Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616,\n628 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“[A]s against dangers\n6         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npeculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the\nright to free speech is always the same”). Thus, there is\nno general First Amendment exception that applies here.\nIf the statute is constitutional in this context, it would\nhave to come with a strong justification attached.\n  It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the\nconstitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs’\nproposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme\ndiate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,\nbut “ ‘a more demanding standard.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989)). Indeed,\nwhere, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at\nleast arguably does so on the basis of content-based dis\ntinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute\nand justifications “strictly”—to determine whether the\nprohibition is justified by a “compelling” need that cannot\nbe “less restrictively” accommodated. See Houston v. Hill,\n482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (criminal penalties); Ashcroft v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002)\n(content-based); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.\nY. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118 (1991)\n(same); Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 540 (1980) (strict scru\ntiny); First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n786 (1978) (same).\n  But, even if we assume for argument’s sake that “strict\nscrutiny” does not apply, no one can deny that we must at\nthe very least “measure the validity of the means adopted\nby Congress against both the goal it has sought to achieve\nand the specific prohibitions of the First Amendment.”\nRobel, supra, 268, n. 20 (describing constitutional task\nwhere the Court is faced “with a clear conflict between a\nfederal statute enacted in the interests of national security\nand an individual’s exercise of his First Amendment\nrights”). And here I need go no further, for I doubt that\nthe statute, as the Government would interpret it, can\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

S. 180, 189 (1997) (describing intermediate scru\ntiny). Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528\nU. S. 377, 402 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring) (examining\nwhether a statute worked speech-related harm “out of\nproportion to the statute’s salutary effects upon” other\ninterests).\n\n   The Government does identify a compelling countervail\ning interest, namely, the interest in protecting the security\nof the United States and its nationals from the threats\nthat foreign terrorist organizations pose by denying those\norganizations financial and other fungible resources. I do\nnot dispute the importance of this interest. But I do dis\npute whether the interest can justify the statute’s criminal\nprohibition. To put the matter more specifically, precisely\nhow does application of the statute to the protected activi\nties before us help achieve that important security-related\nend? See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 118 (requiring\nthat “narrowly drawn” means further a “compelling state\ninterest” by the least restrictive means (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Turner, supra, at 189 (requiring “ad\nvance[ment of] important governmental interests unre\nlated to the suppression of free speech” without “bur\nden[ing] substantially more speech than necessary to\nfurther those interests”); Robel, supra, at 268, n. 20 (re\nquiring measurement of the “means adopted by Congress\nagainst . . . the [security] goal it has sought to achieve”).\nSee also Nixon, 528 U. S., at 402 (BREYER, J., concurring);\nFederal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,\n551 U. S. 449, 478 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (“A\ncourt . . . must ensure that [the interest justifying a stat\nutory restriction] supports each application of [the]\nstatute”).\n   The Government makes two efforts to answer this ques\n8         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion. First, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ sup\nport for these organizations is “fungible” in the same sense\nas other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the\nplaintiffs’ support could, for example, free up other re\nsources, which the organization might put to terrorist\nends. Brief for Respondents in No. 09–89, pp. 54–56 (here\ninafter Government Brief).\n   The proposition that the two very different kinds of\n“support” are “fungible,” however, is not obviously true.\nThere is no obvious way in which undertaking advocacy\nfor political change through peaceful means or teaching\nthe PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Na\ntions for political change is fungible with other resources\nthat might be put to more sinister ends in the way that\ndonations of money, food, or computer training are fungi\nble. It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities\ncan themselves be redirected, or will free other resources\nthat can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we\nmust determine whether the Government has come for\nward with evidence to support its claim.\n   The Government has provided us with no empirical\ninformation that might convincingly support this claim.\nInstead, the Government cites only to evidence that Con\ngress was concerned about the “fungible” nature in general\nof resources, predominately money and material goods. It\npoints to a congressional finding that “foreign organiza\ntions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by\ntheir criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247, note following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (emphasis\nadded). It also points to a House Report’s statement that\n“supply[ing] funds, goods, or services” would “hel[p] defray\nthe cost to the terrorist organization of running the osten\nsibly legitimate activities,” and “in turn fre[e] an equal\nsum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.” H. R.\nRep. No. 104–383, p. 81 (1995) (emphasis added). Finally,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Government refers to a State Department official’s\naffidavit describing how ostensibly charitable contribu\ntions have either been “redirected” to terrorist ends or,\neven if spent charitably, have “unencumber[ed] funds\nraised from other sources for use in facilitating violent,\nterrorist activities and gaining political support for these\nactivities.” Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134,\n136 (emphasis added).\n   The most one can say in the Government’s favor about\nthese statements is that they might be read as offering\nhighly general support for its argument. The statements\ndo not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs’\npolitical-advocacy-related activities might actually be\n“fungible” and therefore capable of being diverted to ter\nrorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was\nconcerned with “support” of this kind. The affidavit refers\nto “funds,” “financing,” and “goods”—none of which en\ncompasses the plaintiffs’ activities. Ibid. The statutory\nstatement and the House Report use broad terms like\n“contributions” and “services” that might be construed as\nencompassing the plaintiffs’ activities. But in context,\nthose terms are more naturally understood as referring to\ncontributions of goods, money, or training and other ser\nvices (say, computer programming) that could be diverted\nto, or free funding for, terrorist ends. See infra, at 15–16.\nPeaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into\nthese categories. And the statute itself suggests that\nCongress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or\nassociation. See §2339B(i) (“Nothing in this section shall\nbe construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of\nrights guaranteed under the First Amendment”); see also\ninfra, at 18–19.\n   Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ pro\nposed activities will “bolste[r] a terrorist organization’s\nefficacy and strength in a community” and “undermin[e]\nthis nation’s efforts to delegitimize and weaken those\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngroups.” Government Brief 56 (emphasis added). In the\nCourt’s view, too, the Constitution permits application of\nthe statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because\nthose activities could provide a group that engages in\nterrorism with “legitimacy.” Ante, at 25. The Court sug\ngests that, armed with this greater “legitimacy,” these\norganizations will more readily be able to obtain material\nsupport of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban—\nmoney, arms, lodging, and the like. See ibid.\n   Yet the Government does not claim that the statute\nforbids any speech “legitimating” a terrorist group.\nRather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership\nin terrorist organizations, (2) “peaceably assembling with\nmembers of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,” or\n(3) “independent advocacy” on behalf of these organiza\ntions. Government Brief 66, 61, 13. The Court, too, em\nphasizes that activities not “coordinated with” the terror\nist groups are not banned. See ante, at 21, 26, 31\n(emphasis added). And it argues that speaking, writing,\nand teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization’s\npeaceful political ends could “mak[e] it easier for those\ngroups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.”\nAnte, at 25.\n   But this “legitimacy” justification cannot by itself war\nrant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and asso\nciation. Speech, association, and related activities on\nbehalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to le\ngitimate that group. Thus, were the law to accept a “le\ngitimating” effect, in and of itself and without qualifica\ntion, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a\nban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold\ninstances where it should be won. Once one accepts this\nargument, there is no natural stopping place. The argu\nment applies as strongly to “independent” as to “coordi\nnated” advocacy. But see ante, at 26–27. That fact is\nreflected in part in the Government’s claim that the ban\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhere, so supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a desig\nnated group from filing on behalf of that group an amicus\nbrief before the United Nations or even before this Court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 47–49, 53.\n   That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a\nline designed to accept the legitimacy argument in some\ninstances but not in others. It is inordinately difficult to\ndistinguish when speech activity will and when it will not\ninitiate the chain of causation the Court suggests—a chain\nthat leads from peaceful advocacy to “legitimacy” to in\ncreased support for the group to an increased supply of\nmaterial goods that support its terrorist activities. Even\nwere we to find some such line of distinction, its applica\ntion would seem so inherently uncertain that it would\noften, perhaps always, “chill” protected speech beyond its\nboundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply\nin abstract terms and without limitation, must always, or\nit will never, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plain\ntiffs’ activities, “always” cannot possibly be the First\nAmendment’s answer.\n   Regardless, the “legitimacy” justification itself is incon\nsistent with critically important First Amendment case\nlaw. Consider the cases involving the protection the First\nAmendment offered those who joined the Communist\nParty intending only to further its peaceful activities. In\nthose cases, this Court took account of congressional find\nings that the Communist Party not only advocated theo\nretically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow\nof our Government through force and violence. The Court\nhad previously accepted Congress’ determinations that the\nAmerican Communist Party was a “Communist action\norganization” which (1) acted under the “control, direction,\nand discipline” of the world Communist movement, a\nmovement that sought to employ “espionage, sabotage,\nterrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to\nestablish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,” and (2)\n12        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“endeavor[ed]” to bring about “the overthrow of existing\ngovernments by . . . force if necessary.” Communist Party\nof United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367\nU. S. 1, 5–6 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment\nprotected an American’s right to belong to that party—\ndespite whatever “legitimating” effect membership might\nhave had—as long as the person did not share the party’s\nunlawful purposes. See, e.g., De Jonge, 299 U. S. 353;\nScales, 367 U. S., at 228–230; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384\nU. S. 11, 17 (1966); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.\nof State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605–610 (1967); Robel, 389\nU. S. 258 (holding that national security interests did not\njustify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of\nCommunist-affiliated organizations working in any de\nfense-related facility). As I have pointed out, those cases\ndraw further support from other cases permitting pure\nadvocacy of even the most unlawful activity—as long as\nthat advocacy is not “directed to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or produce\nsuch action.” Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447. The Gov\nernment’s “legitimating” theory would seem to apply to\nthese cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized,\nit would have led this Court to conclusions other than\nthose it reached.\n\n   Nor can the Government overcome these considerations\nsimply by narrowing the covered activities to those that\ninvolve coordinated, rather than independent, advocacy.\nConversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements\nmight well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related\nactivities here at issue (just as conversations and discus\nsions are a necessary part of membership in any organiza\ntion). The Government does not distinguish this kind of\n“coordination” from any other. I am not aware of any form\nof words that might be used to describe “coordination” that\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould not, at a minimum, seriously chill not only the kind\nof activities the plaintiffs raise before us, but also the\n“independent advocacy” the Government purports to per\nmit. And, as for the Government’s willingness to distin\nguish independent advocacy from coordinated advocacy,\nthe former is more likely, not less likely, to confer legiti\nmacy than the latter. Thus, other things being equal, the\ndistinction “coordination” makes is arbitrary in respect to\nfurthering the statute’s purposes. And a rule of law that\nfinds the “legitimacy” argument adequate in respect to the\nlatter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute\nthat sought to attack the former.\n   Consider the majority’s development of the Govern\nment’s themes. First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’\nproposal to “ ‘train members of [the] PKK on how to use\nhumanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve\ndisputes.’ ” Ante, at 31–32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1).\nThe majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in\nsignificant part on the ground that “peaceful negotia\ntion[s]” might just “bu[y] time . . . , lulling opponents into\ncomplacency.” Ante, at 32. And the PKK might use its\nnew information about “the structures of the international\nlegal system . . . to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.”\nIbid.\n   What is one to say about these arguments—arguments\nthat would deny First Amendment protection to the peace\nful teaching of international human rights law on the\nground that a little knowledge about “the international\nlegal system” is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent’s\nsubsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so\nlet’s not teach him how to try? What might be said of\nthese claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation com\nmitted to the resolution of disputes through “deliberative\nforces”? Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n   In my own view, the majority’s arguments stretch the\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconcept of “fungibility” beyond constitutional limits.\nNeither Congress nor the Government advanced these\nparticular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case\nin this Court—not Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652\n(1925), not Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919),\nnot Abrams, 250 U. S. 616, not the later Communist Party\ncases decided during the heat of the Cold War—in which\nthe Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or\nteaching might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating\ntime for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.\n    Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put\notherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is\nomnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more\nthan (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this\nkind of argument without more and to apply it to the\nteaching of a subject such as international human rights\nlaw is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitu\ntion’s text and First Amendment precedent, would auto\nmatically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case\nwhere national security interests conflict with the First\nAmendment. The Constitution does not allow all such\nconflicts to be decided in the Government’s favor.\n    The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its\narguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain\nfree to engage in the protected activity as long as it is not\n“coordinated.” That is because there is no practical way to\norganize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about\nhuman rights law) without “coordination.” Nor can the\nmajority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to\nsome special limiting circumstance present here. That is\nbecause the only evidence the majority offers to support its\ngeneral claim consists of a single reference to a book about\nterrorism, which the Government did not mention, and\nwhich apparently says no more than that at one time the\nPKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to\nit.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Second, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’ proposal to\n“ ‘teach PKK members how to petition various representa\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.’ ” Ante, at\n32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; emphasis added). The\nmajority’s only argument with respect to this proposal is\nthat the relief obtained “could readily include monetary\naid,” which the PKK might use to buy guns. Ante, at 32.\nThe majority misunderstands the word “relief.” In this\ncontext, as the record makes clear, the word “relief” does\nnot refer to “money.” It refers to recognition under the\nGeneva Conventions. See App. 57–58 (2003 Complaint);\nid., at 79–80 (1998 Complaint); id., at 113 (Fertig Declara\ntion); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs’ counsel deny\ning that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in\nthe form of money).\n    Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would\ndefer strongly to Congress’ “informed judgment.” See, e.g.,\nante, at 30. But here, there is no evidence that Congress\nhas made such a judgment regarding the specific activities\nat issue in these cases. See infra, at 20–21. In any event,\n“whenever the fundamental rights of free speech and\nassembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain\nopen [for judicial determination] whether there actually\ndid exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if\nany, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended\nwas one so substantial as to justify the stringent restric\ntion interposed by the legislature.” Whitney, supra, at\n378–379 (Brandeis, J., concurring). In such circum\nstances, the “judicial function commands analysis of\nwhether the specific conduct charged falls within the\nreach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is\nconsonant with the Constitution.” Landmark Communi\ncations, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 844 (1978). Hence,\na legislative declaration “does not preclude enquiry into\nthe question whether, at the time and under the circum\nstances, the conditions existed which are essential to\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvalidity under the Federal Constitution.” Whitney, supra,\nat 378; see also Landmark, supra, at 843 (“Deference to a\nlegislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First\nAmendment rights are at stake”).\n   I concede that the Government’s expertise in foreign\naffairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters,\ne.g., our relations with Turkey. Cf. ante, at 27–28. But it\nremains for this Court to decide whether the Government\nhas shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing\nspeech activity otherwise protected by the First Amend\nment. And the fact that other nations may like us less for\ngranting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the\nday.\n   Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Govern\nment nor the majority points to any specific facts that\nshow that the speech-related activities before us are fun\ngible in some special way or confer some special legitimacy\nupon the PKK. Rather, their arguments in this respect\nare general and speculative. Those arguments would\napply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual\npurpose group’s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether\nthe speech-related activity is coordinated). Both First\nAmendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent\nus from “sacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so\nspeculative a gain.” Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.\nv. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 127\n(1973); see also Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U. S., at 543\n(rejecting proffered state interest not supported in record\nbecause “[m]ere speculation of harm does not constitute a\ncompelling state interest”).\n                            II\n  For the reasons I have set forth, I believe application of\nthe statute as the Government interprets it would gravely\nand without adequate justification injure interests of the\nkind the First Amendment protects. Thus, there is “a\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nserious doubt” as to the statute’s constitutionality. Cro\nwell, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must\n“ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly\npossible by which the question may be avoided.” Ibid.; see\nalso Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78\n(1994); United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401\n(1916).\n  I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti\ntutional problem is “fairly possible.” In particular, I would\nread the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment\nprotected pure speech and association only when the\ndefendant knows or intends that those activities will assist\nthe organization’s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this\nreading, the Government would have to show, at a mini\nmum, that such defendants provided support that they\nknew was significantly likely to help the organization\npursue its unlawful terrorist aims.\n  A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is\naware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli\nhood that his or her conduct will materially support the\norganization’s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,\n164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code\n§2.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553\nU. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal\nCode §2.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95–605, pt. 1,\npp. 59–60 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite\nintent if it is his “conscious objective” (or purpose) to fur\nther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai\nley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code\n§§2.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (“When acting knowingly suffices\nto establish an element, such element also is established if\na person acts purposely”). On the other hand, for the\nreasons I have set out, see supra, at 9–12, knowledge or\nintent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncould or would help further terrorism simply by helping to\nlegitimate the organization is not sufficient.\n   This reading of the statute protects those who engage in\npure speech and association ordinarily protected by the\nFirst Amendment. But it does not protect that activity\nwhere a defendant purposefully intends it to help terror\nism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds him\nself to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to\nassist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these catego\nries of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist\nends, the act of providing material support to a known\nterrorist organization bears a close enough relation to\nterrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited\nnotwithstanding any First Amendment interest.              Cf.\nBrandenburg, 395 U. S. 444. At the same time, this read\ning does not require the Government to undertake the\ndifficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and\nnonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred;\nknowledge is enough. See Bailey, supra, at 405 (defining\nspecific intent).\n   This reading is consistent with the statute’s text. The\nstatute prohibits “knowingly provid[ing] material support\nor resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”\n§2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). Normally we read a crimi\nnal statute as applying a mens rea requirement to all of\nthe subsequently listed elements of the crime. See Flores-\nFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6–7). So read, the defendant would have to know or\nintend (1) that he is providing support or resources, (2)\nthat he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist\norganization, and (3) that he is providing support that is\nmaterial, meaning (4) that his support bears a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist ends.\n   This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute’s\nuse of the word “material.” That word can mean being of a\nphysical or worldly nature, but it also can mean “being of\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreal importance or great consequence.” Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1392 (1961). Here, it must\nmean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to\nphysical aid, would not apply to speech at all. See also\n§2339A(b)(1) (defining “ ‘material support or resources’ ” as\n“any property, tangible or intangible” (emphasis added)).\nAnd if the statute applies only to support that would likely\nbe of real importance or great consequence, it must have\nimportance or consequence in respect to the organization’s\nterrorist activities. That is because support that is not\nsignificantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes\nof this statute, neither has “importance” nor is of “great\nconsequence.”\n   The statutory definition of “material support” poses no\nproblem. The statute defines “material support” through\nreference to a list of terms, including those at issue here—\n“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “personnel,” and\n“service.” §2339B(g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). Since these latter\nterms all fall under the definition of the term “material\nsupport,” these activities fall within the statute’s scope\nonly when they too are “material.” Cf. Stevens, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S.\n1, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from\nthe term to be defined)).\n   Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that\nthe defendant knew the support was material can be read\nto require the Government to show that the defendant\nknew that the consequences of his acts had a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist, not\njust its lawful, aims.\n   I need not decide whether this is the only possible read\ning of the statute in cases where “material support” takes\nthe form of “currency,” “property,” “monetary instru\nments,” “financial securities,” “financial services,” “lodg\ning,” “safehouses,” “false documentation or identification,”\n“weapons,” “lethal substances,” or “explosives,” and the\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlike. §2339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more\nlikely to help an organization’s terrorist activities, either\ndirectly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to\nshow that an individual has provided support of those\nkinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum\ning the statute’s other requirements are met). But where\nsupport consists of pure speech or association, I would\nindulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government\nwould have to prove that the defendant knew he was\nproviding support significantly likely to help the organiza\ntion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,\nthat the defendant intended the support to be so used).\n   The statute’s history strongly supports this reading.\nThat history makes clear that Congress primarily sought\nto end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations\nof money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104–383, at\n38, 43–45, 81; supra, at 8–9. It shows that Congress,\nwhen referring to “expert services and assistance” for\nexample, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi\nble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex\npert’s giving “advice” that “facilitat[es] an aircraft hijack\ning” or an accountant’s giving “advice” that will “facilitate\nthe concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi\nties.” Hearing on Administration’s Draft Anti-Terrorism\nAct of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).\n   And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit\ntee, told the Senate:\n     “This bill also includes provisions making it a crime to\n     knowingly provide material support to the terrorist\n     functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden\n     tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.” 142\n     Cong.

As Part II makes clear,\nthere is a “serious” doubt—indeed, a “grave” doubt—about\nthe constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to\ncriminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at\n62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there\nfore must “read the statute to eliminate” that constitu\ntional “doub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly\ncontrary to the intent of Congress.” X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U. S., at 78.\n   For this reason, the majority’s statutory claim that\nCongress did not use the word “knowingly” as I would use\nit, ante, at 12–13, and n. 3, is beside the point. Our conse\nquent reading is consistent with the statute’s text; it is\nconsistent with Congress’ basic intent; it interprets but\ndoes not significantly add to what the statute otherwise\ncontains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo\ngraphs, 402 U. S. 363, 373–374 (1971) (constitutionally\ncompelled to add requirement that “forfeiture proceedings\nbe commenced within 14 days and completed within 60\ndays” despite absence of any statutory time limits); NLRB\nv.

I do not\nsee why the majority does not also remand the cases for\nconsideration of the plaintiffs’ activities relating to “advo\ncating” for the organizations’ peaceful causes. See ante, at\n19–20, 32–33.\n   The majority does not remand, apparently because it\nbelieves the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these\n“advocacy” claims are too general. It adds that the plain\ntiffs did not “suggest what exactly their ‘advocacy’ would\nconsist of.” Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about\nthe lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and\naffidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy\nthese groups have previously engaged in and in which\nthey would like to continue to engage. See App. 56–63,\n78–87, 95–99, 110–123.\n   Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern\nment’s argument that the plaintiffs’ speech-related activi\nties amount to “conduct” and should be reviewed as such.\nGovernment Brief 44–57. Hence, I should think the ma\njority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect\nof the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,\ne.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U. S. 346, 357–\n358 (2007); Johnson v. California 543 U. S. 499, 515\n(2005); cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware\nand must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to\nthe Executive and Legislative Branches the power to\nprovide for the national defense, and that it grants par\nticular authority to the President in matters of foreign\naffairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that\nauthority and expertise in these matters do not automati\ncally trump the Court’s own obligation to secure the pro\ntection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (“We have\nlong since made clear that a state of war is not a blank\ncheck . . . when it comes to the rights of th[is] Nation’s\ncitizens”). In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I\nbelieve the Court has failed to examine the Government’s\njustifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist\nupon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It\nhas failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling\nends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us\nof the protection that the First Amendment demands.\n   That is why, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 149008, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/06/21/Holder_v._Humanitarian_Law_Project.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 23, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010*\nIt is a federal crime to “knowingly provid[e] material support or re\n  sources to a foreign terrorist organization.” 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1).\n  The authority to designate an entity a “foreign terrorist organization”\n  rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.\n  “[T]he term ‘material support or resources’ means any property, tan\n  gible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary in\n  struments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training,\n  expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or iden\n  tification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal sub\n  stances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or\n  include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious ma\n  terials.” §2339A(b)(1). Over the years, §2339B and the definition of\n  “material support or resources” have been amended, inter alia, to\n  clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group’s des\n  ignation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts,\n  §2339B(a)(1); and to define the terms “training,” §2339A(b)(2), “ex\n  pert advice or assistance,” §2339A(b)(3), and “personnel,” §2339B(h).\n     Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated “foreign\n  terrorist organization[s]” are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK)\n  and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to es\n  tablish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and\n  Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although both groups engage in political and\n  humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist\n  attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens. Claiming\n——————\n  * Together with No. 09–89, Humanitarian Law Project et al. v.\nHolder, Attorney General, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    they wish to support those groups’ lawful, nonviolent activities, two\n    U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs)\n    initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support stat\n    ute. The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history. Ulti\n    mately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the\n    material-support statute against plaintiffs. After the Ninth Circuit\n    affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certio\n    rari. The Court granted both petitions.\n       As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge §2339B’s prohibi\n    tion on providing four types of material support—“training,” “expert\n    advice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—asserting violations\n    of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the ground that the\n    statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First\n    Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. They claim\n    that §2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging\n    in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use\n    international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK mem\n    bers to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies\n    for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living\n    in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.\nHeld: The material-support statute, §2339B, is constitutional as applied\n to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to\n foreign terrorist organizations. Pp. 8–36.\n    (a) This preenforcement challenge to §2339B is a justiciable Article\n III case or controversy. Plaintiffs face “a credible threat of prosecu\n tion” and “should not be required to await and undergo a criminal\n prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm\n Workers, 442 U. S. 289, 298. P. 10.\n    (b) The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga\n tion by accepting plaintiffs’ argument that the material-support stat\n ute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof\n that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization’s\n illegal activities. That reading is inconsistent with §2339B’s text,\n which prohibits “knowingly” providing material support and demon\n strates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization’s con\n nection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activi\n ties, as the necessary mental state for a violation. Plaintiffs’ reading\n is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding\n §2339B, which—unlike §2339B—do refer to intent to further terrorist\n activity. See §§2339A(a), 2339C(a)(1). Finally, there is no textual\n basis for plaintiffs’ argument that the same language in §2339B\n should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but\n not with regard to other forms of material support. Pp. 10–12.\n    (c) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not un\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nconstitutionally vague. The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plain\ntiffs’ vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, hold\ning that “training,” “service,” and a portion of “expert advice or assis\ntance” were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected\nspeech—regardless of whether those applications were clear. The\nCourt of Appeals also contravened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who en\ngages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of\nthe vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.” Hoff\nman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495.\n   The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, “pro\nvide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohib\nited.” United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304. The statutory\nterms at issue here—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser\nvice,” and “personnel”—are quite different from the sorts of terms,\nlike “ ‘annoying’ ” and “ ‘indecent,’ ” that the Court has struck down for\nrequiring “wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,\nnarrowing context, or settled legal meanings.” Id., at 306. Congress\nhas increased the clarity of §2339B’s terms by adding narrowing\ndefinitions, and §2339B’s knowledge requirement further reduces any\npotential for vagueness, see Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.\n   Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dis\npositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plain\ntiffs’ proposed conduct. Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek\nto engage readily fall within the scope of “training” and “expert ad\nvice or assistance.” In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly\nused those terms to describe their own proposed activities. Plaintiffs’\nresort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of “training” and\n“expert advice or assistance” is beside the point because this litiga\ntion does not concern such situations. See Scales v. United States,\n367 U. S. 203, 223. Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030,\n1049–1051, distinguished. Plaintiffs’ further contention, that the\nstatute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish\nto undertake, runs afoul of §2339B(h), which makes clear that “per\nsonnel” does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independ\nently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of\n“service,” which refers to concerted activity, not independent advo\ncacy. Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a\ncause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service “to a\nforeign terrorist organization.” §2339B(a)(1).\n   Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage\nis not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a person of ordinary\nintelligence would understand the term “service” to cover advocacy\nperformed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign ter\nrorist organization. Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the\n4             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or co\n    ordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a “service.” Be\n    cause plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the de\n    gree to which they seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK\n    and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement\n    challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Washington State Repub\n    lican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454. Pp. 13–20.\n       (d) As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not\n    violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 20–34.\n         (1) Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on\n    this question. Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure\n    political speech. That claim is unfounded because, under the mate\n    rial-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.\n    Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or member\n    ship in the PKK and LTTE. Rather, Congress has prohibited “mate\n    rial support,” which most often does not take the form of speech. And\n    when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\n    category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with\n    foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.\n    On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only\n    thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the cor\n    rect standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in United\n    States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377. That standard is not used to\n    review a content-based regulation of speech, and §2339B regulates\n    plaintiffs’ speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its con\n    tent. Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a\n    regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering\n    coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.\n    Thus, the Court “must [apply] a more demanding standard” than the\n    one described in O’Brien. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403. Pp.\n    20–23.\n         (2) The parties agree that the Government’s interest in combat\n    ing terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs\n    argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech,\n    which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK\n    and LTTE. Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\n    segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terror\n    ism is an empirical question. Congress rejected plaintiffs’ position on\n    that question when it enacted §2339B, finding that “foreign organiza\n    tions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\n    conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that\n    conduct.” §301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following §2339B. The record\n    confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs’ view. The\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nPKK and the LTTE are deadly groups. It is not difficult to conclude,\nas Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great\nthat working in coordination with them or at their command legiti\nmizes and furthers their terrorist means. Moreover, material sup\nport meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to\nadvance terrorism in multiple ways. The record shows that desig\nnated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\nfirewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or finan\ncial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and\nthose used to carry out terrorist attacks. Providing material support\nin any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to\nprevent terrorism and strain the United States’ relationships with its\nallies, including those that are defending themselves against violent\ninsurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups. Pp. 23–28.\n     (3) The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual infer\nences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive\nBranch’s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government\nagencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Con\ngress’s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organiza\ntions—even those for seemingly benign purposes—further those\ngroups’ terrorist activities. That evaluation of the facts, like Con\ngress’s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive na\ntional security and foreign relations interests at stake. The Court\ndoes not defer to the Government’s reading of the First Amendment.\nBut respect for the Government’s factual conclusions is appropriate\nin light of the courts’ lack of expertise with respect to national secu\nrity and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terror\nist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to ob\ntain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and\nconclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than\nconcrete evidence. The Court also finds it significant that Congress\nhas been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its ac\ntions may implicate constitutional concerns. Most importantly, Con\ngress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed\nany activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by for\neign terrorist groups. Given the sensitive interests in national secu\nrity and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have ade\nquately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material\nsupport in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services\nto foreign terrorist groups serves the Government’s interest in pre\nventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to pro\nmote only the groups’ nonviolent ends.\n   As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is\nwholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use in\n6             HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ternational law to resolve disputes would provide that group with in\n    formation and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strat\n    egy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\n    Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could\n    help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.\n    Plaintiffs’ proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of\n    Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot\n    prevail in this preenforcement challenge. The Court does not decide\n    whether any future applications of the material-support statute to\n    speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It simply\n    holds that §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied\n    to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide. Pp.\n    28–34.\n         (e) Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs’ First\n    Amendment freedom of association. Plaintiffs argue that the statute\n    criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the\n    LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court’s precedents. The Ninth\n    Circuit correctly rejected this claim because §2339B does not penalize\n    mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist\n    groups material support. Any burden on plaintiffs’ freedom of asso\n    ciation caused by preventing them from supporting designated for\n    eign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the\n    same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

S. C. §2339B(a)(1).\nThat prohibition is based on a finding that the specified\norganizations “are so tainted by their criminal conduct\nthat any contribution to such an organization facilitates\nthat conduct.” Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), §301(a)(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). The\nplaintiffs in this litigation seek to provide support to two\nsuch organizations. Plaintiffs claim that they seek to\nfacilitate only the lawful, nonviolent purposes of those\n2           HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngroups, and that applying the material-support law to\nprevent them from doing so violates the Constitution. In\nparticular, they claim that the statute is too vague, in\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment, and that it infringes\ntheir rights to freedom of speech and association, in viola­\ntion of the First Amendment. We conclude that the mate­\nrial-support statute is constitutional as applied to the\nparticular activities plaintiffs have told us they wish to\npursue. We do not, however, address the resolution of\nmore difficult cases that may arise under the statute in\nthe future.\n                             I\n   This litigation concerns 18 U. S. C. §2339B, which\nmakes it a federal crime to “knowingly provid[e] material\nsupport or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”1\nCongress has amended the definition of “material support\nor resources” periodically, but at present it is defined as\nfollows:\n       “[T]he term ‘material support or resources’ means any\n       property, tangible or intangible, or service, including\n       currency or monetary instruments or financial securi­\n       ties, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice\n       or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or\n       identification, communications equipment, facilities,\n       weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1\n——————\n    1 In\n       full, 18 U. S. C. §2339B(a)(1) provides: “UNLAWFUL CONDUCT.—\nWhoever knowingly provides material support or resources to a foreign\nterrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be fined\nunder this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both, and, if\nthe death of any person results, shall be imprisoned for any term of\nyears or for life. To violate this paragraph, a person must have knowl­\nedge that the organization is a designated terrorist organization . . .,\nthat the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . .,\nor that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism . . . .” The\nterms “terrorist activity” and “terrorism” are defined in 8 U. S. C.\n§1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), and 22 U. S. C. §2656f(d)(2), respectively.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

S. C.\n§§1189(a)(1), (d)(4). She may, in consultation with the\nSecretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, so\ndesignate an organization upon finding that it is foreign,\nengages in “terrorist activity” or “terrorism,” and thereby\n“threatens the security of United States nationals or the\nnational security of the United States.” §§1189(a)(1),\n(d)(4). “ ‘[N]ational security’ means the national defense,\nforeign relations, or economic interests of the United\nStates.” §1189(d)(2). An entity designated a foreign ter­\nrorist organization may seek review of that designation\nbefore the D. C. Circuit within 30 days of that designation.\n§1189(c)(1).\n  In 1997, the Secretary of State designated 30 groups as\nforeign terrorist organizations. See 62 Fed. Reg. 52650.\nTwo of those groups are the Kurdistan Workers’ Party\n(also known as the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan, or PKK)\nand the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The\nPKK is an organization founded in 1974 with the aim of\nestablishing an independent Kurdish state in southeast­\nern Turkey.       Humanitarian Law Project v. Reno, 9\nF. Supp. 2d 1176, 1180–1181 (CD Cal. 1998); Brief for\nPetitioners in No. 08–1498, p. 6 (hereinafter Brief for\nGovernment). The LTTE is an organization founded in\n1976 for the purpose of creating an independent Tamil\nstate in Sri Lanka. 9 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182; Brief for Gov­\nernment 6. The District Court in this action found that\nthe PKK and the LTTE engage in political and humanitar­\nian activities. See 9 F. Supp. 2d, at 1180–1182. The\nGovernment has presented evidence that both groups have\nalso committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which\n4            HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nhave harmed American citizens. See App. 128–133. The\nLTTE sought judicial review of its designation as a foreign\nterrorist organization; the D. C. Circuit upheld that desig­\nnation. See People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran v.\nDept. of State, 182 F. 3d 17, 18–19, 25 (1999). The PKK\ndid not challenge its designation. 9 F. Supp. 2d, at 1180.\n   Plaintiffs in this litigation are two U. S. citizens and six\ndomestic organizations: the Humanitarian Law Project\n(HLP) (a human rights organization with consultative\nstatus to the United Nations); Ralph Fertig (the HLP’s\npresident, and a retired administrative law judge); Na­\ngalingam Jeyalingam (a Tamil physician, born in Sri\nLanka and a naturalized U. S. citizen); and five nonprofit\ngroups dedicated to the interests of persons of Tamil de­\nscent. Brief for Petitioners in No. 09–89, pp. ii, 10 (here­\ninafter Brief for Plaintiffs); App. 48. In 1998, plaintiffs\nfiled suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality\nof the material-support statute, §2339B.              Plaintiffs\nclaimed that they wished to provide support for the hu­\nmanitarian and political activities of the PKK and the\nLTTE in the form of monetary contributions, other tangi­\nble aid, legal training, and political advocacy, but that\nthey could not do so for fear of prosecution under §2339B.\n9 F.

C. §2339B(a) (2000 ed.)\n\nprovided: “Whoever, within the United States or subject to the jurisdic­\ntion of the United States, knowingly provides material support or\nresources to a foreign terrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to\ndo so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10\nyears, or both.” See Humanitarian Law Project v. Reno, 9 F. Supp. 2d\n1205, 1207 (CD Cal. 1998). And 18 U. S. C. §2339A(b) (2000 ed.)\ndefined “material support or resources” to mean “currency or other\nfinancial securities, financial services, lodging, training, safehouses,\nfalse documentation or identification, communications equipment,\nfacilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel, transporta­\ntion, and other physical assets, except medicine or religious materials.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport statute was unconstitutional on two grounds:\nFirst, it violated their freedom of speech and freedom of\nassociation under the First Amendment, because it crimi­\nnalized their provision of material support to the PKK and\nthe LTTE, without requiring the Government to prove\nthat plaintiffs had a specific intent to further the unlawful\nends of those organizations. Id., at 1184. Second, plain­\ntiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.\nId., at 1184–1185.\n   Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the\nDistrict Court granted in part. The District Court held\nthat plaintiffs had not established a probability of success\non their First Amendment speech and association claims.\nSee id., at 1196–1197. But the court held that plaintiffs\nhad established a probability of success on their claim\nthat, as applied to them, the statutory terms “personnel”\nand “training” in the definition of “material support” were\nimpermissibly vague. See id., at 1204.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 205 F. 3d 1130, 1138\n(CA9 2000). The court rejected plaintiffs’ speech and\nassociation claims, including their claim that §2339B\nviolated the First Amendment in barring them from con­\ntributing money to the PKK and the LTTE. See id., at\n1133–1136. But the Court of Appeals agreed with the\nDistrict Court that the terms “personnel” and “training”\nwere vague because it was “easy to imagine protected\nexpression that falls within the bounds” of those terms.\nId., at 1138; see id., at 1137.\n   With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the\naction returned to the District Court, and the parties\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits. The District\nCourt entered a permanent injunction against applying to\nplaintiffs the bans on “personnel” and “training” support.\nSee No. CV–98–1971 ABC (BQRx), 2001 WL 36105333\n(CD Cal., Oct. 2, 2001). The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n352 F. 3d 382 (CA9 2003).\n6         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Meanwhile, in 2001, Congress amended the definition of\n“material support or resources” to add the term “expert\nadvice or assistance.” Uniting and Strengthening America\nby Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and\nObstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act),\n§805(a)(2)(B), 115 Stat. 377. In 2003, plaintiffs filed a\nsecond action challenging the constitutionality of that\nterm as applied to them. 309 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1192 (CD\nCal. 2004).\n   In that action, the Government argued that plaintiffs\nlacked standing and that their preenforcement claims\nwere not ripe. Id., at 1194. The District Court held that\nplaintiffs’ claims were justiciable because plaintiffs had\nsufficiently demonstrated a “genuine threat of imminent\nprosecution,” id., at 1195 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted), and because §2339B had the potential to chill plain­\ntiffs’ protected expression, see id., at 1197–1198. On the\nmerits, the District Court held that the term “expert ad­\nvice or assistance” was impermissibly vague. Id., at 1201.\nThe District Court rejected, however, plaintiffs’ First\nAmendment claims that the new term was substantially\noverbroad and criminalized associational speech. See id.,\nat 1202, 1203.\n   The parties cross-appealed. While the cross-appeals\nwere pending, the Ninth Circuit granted en banc rehear­\ning of the panel’s 2003 decision in plaintiffs’ first action\n(involving the terms “personnel” and “training”). See 382\nF. 3d 1154, 1155 (2004). The en banc court heard reargu­\nment on December 14, 2004. See 380 F. Supp. 2d 1134,\n1138 (CD Cal. 2005). Three days later, Congress again\namended §2339B and the definition of “material support\nor resources.” Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Preven­\ntion Act of 2004 (IRTPA), §6603, 118 Stat. 3762–3764.\n   In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary\nto violate §2339B, requiring knowledge of the foreign\ngroup’s designation as a terrorist organization or the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngroup’s commission of terrorist acts. §2339B(a)(1). Con­\ngress also added the term “service” to the definition of\n“material support or resources,” §2339A(b)(1), and defined\n“training” to mean “instruction or teaching designed to\nimpart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,”\n§2339A(b)(2). It also defined “expert advice or assistance”\nto mean “advice or assistance derived from scientific,\ntechnical or other specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3).\nFinally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term “personnel”\nby providing:\n    “No person may be prosecuted under [§2339B] in con­\n    nection with the term ‘personnel’ unless that person\n    has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or con­\n    spired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with\n    1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself)\n    to work under that terrorist organization’s direction\n    or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or other­\n    wise direct the operation of that organization. Indi­\n    viduals who act entirely independently of the foreign\n    terrorist organization to advance its goals or objec­\n    tives shall not be considered to be working under the\n    foreign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”\n    §2339B(h).\n   Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc\nCourt of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs’ first action.\n393 F. 3d 902, 903 (CA9 2004). The en banc court af­\nfirmed the rejection of plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims\nfor the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit’s panel deci­\nsion in 2000. See ibid. In light of IRTPA, however, the en\nbanc court vacated the panel’s 2003 judgment with respect\nto vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for\nfurther proceedings. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit panel as­\nsigned to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs’ second action\n(relating to “expert advice or assistance”) also remanded in\nlight of IRTPA. See 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1139.\n8         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court consolidated the two actions on re­\nmand. See ibid. The court also allowed plaintiffs to chal­\nlenge the new term “service.” See id., at 1151, n. 24. The\nparties moved for summary judgment, and the District\nCourt granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness\ngrounds. See id., at 1156.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed once more. 552 F. 3d\n916, 933 (CA9 2009). The court first rejected plaintiffs’\nclaim that the material-support statute would violate due\nprocess unless it were read to require a specific intent to\nfurther the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee id., at 926–927. The Ninth Circuit also held that the\nstatute was not overbroad in violation of the First\nAmendment. See id., at 931–932. As for vagueness, the\nCourt of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a\n“facial vagueness challenge.” Id., at 929, n. 6. The court\nheld that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms “training,”\n“expert advice or assistance” (when derived from “other\nspecialized knowledge”), and “service” were vague because\nthey “continue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advo­\ncacy,” but the term “personnel” was not vague because it\n“no longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment.” Id., at 929–931.\n   The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs\nfiled a conditional cross-petition. We granted both peti­\ntions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation,\nwe pause to clarify the questions before us. Plaintiffs\nchallenge §2339B’s prohibition on four types of material\nsupport—“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “ser­\nvice,” and “personnel.” They raise three constitutional\nclaims. First, plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these\nfour statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs claim that §2339B violates their freedom of\nspeech under the First Amendment. Third, plaintiffs\nclaim that §2339B violates their First Amendment free­\ndom of association.\n   Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in\nall their applications. Rather, plaintiffs claim that §2339B\nis invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in\ncertain specified activities. See Brief for Plaintiffs 16–17,\nn. 10. With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those\nactivities are: (1) “train[ing] members of [the] PKK on how\nto use humanitarian and international law to peacefully\nresolve disputes”; (2) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on\nbehalf of Kurds who live in Turkey”; and (3) “teach[ing]\nPKK members how to petition various representative\nbodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at\n921, n. 1; see 380 F. Supp. 2d, at 1136. With respect to the\nother plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) “train[ing] mem­\nbers of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related\naid to mediators and international bodies”; (2) “offer[ing]\ntheir legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements\nbetween the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government”; and\n(3) “engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils\nwho live in Sri Lanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; see 380\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1137.\n   Plaintiffs also state that “the LTTE was recently de­\nfeated militarily in Sri Lanka,” so “[m]uch of the support\nthe Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to\nprovide is now moot.” Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n. 5. Plain­\ntiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE “as a political\norganization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of\nTamils.” Ibid. Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at\noral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the\nLTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid,\nbecause the LTTE now “has no role in Sri Lanka.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate\na peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwell. Thus, we do not consider the application of §2339B\nto those activities here.\n   One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of\na criminal statute. Before addressing the merits, we must\nbe sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under\nArticle III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face “a credi­\nble threat of prosecution” and “should not be required to\nawait and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole\nmeans of seeking relief.” Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442\nU. S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S.\n118, 128–129 (2007).\n   Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK\nand the LTTE before the enactment of §2339B and that\nthey would provide similar support again if the statute’s\nallegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.         See 309\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1197. The Government tells us that it has\ncharged about 150 persons with violating §2339B, and\nthat several of those prosecutions involved the enforce­\nment of the statutory terms at issue here. See Brief for\nGovernment 5. The Government has not argued to this\nCourt that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what\nthey say they wish to do. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. See\nBabbitt, supra, at 302. See also Milavetz, Gallop & Milav\netz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforce­\nment challenge brought under the First Amendment).\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs’\nclaims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope\nafter 12 years of litigation).\n                            III\n  Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should\naffirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of\nconstitutional law. They contend that we should interpret\nthe material-support statute, when applied to speech, to\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire proof that a defendant intended to further a for­\neign terrorist organization’s illegal activities. That inter­\npretation, they say, would end the litigation because plain­\ntiffs’ proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do\nnot intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the\nLTTE.\n   We reject plaintiffs’ interpretation of §2339B because it\nis inconsistent with the text of the statute. Section\n2339B(a)(1) prohibits “knowingly” providing material\nsupport. It then specifically describes the type of knowl­\nedge that is required: “To violate this paragraph, a per­\nson must have knowledge that the organization is a\ndesignated terrorist organization . . ., that the organiza­\ntion has engaged or engages in terrorist activity . . ., or\nthat the organization has engaged or engages in terror­\nism. . . .” Ibid. Congress plainly spoke to the necessary\nmental state for a violation of §2339B, and it chose\nknowledge about the organization’s connection to terror­\nism, not specific intent to further the organization’s\nterrorist activities.\n   Plaintiffs’ interpretation is also untenable in light of the\nsections immediately surrounding §2339B, both of which\ndo refer to intent to further terrorist activity.           See\n§2339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who\n“provides material support or resources . . . knowing or\nintending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in\ncarrying out, a violation of” statutes prohibiting violent\nterrorist acts); §2339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for\none who “unlawfully and willfully provides or collects\nfunds with the intention that such funds be used, or with\nthe knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in\npart, in order to carry out” other unlawful acts). Congress\nenacted §2339A in 1994 and §2339C in 2002.                  See\n§120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (§2339A); §202(a), 116 Stat.\n724 (§2339C). Yet Congress did not import the intent\nlanguage of those provisions into §2339B, either when it\n12         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted §2339B in 1996, or when it clarified §2339B’s\nknowledge requirement in 2004.\n   Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue\nthat a specific intent requirement should apply only when\nthe material-support statute applies to speech. There is\nno basis whatever in the text of §2339B to read the same\nprovisions in that statute as requiring intent in some\ncircumstances but not others. It is therefore clear that\nplaintiffs are asking us not to interpret §2339B, but to\nrevise it. “Although this Court will often strain to con­\nstrue legislation so as to save it against constitutional\nattack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of\nperverting the purpose of a statute.” Scales v. United\nStates, 367 U. S. 203, 211 (1961).\n   Scales is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely,\nbut it is readily distinguishable. That case involved the\nSmith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advo­\ncating the violent overthrow of the government. The\nCourt held that a person could not be convicted under the\nstatute unless he had knowledge of the group’s illegal\nadvocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent over­\nthrow. Id., at 220–222, 229. This action is different:\nSection 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization. It instead pro­\nhibits providing “material support” to such a group. See\ninfra, at 20–21, 35. Nothing about Scales suggests the\nneed for a specific intent requirement in such a case. The\nCourt in Scales, moreover, relied on both statutory text\nand precedent that had interpreted closely related provi­\nsions of the Smith Act to require specific intent. 367 U.

Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.\n   We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litiga­\ntion through plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of §2339B.3\n——————\n  3 The dissent would interpret the statute along the same lines as the\n\nplaintiffs, to prohibit speech and association “only when the defendant\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Williams,\n553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). We consider whether a statute\nis vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for “[a]\nplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly\nproscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as\napplied to the conduct of others.” Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982).\nWe have said that when a statute “interferes with the\nright of free speech or of association, a more stringent\nvagueness test should apply.” Id., at 499. “But ‘perfect\nclarity and precise guidance have never been required\neven of regulations that restrict expressive activity.’ ”\nWilliams, supra, at 304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U. S. 781, 794 (1989)).\n   The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.\nInstead, the lower court merged plaintiffs’ vagueness\nchallenge with their First Amendment claims, holding\nthat portions of the material-support statute were uncon­\n——————\nknows or intends that those activities will assist the organization’s\nunlawful terrorist actions.” Post, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Accord­\ning to the dissent, this interpretation is “fairly possible” and adopting it\nwould avoid constitutional concerns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The dissent’s interpretation of §2339B fails for essentially the\nsame reasons as plaintiffs’. Congress explained what “knowingly”\nmeans in §2339B, and it did not choose the dissent’s interpretation of\nthat term. In fact, the dissent proposes a mental-state requirement\nindistinguishable from the one Congress adopted in §§2339A and\n2339C, even though Congress used markedly different language in\n§2339B.\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutionally vague because they applied to protected\nspeech—regardless of whether those applications were\nclear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary\nintelligence understood the scope of the term “training,”\nthat term would “remai[n] impermissibly vague” because\nit could “be read to encompass speech and advocacy pro­\ntected by the First Amendment.” 552 F. 3d, at 929. It also\nfound “service” and a portion of “expert advice or assis­\ntance” to be vague because those terms covered protected\nspeech. Id., at 929–930.\n   Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not\naddressing a “facial vagueness challenge,” id., at 929, n. 6,\nthe Court of Appeals considered the statute’s application\nto facts not before it. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied\non the Government’s statement that §2339B would bar\nfiling an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist\norganization—which plaintiffs have not told us they wish\nto do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs\nwished to do—to conclude that the statute barred pro­\ntected advocacy and was therefore vague. See id., at 930.\nBy deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical cir­\ncumstances, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of vagueness\nseemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment\noverbreadth doctrine. See id., at 929–930 (finding it “easy\nto imagine” protected expression that would be barred by\n§2339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 930\n(referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).\n   In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contra­\nvened the rule that “[a] plaintiff who engages in some\nconduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the\nvagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.”\nHoffman Estates, supra, at 495. That rule makes no ex­\nception for conduct in the form of speech. See Parker v.\nLevy, 417 U. S. 733, 755–757 (1974). Thus, even to the\nextent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plain­\ntiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a suc­\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncessful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly\ncannot do so based on the speech of others. Such a plain­\ntiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First\nAmendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth\nAmendment vagueness challenge does not turn on\nwhether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected\nexpression. See Williams, supra, at 304; Hoffman Estates,\nsupra, at 494–495, 497. Otherwise the doctrines would be\nsubstantially redundant.\n   Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs’ claims of vagueness\nlack merit. Plaintiffs do not argue that the material­\nsupport statute grants too much enforcement discretion to\nthe Government. We therefore address only whether the\nstatute “provide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 304.\n   As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here\nare quite different from the sorts of terms that we have\npreviously declared to be vague. We have in the past\n“struck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to\nwhether the defendant’s conduct was ‘annoying’ or ‘inde­\ncent’—wholly subjective judgments without statutory\ndefinitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.”\nId., at 306; see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S.\n156, n. 1 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that pun­\nished “vagrants,” defined to include “rogues and vaga­\nbonds,” “persons who use juggling,” and “common night\nwalkers” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Applying\nthe statutory terms in this action—“training,” “expert\nadvice or assistance,” “service,” and “personnel”—does not\nrequire similarly untethered, subjective judgments.\n   Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to\nthe material-support statute over time. These definitions\nincreased the clarity of the statute’s terms.            See\n§2339A(b)(2) (“ ‘training’ means instruction or teaching\ndesigned to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge”); §2339A(b)(3) (“ ‘expert advice or assistance’\nmeans advice or assistance derived from scientific, techni­\ncal or other specialized knowledge”); §2339B(h) (clarifying\nthe scope of “personnel”). And the knowledge requirement\nof the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness,\nas we have held with respect to other statutes containing a\nsimilar requirement. See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703,\n732 (2000); Posters ‘N’ Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511\nU. S. 513, 523, 526 (1994); see also Hoffman Estates, 455\nU. S., at 499.\n   Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may\nnot be clear in every application. But the dispositive point\nhere is that the statutory terms are clear in their applica­\ntion to plaintiffs’ proposed conduct, which means that\nplaintiffs’ vagueness challenge must fail. Even assuming\nthat a heightened standard applies because the material­\nsupport statute potentially implicates speech, the statu­\ntory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs. See\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 114–115 (1972)\n(rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that\nimplicated First Amendment activities); Scales, 367 U. S.,\nat 223 (same).\n   Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage\nreadily fall within the scope of the terms “training” and\n“expert advice or assistance.” Plaintiffs want to “train\nmembers of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and\ninternational law to peacefully resolve disputes,” and\n“teach PKK members how to petition various representa­\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 552\nF. 3d, at 921, n. 1. A person of ordinary intelligence would\nunderstand that instruction on resolving disputes through\ninternational law falls within the statute’s definition of\n“training” because it imparts a “specific skill,” not “general\nknowledge.” §2339A(b)(2). Plaintiffs’ activities also fall\ncomfortably within the scope of “expert advice or assis­\ntance”: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe PKK how to petition for humanitarian relief before the\nUnited Nations involves advice derived from, as the stat­\nute puts it, “specialized knowledge.” §2339A(b)(3). In fact,\nplaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms\n“training” and “expert advice” throughout this litigation to\ndescribe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that\nthese common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs’\nconduct. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58,\n59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.\n   Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations\ndesigned to test the limits of “training” and “expert advice\nor assistance.” They argue that the statutory definitions\nof these terms use words of degree—like “specific,” “gen­\neral,” and “specialized”—and that it is difficult to apply\nthose definitions in particular cases. See Brief for Plain­\ntiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography\nwould constitute training); id., at 29. And they cite Gen\ntile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030 (1991), in which we\nfound vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a\ncriminal case, when speaking to the press, “may state\nwithout elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . .\ndefense.” Id., at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Whatever force these arguments might have in the\nabstract, they are beside the point here. Plaintiffs do not\npropose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek\nrefuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary\nbetween “specific skills” and “general knowledge.” See\nParker v. Levy, 417 U. S., at 756. We emphasized this\npoint in Scales, holding that even if there might be theo­\nretical doubts regarding the distinction between “active”\nand “nominal” membership in an organization—also terms\nof degree—the defendant’s vagueness challenge failed\nbecause his “case present[ed] no such problem.” 367 U. S.,\nat 223.\n   Gentile was different. There the asserted vagueness in\na state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Court: Counsel had reason to suppose that his particu­\nlar statements to the press would not violate the rule, yet\nhe was disciplined nonetheless. See 501 U. S., at 1049–\n1051. We did not suggest that counsel could escape disci­\npline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly\nprohibited.\n   Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in\n“political advocacy” on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey\nand Tamils living in Sri Lanka. 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nThey are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded\nas “material support” in the form of providing “personnel”\nor “service[s],” and assert that the statute is unconstitu­\ntionally vague because they cannot tell.\n   As for “personnel,” Congress enacted a limiting defini­\ntion in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs’ vagueness concerns.\nProviding material support that constitutes “personnel” is\ndefined as knowingly providing a person “to work under\nthat terrorist organization’s direction or control or to\norganize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the op­\neration of that organization.” §2339B(h). The statute\nmakes clear that “personnel” does not cover independent\nadvocacy: “Individuals who act entirely independently of\nthe foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or\nobjectives shall not be considered to be working under the\nforeign terrorist organization’s direction and control.”\nIbid.\n   “[S]ervice” similarly refers to concerted activity, not\nindependent advocacy. See Webster’s Third New Interna­\ntional Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining “service” to mean\n“the performance of work commanded or paid for by an­\nother: a servant’s duty: attendance on a superior”; or “an\nact done for the benefit or at the command of another”).\nContext confirms that ordinary meaning here. The statute\nprohibits providing a service “to a foreign terrorist organi­\nzation.” §2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). The use of the\nword “to” indicates a connection between the service and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe foreign group. We think a person of ordinary intelli­\ngence would understand that independently advocating for\na cause is different from providing a service to a group\nthat is advocating for that cause.\n   Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terror­\nist group could be characterized as a “service,” the stat­\nute’s specific exclusion of independent activity in the\ndefinition of “personnel” would not make sense. Congress\nwould not have prohibited under “service” what it specifi­\ncally exempted from prohibition under “personnel.” The\nother types of material support listed in the statute, in­\ncluding “lodging,” “weapons,” “explosives,” and “transpor­\ntation,” §2339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could\nbe provided independently of a foreign terrorist organiza­\ntion. We interpret “service” along the same lines. Thus,\nany independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to\nengage is not prohibited by §2339B. On the other hand, a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would understand the term\n“service” to cover advocacy performed in coordination with,\nor at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.\n   Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute\nposes difficult questions of exactly how much direction or\ncoordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a\n“service.” See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09–89,\np. 14 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (“Would any\ncommunication with any member be sufficient? With a\nleader? Must the ‘relationship’ have any formal elements,\nsuch as an employment or contractual relationship? What\nabout a relationship through an intermediary?”). The\nproblem with these questions is that they are entirely\nhypothetical. Plaintiffs have not provided any specific\narticulation of the degree to which they seek to coordinate\ntheir advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE. They have\ninstead described the form of their intended advocacy only\nin the most general terms. See, e.g., Brief for Plaintiffs\n10–11 (plaintiffs “would like, among other things, to offer\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntheir services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the\nKurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations\nand the United States Congress” (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would\nlike to “write and distribute publications supportive of the\nPKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation” and “advocate\nfor the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey”).\n   Deciding whether activities described at such a level of\ngenerality would constitute prohibited “service[s]” under\nthe statute would require “sheer speculation”—which\nmeans that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforce­\nment challenge. See Washington State Grange v. Wash\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 454 (2008).\nIt is apparent with respect to these claims that “grada­\ntions of fact or charge would make a difference as to\ncriminal liability,” and so “adjudication of the reach and\nconstitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact\nsituation.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 20 (1965).\n                              V\n\n                              A\n\n  We next consider whether the material-support statute,\nas applied to plaintiffs, violates the freedom of speech\nguaranteed by the First Amendment. Both plaintiffs and\nthe Government take extreme positions on this question.\nPlaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their “pure\npolitical speech.” E.g., Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43. It has\nnot. Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may\nsay anything they wish on any topic. They may speak and\nwrite freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of\nTurkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international\nlaw. They may advocate before the United Nations. As\nthe Government states: “The statute does not prohibit\nindependent advocacy or expression of any kind.” Brief for\nGovernment 13. Section 2339B also “does not prevent\n[plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nor impose any sanction on them for doing so.” Id., at 60.\nCongress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or\nopinions in the form of “pure political speech.” Rather,\nCongress has prohibited “material support,” which most\noften does not take the form of speech at all. And when it\ndoes, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow\ncategory of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordi­\nnation with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be\nterrorist organizations.4\n   For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far,\nclaiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation\nis conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is directed at the\nfact of plaintiffs’ interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the\nGovernment contends, and only incidentally burdens their\nexpression. The Government argues that the proper\nstandard of review is therefore the one set out in United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). In that case, the\nCourt rejected a First Amendment challenge to a convic­\ntion under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying\ndraft cards, even though O’Brien had burned his card in\nprotest against the draft. See id., at 370, 376, 382. In so\ndoing, we applied what we have since called “intermediate\nscrutiny,” under which a “content-neutral regulation will\nbe sustained under the First Amendment if it advances\nimportant governmental interests unrelated to the sup­\npression of free speech and does not burden substantially\nmore speech than necessary to further those interests.”\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180,\n189 (1997) (citing O’Brien, supra, at 377).\n   The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at\n——————\n  4 The dissent also analyzes the statute as if it prohibited “[p]eaceful\n\npolitical advocacy” or “pure speech and association,” without more.\nPost, at 9, 17. Section 2339B does not do that, and we do not address\nthe constitutionality of any such prohibitions. The dissent’s claim that\nour decision is inconsistent with this Court’s cases analyzing those\nsorts of restrictions, post, at 11–12, is accordingly unfounded.\n22         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nissue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to\nargue that O’Brien provides the correct standard of re­\nview.5 O’Brien does not provide the applicable standard\nfor reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 385–386 (1992); Texas\nv. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403, 406–407 (1989), and\n§2339B regulates speech on the basis of its content. Plain­\ntiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether\nthey may do so under §2339B depends on what they say.\nIf plaintiffs’ speech to those groups imparts a “specific\nskill” or communicates advice derived from “specialized\nknowledge”—for example, training on the use of interna­\ntional law or advice on petitioning the United Nations—\nthen it is barred. See Brief for Government 33–34. On the\nother hand, plaintiffs’ speech is not barred if it imparts\nonly general or unspecialized knowledge. See id., at 32.\n   The Government argues that §2339B should nonethe­\nless receive intermediate scrutiny because it generally\nfunctions as a regulation of conduct. That argument runs\nheadlong into a number of our precedents, most promi­\nnently Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). Cohen\nalso involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct,\nbarring breaches of the peace. See id., at 16. But when\nCohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an\nepithet, we did not apply O’Brien. See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.\nInstead, we recognized that the generally applicable law\n——————\n  5 The  Government suggests in passing that, to the extent plaintiffs’\nactivities constitute speech, that speech is wholly unprotected by the\nFirst Amendment. The Government briefly analogizes speech coordi­\nnated with foreign terrorist organizations to speech effecting a crime,\nlike the words that constitute a conspiracy. Brief for Government 46;\nReply Brief for Government 31–32, and n. 8. See, e.g., Giboney v.\nEmpire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, 502 (1949). We do not\nconsider any such argument because the Government does not develop\nit: The Government’s submission is that applying §2339B to plaintiffs\ntriggers intermediate First Amendment scrutiny—not that it triggers\nno First Amendment scrutiny at all.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas directed at Cohen because of what his speech commu­\nnicated—he violated the breach of the peace statute be­\ncause of the offensive content of his particular message.\nWe accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and re­\nversed his conviction. See id., at 18–19, 26.\n   This suit falls into the same category. The law here\nmay be described as directed at conduct, as the law in\nCohen was directed at breaches of the peace, but as ap­\nplied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under\nthe statute consists of communicating a message. As we\nexplained in Texas v. Johnson: “If the [Government’s]\nregulation is not related to expression, then the less strin­\ngent standard we announced in United States v. O’Brien\nfor regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If\nit is, then we are outside of O’Brien’s test, and we must\n[apply] a more demanding standard.” 491 U. S., at 403\n(citation omitted).\n                              B\n   The First Amendment issue before us is more refined\nthan either plaintiffs or the Government would have it. It\nis not whether the Government may prohibit pure political\nspeech, or may prohibit material support in the form of\nconduct. It is instead whether the Government may pro­\nhibit what plaintiffs want to do—provide material support\nto the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.\n   Everyone agrees that the Government’s interest in\ncombating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest\norder. See Brief for Plaintiffs 51. Plaintiffs’ complaint is\nthat the ban on material support, applied to what they\nwish to do, is not “necessary to further that interest.”\nIbid. The objective of combating terrorism does not justify\nprohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their\nsupport will advance only the legitimate activities of the\ndesignated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.\nId., at 51–52.\n24        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully\nsegregate support of their legitimate activities from sup­\nport of terrorism is an empirical question. When it en­\nacted §2339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings\nregarding the serious threat posed by international terror­\nism. See AEDPA §§301(a)(1)–(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note\nfollowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). One\nof those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs’ contention\nthat their support would not further the terrorist activities\nof the PKK and LTTE: “[F]oreign organizations that en­\ngage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal\nconduct that any contribution to such an organization\nfacilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7) (emphasis added).\n   Plaintiffs argue that the reference to “any contribution”\nin this finding meant only monetary support. There is no\nreason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly\nbecause Congress expressly prohibited so much more than\nmonetary support in §2339B. Congress’s use of the term\n“contribution” is best read to reflect a determination that\nany form of material support furnished “to” a foreign\nterrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely\nwhat the material-support statute does. Indeed, when\nCongress enacted §2339B, Congress simultaneously re­\nmoved an exception that had existed in §2339A(a) (1994\ned.) for the provision of material support in the form of\n“humanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved\nin” terrorist activity. AEDPA §323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205\nF. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful\naid would have no harmful effects.\n   We are convinced that Congress was justified in reject­\ning that view. The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.\n“The PKK’s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000\nlives.” Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 128, ¶5.\nThe LTTE has engaged in extensive suicide bombings and\npolitical assassinations, including killings of the Sri\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 130–132; Brief for Government 6–7. “On\nJanuary 31, 1996, the LTTE exploded a truck bomb filled\nwith an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at the Cen­\ntral Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring\nmore than 1,400. This bombing was the most deadly\nterrorist incident in the world in 1996.” McKune Affida­\nvit, App. 131, ¶6.h. It is not difficult to conclude as Con­\ngress did that the “tain[t]” of such violent activities is so\ngreat that working in coordination with or at the com­\nmand of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and\nfurther their terrorist means. AEDPA §301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247.\n   Material support meant to “promot[e] peaceable, lawful\nconduct,” Brief for Plaintiffs 51, can further terrorism by\nforeign groups in multiple ways. “Material support” is a\nvaluable resource by definition. Such support frees up\nother resources within the organization that may be put to\nviolent ends. It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to\nforeign terrorist groups—legitimacy that makes it easier\nfor those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to\nraise funds—all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.\n“Terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational\n‘firewalls’ that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and\ncommingling of support and benefits.” McKune Affidavit,\nApp. 135, ¶11. “[I]nvestigators have revealed how terror­\nist groups systematically conceal their activities behind\ncharitable, social, and political fronts.” M.

There is\nevidence that the PKK and the LTTE, in particular, have\nnot “respected the line between humanitarian and violent\nactivities.” McKune Affidavit, App. 135, ¶13 (discussing\nPKK); see id., at 134 (LTTE).\n   The dissent argues that there is “no natural stopping\nplace” for the proposition that aiding a foreign terrorist\norganization’s lawful activity promotes the terrorist or­\nganization as a whole. Post, at 10. But Congress has\nsettled on just such a natural stopping place: The statute\nreaches only material support coordinated with or under\nthe direction of a designated foreign terrorist organization.\nIndependent advocacy that might be viewed as promoting\nthe group’s legitimacy is not covered.

We see no reason to question Congress’s find­\ning that “international cooperation is required for an\neffective response to terrorism, as demonstrated by the\nnumerous multilateral conventions in force providing\nuniversal prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in\na variety of terrorist acts, including hostage taking, mur­\nder of an internationally protected person, and aircraft\npiracy and sabotage.” AEDPA §301(a)(5), 110 Stat. 1247,\nnote following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose).\nThe material-support statute furthers this international\neffort by prohibiting aid for foreign terrorist groups that\nharm the United States’ partners abroad: “A number of\ndesignated foreign terrorist organizations have attacked\nmoderate governments with which the United States has\nvigorously endeavored to maintain close and friendly\nrelations,” and those attacks “threaten [the] social, eco­\nnomic and political stability” of such governments.\nMcKune Affidavit, App. 137, ¶16. “[O]ther foreign terror­\nist organizations attack our NATO allies, thereby impli­\ncating important and sensitive multilateral security ar­\nrangements.” Ibid.\n   For example, the Republic of Turkey—a fellow member\nof NATO—is defending itself against a violent insurgency\n——————\n  6 The dissent also contends that the particular sort of material sup­\nport plaintiffs seek to provide cannot be diverted to terrorist activities,\nin the same direct way as funds or goods. Post, at 8–9. This contention\nmisses the point. Both common sense and the evidence submitted by\nthe Government make clear that material support of a terrorist group’s\nlawful activities facilitates the group’s ability to attract “funds,” “fi­\nnancing,” and “goods” that will further its terrorist acts. See McKune\nAffidavit, App. 134–136.\n28        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwaged by the PKK. Brief for Government 6; App. 128.\nThat nation and our other allies would react sharply to\nAmericans furnishing material support to foreign groups\nlike the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the expla­\nnation that the support was meant only to further those\ngroups’ “legitimate” activities. From Turkey’s perspective,\nthere likely are no such activities. See 352 F. 3d, at 389\n(observing that Turkey prohibits membership in the PKK\nand prosecutes those who provide support to that group,\nregardless of whether the support is directed to lawful\nactivities).\n                              C\n  In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distin­\nguish material support for a foreign terrorist group’s\nviolent activities and its nonviolent activities, we do not\nrely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the\nrecord evidence. We have before us an affidavit stating\nthe Executive Branch’s conclusion on that question. The\nState Department informs us that “[t]he experience and\nanalysis of the U. S. government agencies charged with\ncombating terrorism strongly suppor[t]” Congress’s finding\nthat all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations\nfurther their terrorism.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14–15) (looking to similar\naffidavits to support according weight to national security\nclaims). In the Executive’s view: “Given the purposes,\norganizational structure, and clandestine nature of foreign\nterrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any mate­\nrial support to these organizations will ultimately inure to\nthe benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions—\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly in­\ntended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities.”\nMcKune Affidavit, App. 133, ¶8.\n  That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Con­\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This litigation\nimplicates sensitive and weighty interests of national\nsecurity and foreign affairs. The PKK and the LTTE have\ncommitted terrorist acts against American citizens abroad,\nand the material-support statute addresses acute foreign\npolicy concerns involving relationships with our Nation’s\nallies. See id., at 128–133, 137. We have noted that “nei­\nther the Members of this Court nor most federal judges\nbegin the day with briefings that may describe new and\nserious threats to our Nation and its people.” Boumediene\nv. Bush, 553 U. S. 723, 797 (2008). It is vital in this con­\ntext “not to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence\nfor a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.”\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 68 (1981). See Wald,\n468 U. S., at 242; Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 292 (1981).\n   Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns\nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant\nabdication of the judicial role. We do not defer to the\nGovernment’s reading of the First Amendment, even when\nsuch interests are at stake. We are one with the dissent\nthat the Government’s “authority and expertise in these\nmatters do not automatically trump the Court’s own obli­\ngation to secure the protection that the Constitution\ngrants to individuals.” Post, at 23. But when it comes to\ncollecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this\narea, “the lack of competence on the part of the courts is\nmarked,” Rostker, supra, at 65, and respect for the Gov­\nernment’s conclusions is appropriate.\n   One reason for that respect is that national security and\nforeign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to\nconfront evolving threats in an area where information\ncan be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct\ndifficult to assess. The dissent slights these real con­\nstraints in demanding hard proof—with “detail,” “specific\nfacts,” and “specific evidence”—that plaintiffs’ proposed\nactivities will support terrorist attacks. See post, at 9, 16,\n30        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23. That would be a dangerous requirement. In this\ncontext, conclusions must often be based on informed\njudgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality\naffects what we may reasonably insist on from the Gov­\nernment. The material-support statute is, on its face, a\npreventive measure—it criminalizes not terrorist attacks\nthemselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to\noccur. The Government, when seeking to prevent immi­\nnent harms in the context of international affairs and\nnational security, is not required to conclusively link all\nthe pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its\nempirical conclusions. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S., at 17\n(“[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of\ncontemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . .\nmust of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it\ncustomarily wields in domestic areas”).\n   This context is different from that in decisions like\nCohen. In that case, the application of the statute turned\non the offensiveness of the speech at issue. Observing that\n“one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,” we invalidated\nCohen’s conviction in part because we concluded that\n“governmental officials cannot make principled distinc­\ntions in this area.” 403 U. S., at 25. In this litigation, by\ncontrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely posi­\ntioned to make principled distinctions between activities\nthat will further terrorist conduct and undermine United\nStates foreign policy, and those that will not.\n   We also find it significant that Congress has been con­\nscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions\nmay implicate constitutional concerns. First, §2339B only\napplies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nThere is, and always has been, a limited number of those\norganizations designated by the Executive Branch, see,\ne.g., 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997),\nand any groups so designated may seek judicial review of\nthe designation. Second, in response to the lower courts’\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nholdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the\nstatute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms\n“training,” “personnel,” and “expert advice or assistance,”\nas well as an explanation of the knowledge required to\nviolate §2339B. Third, in effectuating its stated intent not\nto abridge First Amendment rights, see §2339B(i), Con­\ngress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in\ncreating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.\nThe definition of material support, for example, excludes\nmedicine and religious materials. See §2339A(b)(1). In\nthis area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature’s\nsuperior capacity for weighing competing interests means\nthat “we must be particularly careful not to substitute our\njudgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.” Rost\nker, supra, at 68. Finally, and most importantly, Congress\nhas avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or\nindeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or\ncontrolled by foreign terrorist groups.\n  At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the consid­\nered judgment of Congress and the Executive that provid­\ning material support to a designated foreign terrorist\norganization—even seemingly benign support—bolsters\nthe terrorist activities of that organization. That judg­\nment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we\nhave persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given\nthe sensitive interests in national security and foreign\naffairs at stake, the political branches have adequately\nsubstantiated their determination that, to serve the Gov­\nernment’s interest in preventing terrorism, it was neces­\nsary to prohibit providing material support in the form of\ntraining, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign\nterrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote\nonly the groups’ nonviolent ends.\n  We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to\nundertake. First, plaintiffs propose to “train members of\n[the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international\n32        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw to peacefully resolve disputes.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1.\nCongress can, consistent with the First Amendment,\nprohibit this direct training. It is wholly foreseeable that\nthe PKK could use the “specific skill[s]” that plaintiffs\npropose to impart, §2339A(b)(2), as part of a broader\nstrategy to promote terrorism. The PKK could, for exam­\nple, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time\nto recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into\ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed at­\ntacks. See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The\nPKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286–295\n(2007) (describing the PKK’s suspension of armed struggle\nand subsequent return to violence). A foreign terrorist\norganization introduced to the structures of the interna­\ntional legal system might use the information to threaten,\nmanipulate, and disrupt. This possibility is real, not\nremote.\n   Second, plaintiffs propose to “teach PKK members how\nto petition various representative bodies such as the\nUnited Nations for relief.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. The\nGovernment acts within First Amendment strictures in\nbanning this proposed speech because it teaches the or­\nganization how to acquire “relief,” which plaintiffs never\ndefine with any specificity, and which could readily in­\nclude monetary aid. See Brief for Plaintiffs 10–11, 16–17,\nn. 10; App. 58–59, 80–81. Indeed, earlier in this litigation,\nplaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE “to present claims for\ntsunami-related aid to mediators and international bod­\nies,” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1, which naturally included\nmonetary relief. Money is fungible, supra, at 26, and\nCongress logically concluded that money a terrorist group\nsuch as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs\npropose to teach could be redirected to funding the group’s\nviolent activities.\n   Finally, plaintiffs propose to “engage in political advo­\ncacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,” and “engage\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            33\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri\nLanka.” 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1. As explained above, su\npra, at 19–20, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level\nof coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what\nexactly their “advocacy” would consist of. Plaintiffs’ pro­\nposals are phrased at such a high level of generality that\nthey cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge. See\nsupra, at 20; Grange, 552 U. S., at 454; Zemel, 381 U. S.,\nat 20.\n   In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to ad­\ndress the real dangers at stake. It instead considers only\nthe possible benefits of plaintiffs’ proposed activities in the\nabstract. See post, at 13–15. The dissent seems unwilling\nto entertain the prospect that training and advising a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization on how to take\nadvantage of international entities might benefit that\norganization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activi­\nties. In the dissent’s world, such training is all to the\ngood. Congress and the Executive, however, have con­\ncluded that we live in a different world: one in which the\ndesignated foreign terrorist organizations “are so tainted\nby their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.” AEDPA §301(a)(7).\nOne in which, for example, “the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish\nrefugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come\nunder the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to\nrespect its ‘neutral and humanitarian nature.’ ” McKune\nAffidavit, App. 135–136, ¶13. Training and advice on how\nto work with the United Nations could readily have helped\nthe PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a\nbase for terrorist activities.\n   If only good can come from training our adversaries in\ninternational dispute resolution, presumably it would\nhave been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens\nfrom training the Japanese Government on using interna­\n34        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes\nduring World War II. It would, under the dissent’s rea­\nsoning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving\ndisputes through “ ‘deliberative forces,’ ” post, at 13 (quot­\ning Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that\nassisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort\nmore generally. That view is not one the First Amend­\nment requires us to embrace.\n   All this is not to say that any future applications of the\nmaterial-support statute to speech or advocacy will sur­\nvive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to say that\nany other statute relating to speech and terrorism would\nsatisfy the First Amendment. In particular, we in no way\nsuggest that a regulation of independent speech would\npass constitutional muster, even if the Government were\nto show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organi­\nzations. We also do not suggest that Congress could ex­\ntend the same prohibition on material support at issue\nhere to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in\nprohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs\nseek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, §2339B does\nnot violate the freedom of speech.\n                              VI\n  Plaintiffs’ final claim is that the material-support stat­\nute violates their freedom of association under the First\nAmendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminal­\nizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and\nthe LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like De\nJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937), and cases in which\nwe have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist\nParty, see, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\nState of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); United States v. Robel,\n389 U. S. 258 (1967).\n  The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim be­\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause the statute does not penalize mere association with\na foreign terrorist organization. As the Ninth Circuit put\nit: “The statute does not prohibit being a member of one of\nthe designated groups or vigorously promoting and sup­\nporting the political goals of the group. . . . What [§2339B]\nprohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .” 205\nF. 3d, at 1133. Plaintiffs want to do the latter. Our deci­\nsions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or as­\nsembly are therefore inapposite. See, e.g., Robel, supra, at\n262 (“It is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indis­\ncriminately across all types of association with Commu­\nnist-action groups, without regard to the quality and\ndegree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First\nAmendment”); De Jonge, supra, at 362.\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute\nburdens their freedom of association because it prevents\nthem from providing support to designated foreign terror­\nist organizations, but not to other groups. See Brief for\nPlaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37–38. Any burden\non plaintiffs’ freedom of association in this regard is justi­\nfied for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs’\nfree speech challenge. It would be strange if the Constitu­\ntion permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of\nspeech that constitute material support, but did not per­\nmit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly\ndangerous and lawless foreign organizations. Congress is\nnot required to ban material support to every group or\nnone at all.\n                        *   *    *\n  The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the\npeople of the United States ordained and established that\ncharter of government in part to “provide for the common\ndefence.” As Madison explained, “[s]ecurity against for­\neign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the\nAmerican Union.” The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J. Cooke\n36        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ned. 1961). We hold that, in regulating the particular forms\nof support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terror­\nist organizations, Congress has pursued that objective\nconsistent with the limitations of the First and Fifth\nAmendments.\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con­\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion\nthat the Constitution permits the Government to prose\ncute the plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated\nteaching and advocacy furthering the designated organiza\ntions’ lawful political objectives. In my view, the Govern\nment has not met its burden of showing that an interpre\ntation of the statute that would prohibit this speech- and\nassociation-related activity serves the Government’s com\npelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would\ninterpret the statute as normally placing activity of this\nkind outside its scope. See Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22, 62 (1932); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

S. C. §§2339B(a)(1), (g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). The\nSecretary of State has designated the Kurdistan Workers’\nParty (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n(LTTE) as “foreign terrorist organizations”—a designation\nauthorized where the organization is “foreign,” threatens\nthe security of the United States or its nationals, and\nengages in “terrorist activity,” defined to include “any” of\nsuch activities as “highjacking” and “assassination,” or the\n“use of . . . any . . . weapon or dangerous device . . . with\nintent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one\nor more individuals.” 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997); 8 U. S. C.\n§1182(a)(3)(B)(iii); 18 U. S.

Mukasey, 552\nF. 3d 916, 921, n. 1 (CA9 2009); ante, at 9. All these ac\ntivities are of a kind that the First Amendment ordinarily\nprotects.\n   In my view, the Government has not made the strong\nshowing necessary to justify under the First Amendment\nthe criminal prosecution of those who engage in these\nactivities. All the activities involve the communication\nand advocacy of political ideas and lawful means of achiev\ning political ends. Even the subjects the plaintiffs wish to\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

We cannot avoid the constitu\ntional significance of these facts on the basis that some of\nthis speech takes place outside the United States and is\ndirected at foreign governments, for the activities also\ninvolve advocacy in this country directed to our govern\nment and its policies. The plaintiffs, for example, wish to\nwrite and distribute publications and to speak before the\nUnited States Congress. App. 58–59.\n   That this speech and association for political purposes is\nthe kind of activity to which the First Amendment ordi\nnarily offers its strongest protection is elementary.

S. 254, 269 (1964)\n(The First Amendment “ ‘was fashioned to assure unfet\ntered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of politi\ncal and social changes desired by the people’ ” (quoting\nRoth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957)); Lovell v.\nCity of Griffin, 303 U.

That amendment, after all,\nalso protects the freedom of association. See NAACP v.\nClaiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 911 (1982) (The\nFirst Amendment’s protections “of speech, assembly,\nassociation, and petition, ‘though not identical, are insepa\nrable’ ” (quoting Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.

United States\nJaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622 (1984). “Coordination” with a\npolitical group, like membership, involves association.\n   “Coordination” with a group that engages in unlawful\nactivity also does not deprive the plaintiffs of the First\nAmendment’s protection under any traditional “categori\ncal” exception to its protection. The plaintiffs do not pro\npose to solicit a crime. They will not engage in fraud or\ndefamation or circulate obscenity. Cf. United States v.\nStevens, 559 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6) (de\nscribing “categories” of unprotected speech). And the First\nAmendment protects advocacy even of unlawful action so\nlong as that advocacy is not “directed to inciting or produc\ning imminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or\nproduce such action.” Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,\n447 (1969) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Here the plain\ntiffs seek to advocate peaceful, lawful action to secure\npolitical ends; and they seek to teach others how to do\nthe same. No one contends that the plaintiffs’ speech to\nthese organizations can be prohibited as incitement under\nBrandenburg.\n   Moreover, the Court has previously held that a person\nwho associates with a group that uses unlawful means to\nachieve its ends does not thereby necessarily forfeit the\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 203, 229 (1961)\n(“[Q]uasi-political parties or other groups that may em\nbrace both legal and illegal aims differ from a technical\nconspiracy, which is defined by its criminal purpose”); see\nalso NAACP, supra, at 908 (“The right to associate does\nnot lose all constitutional protection merely because some\nmembers of the group may have participated in conduct or\nadvocated doctrine that itself is not protected”). Rather,\nthe Court has pointed out in respect to associating with a\ngroup advocating overthrow of the Government through\nforce and violence: “If the persons assembling have com\nmitted crimes elsewhere . . . , they may be prosecuted for\ntheir . . . violation of valid laws. But it is a different mat\nter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such\noffenses, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable\nassembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a\ncriminal charge.” De Jonge, supra, at 365 (striking down\nconviction for attending and assisting at Communist Party\nmeeting because “[n]otwithstanding [the party’s] objec\ntives, the defendant still enjoyed his personal right of free\nspeech and to take part in peaceable assembly having a\nlawful purpose”).\n   Not even the “serious and deadly problem” of interna\ntional terrorism can require automatic forfeiture of First\nAmendment rights. §301(a)(1), 110 Stat. 1247, note fol\nlowing 18 U. S. C. §2339B. Cf. §2339B(i) (instructing\ncourts not to “constru[e] or appl[y the statute] so as to\nabridge the exercise of right guaranteed under the First\nAmendment”). After all, this Court has recognized that\nnot “ ‘[e]ven the war power . . . remove[s] constitutional\nlimitations safeguarding essential liberties.’ ”         United\nStates v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258, 264 (1967) (quoting Home\nBuilding & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 426\n(1934)). See also Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616,\n628 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“[A]s against dangers\n6         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npeculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the\nright to free speech is always the same”). Thus, there is\nno general First Amendment exception that applies here.\nIf the statute is constitutional in this context, it would\nhave to come with a strong justification attached.\n  It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the\nconstitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs’\nproposed activities, would apply, not the kind of interme\ndiate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct,\nbut “ ‘a more demanding standard.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 403 (1989)). Indeed,\nwhere, as here, a statute applies criminal penalties and at\nleast arguably does so on the basis of content-based dis\ntinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute\nand justifications “strictly”—to determine whether the\nprohibition is justified by a “compelling” need that cannot\nbe “less restrictively” accommodated. See Houston v. Hill,\n482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (criminal penalties); Ashcroft v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002)\n(content-based); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.\nY. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118 (1991)\n(same); Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 540 (1980) (strict scru\ntiny); First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n786 (1978) (same).\n  But, even if we assume for argument’s sake that “strict\nscrutiny” does not apply, no one can deny that we must at\nthe very least “measure the validity of the means adopted\nby Congress against both the goal it has sought to achieve\nand the specific prohibitions of the First Amendment.”\nRobel, supra, 268, n. 20 (describing constitutional task\nwhere the Court is faced “with a clear conflict between a\nfederal statute enacted in the interests of national security\nand an individual’s exercise of his First Amendment\nrights”). And here I need go no further, for I doubt that\nthe statute, as the Government would interpret it, can\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

S. 180, 189 (1997) (describing intermediate scru\ntiny). Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528\nU. S. 377, 402 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring) (examining\nwhether a statute worked speech-related harm “out of\nproportion to the statute’s salutary effects upon” other\ninterests).\n\n   The Government does identify a compelling countervail\ning interest, namely, the interest in protecting the security\nof the United States and its nationals from the threats\nthat foreign terrorist organizations pose by denying those\norganizations financial and other fungible resources. I do\nnot dispute the importance of this interest. But I do dis\npute whether the interest can justify the statute’s criminal\nprohibition. To put the matter more specifically, precisely\nhow does application of the statute to the protected activi\nties before us help achieve that important security-related\nend? See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 118 (requiring\nthat “narrowly drawn” means further a “compelling state\ninterest” by the least restrictive means (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); Turner, supra, at 189 (requiring “ad\nvance[ment of] important governmental interests unre\nlated to the suppression of free speech” without “bur\nden[ing] substantially more speech than necessary to\nfurther those interests”); Robel, supra, at 268, n. 20 (re\nquiring measurement of the “means adopted by Congress\nagainst . . . the [security] goal it has sought to achieve”).\nSee also Nixon, 528 U. S., at 402 (BREYER, J., concurring);\nFederal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,\n551 U. S. 449, 478 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (“A\ncourt . . . must ensure that [the interest justifying a stat\nutory restriction] supports each application of [the]\nstatute”).\n   The Government makes two efforts to answer this ques\n8         HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion. First, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ sup\nport for these organizations is “fungible” in the same sense\nas other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the\nplaintiffs’ support could, for example, free up other re\nsources, which the organization might put to terrorist\nends. Brief for Respondents in No. 09–89, pp. 54–56 (here\ninafter Government Brief).\n   The proposition that the two very different kinds of\n“support” are “fungible,” however, is not obviously true.\nThere is no obvious way in which undertaking advocacy\nfor political change through peaceful means or teaching\nthe PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Na\ntions for political change is fungible with other resources\nthat might be put to more sinister ends in the way that\ndonations of money, food, or computer training are fungi\nble. It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities\ncan themselves be redirected, or will free other resources\nthat can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we\nmust determine whether the Government has come for\nward with evidence to support its claim.\n   The Government has provided us with no empirical\ninformation that might convincingly support this claim.\nInstead, the Government cites only to evidence that Con\ngress was concerned about the “fungible” nature in general\nof resources, predominately money and material goods. It\npoints to a congressional finding that “foreign organiza\ntions that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by\ntheir criminal conduct that any contribution to such an\norganization facilitates that conduct.” §301(a)(7), 110\nStat. 1247, note following 18 U. S. C. §2339B (emphasis\nadded). It also points to a House Report’s statement that\n“supply[ing] funds, goods, or services” would “hel[p] defray\nthe cost to the terrorist organization of running the osten\nsibly legitimate activities,” and “in turn fre[e] an equal\nsum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.” H. R.\nRep. No. 104–383, p. 81 (1995) (emphasis added). Finally,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Government refers to a State Department official’s\naffidavit describing how ostensibly charitable contribu\ntions have either been “redirected” to terrorist ends or,\neven if spent charitably, have “unencumber[ed] funds\nraised from other sources for use in facilitating violent,\nterrorist activities and gaining political support for these\nactivities.” Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134,\n136 (emphasis added).\n   The most one can say in the Government’s favor about\nthese statements is that they might be read as offering\nhighly general support for its argument. The statements\ndo not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs’\npolitical-advocacy-related activities might actually be\n“fungible” and therefore capable of being diverted to ter\nrorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was\nconcerned with “support” of this kind. The affidavit refers\nto “funds,” “financing,” and “goods”—none of which en\ncompasses the plaintiffs’ activities. Ibid. The statutory\nstatement and the House Report use broad terms like\n“contributions” and “services” that might be construed as\nencompassing the plaintiffs’ activities. But in context,\nthose terms are more naturally understood as referring to\ncontributions of goods, money, or training and other ser\nvices (say, computer programming) that could be diverted\nto, or free funding for, terrorist ends. See infra, at 15–16.\nPeaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into\nthese categories. And the statute itself suggests that\nCongress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or\nassociation. See §2339B(i) (“Nothing in this section shall\nbe construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of\nrights guaranteed under the First Amendment”); see also\ninfra, at 18–19.\n   Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs’ pro\nposed activities will “bolste[r] a terrorist organization’s\nefficacy and strength in a community” and “undermin[e]\nthis nation’s efforts to delegitimize and weaken those\n10        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngroups.” Government Brief 56 (emphasis added). In the\nCourt’s view, too, the Constitution permits application of\nthe statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because\nthose activities could provide a group that engages in\nterrorism with “legitimacy.” Ante, at 25. The Court sug\ngests that, armed with this greater “legitimacy,” these\norganizations will more readily be able to obtain material\nsupport of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban—\nmoney, arms, lodging, and the like. See ibid.\n   Yet the Government does not claim that the statute\nforbids any speech “legitimating” a terrorist group.\nRather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership\nin terrorist organizations, (2) “peaceably assembling with\nmembers of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,” or\n(3) “independent advocacy” on behalf of these organiza\ntions. Government Brief 66, 61, 13. The Court, too, em\nphasizes that activities not “coordinated with” the terror\nist groups are not banned. See ante, at 21, 26, 31\n(emphasis added). And it argues that speaking, writing,\nand teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization’s\npeaceful political ends could “mak[e] it easier for those\ngroups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.”\nAnte, at 25.\n   But this “legitimacy” justification cannot by itself war\nrant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and asso\nciation. Speech, association, and related activities on\nbehalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to le\ngitimate that group. Thus, were the law to accept a “le\ngitimating” effect, in and of itself and without qualifica\ntion, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a\nban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold\ninstances where it should be won. Once one accepts this\nargument, there is no natural stopping place. The argu\nment applies as strongly to “independent” as to “coordi\nnated” advocacy. But see ante, at 26–27. That fact is\nreflected in part in the Government’s claim that the ban\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhere, so supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a desig\nnated group from filing on behalf of that group an amicus\nbrief before the United Nations or even before this Court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 47–49, 53.\n   That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a\nline designed to accept the legitimacy argument in some\ninstances but not in others. It is inordinately difficult to\ndistinguish when speech activity will and when it will not\ninitiate the chain of causation the Court suggests—a chain\nthat leads from peaceful advocacy to “legitimacy” to in\ncreased support for the group to an increased supply of\nmaterial goods that support its terrorist activities. Even\nwere we to find some such line of distinction, its applica\ntion would seem so inherently uncertain that it would\noften, perhaps always, “chill” protected speech beyond its\nboundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply\nin abstract terms and without limitation, must always, or\nit will never, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plain\ntiffs’ activities, “always” cannot possibly be the First\nAmendment’s answer.\n   Regardless, the “legitimacy” justification itself is incon\nsistent with critically important First Amendment case\nlaw. Consider the cases involving the protection the First\nAmendment offered those who joined the Communist\nParty intending only to further its peaceful activities. In\nthose cases, this Court took account of congressional find\nings that the Communist Party not only advocated theo\nretically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow\nof our Government through force and violence. The Court\nhad previously accepted Congress’ determinations that the\nAmerican Communist Party was a “Communist action\norganization” which (1) acted under the “control, direction,\nand discipline” of the world Communist movement, a\nmovement that sought to employ “espionage, sabotage,\nterrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to\nestablish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,” and (2)\n12        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“endeavor[ed]” to bring about “the overthrow of existing\ngovernments by . . . force if necessary.” Communist Party\nof United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 367\nU. S. 1, 5–6 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment\nprotected an American’s right to belong to that party—\ndespite whatever “legitimating” effect membership might\nhave had—as long as the person did not share the party’s\nunlawful purposes. See, e.g., De Jonge, 299 U. S. 353;\nScales, 367 U. S., at 228–230; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384\nU. S. 11, 17 (1966); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.\nof State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605–610 (1967); Robel, 389\nU. S. 258 (holding that national security interests did not\njustify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of\nCommunist-affiliated organizations working in any de\nfense-related facility). As I have pointed out, those cases\ndraw further support from other cases permitting pure\nadvocacy of even the most unlawful activity—as long as\nthat advocacy is not “directed to inciting or producing\nimminent lawless action and . . . likely to incite or produce\nsuch action.” Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447. The Gov\nernment’s “legitimating” theory would seem to apply to\nthese cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized,\nit would have led this Court to conclusions other than\nthose it reached.\n\n   Nor can the Government overcome these considerations\nsimply by narrowing the covered activities to those that\ninvolve coordinated, rather than independent, advocacy.\nConversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements\nmight well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related\nactivities here at issue (just as conversations and discus\nsions are a necessary part of membership in any organiza\ntion). The Government does not distinguish this kind of\n“coordination” from any other. I am not aware of any form\nof words that might be used to describe “coordination” that\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould not, at a minimum, seriously chill not only the kind\nof activities the plaintiffs raise before us, but also the\n“independent advocacy” the Government purports to per\nmit. And, as for the Government’s willingness to distin\nguish independent advocacy from coordinated advocacy,\nthe former is more likely, not less likely, to confer legiti\nmacy than the latter. Thus, other things being equal, the\ndistinction “coordination” makes is arbitrary in respect to\nfurthering the statute’s purposes. And a rule of law that\nfinds the “legitimacy” argument adequate in respect to the\nlatter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute\nthat sought to attack the former.\n   Consider the majority’s development of the Govern\nment’s themes. First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’\nproposal to “ ‘train members of [the] PKK on how to use\nhumanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve\ndisputes.’ ” Ante, at 31–32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1).\nThe majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in\nsignificant part on the ground that “peaceful negotia\ntion[s]” might just “bu[y] time . . . , lulling opponents into\ncomplacency.” Ante, at 32. And the PKK might use its\nnew information about “the structures of the international\nlegal system . . . to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.”\nIbid.\n   What is one to say about these arguments—arguments\nthat would deny First Amendment protection to the peace\nful teaching of international human rights law on the\nground that a little knowledge about “the international\nlegal system” is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent’s\nsubsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so\nlet’s not teach him how to try? What might be said of\nthese claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation com\nmitted to the resolution of disputes through “deliberative\nforces”? Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n   In my own view, the majority’s arguments stretch the\n14        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconcept of “fungibility” beyond constitutional limits.\nNeither Congress nor the Government advanced these\nparticular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case\nin this Court—not Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652\n(1925), not Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919),\nnot Abrams, 250 U. S. 616, not the later Communist Party\ncases decided during the heat of the Cold War—in which\nthe Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or\nteaching might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating\ntime for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.\n    Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put\notherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is\nomnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more\nthan (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this\nkind of argument without more and to apply it to the\nteaching of a subject such as international human rights\nlaw is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitu\ntion’s text and First Amendment precedent, would auto\nmatically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case\nwhere national security interests conflict with the First\nAmendment. The Constitution does not allow all such\nconflicts to be decided in the Government’s favor.\n    The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its\narguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain\nfree to engage in the protected activity as long as it is not\n“coordinated.” That is because there is no practical way to\norganize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about\nhuman rights law) without “coordination.” Nor can the\nmajority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to\nsome special limiting circumstance present here. That is\nbecause the only evidence the majority offers to support its\ngeneral claim consists of a single reference to a book about\nterrorism, which the Government did not mention, and\nwhich apparently says no more than that at one time the\nPKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to\nit.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Second, the majority discusses the plaintiffs’ proposal to\n“ ‘teach PKK members how to petition various representa\ntive bodies such as the United Nations for relief.’ ” Ante, at\n32 (quoting 552 F. 3d, at 921, n. 1; emphasis added). The\nmajority’s only argument with respect to this proposal is\nthat the relief obtained “could readily include monetary\naid,” which the PKK might use to buy guns. Ante, at 32.\nThe majority misunderstands the word “relief.” In this\ncontext, as the record makes clear, the word “relief” does\nnot refer to “money.” It refers to recognition under the\nGeneva Conventions. See App. 57–58 (2003 Complaint);\nid., at 79–80 (1998 Complaint); id., at 113 (Fertig Declara\ntion); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs’ counsel deny\ning that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in\nthe form of money).\n    Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would\ndefer strongly to Congress’ “informed judgment.” See, e.g.,\nante, at 30. But here, there is no evidence that Congress\nhas made such a judgment regarding the specific activities\nat issue in these cases. See infra, at 20–21. In any event,\n“whenever the fundamental rights of free speech and\nassembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain\nopen [for judicial determination] whether there actually\ndid exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if\nany, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended\nwas one so substantial as to justify the stringent restric\ntion interposed by the legislature.” Whitney, supra, at\n378–379 (Brandeis, J., concurring). In such circum\nstances, the “judicial function commands analysis of\nwhether the specific conduct charged falls within the\nreach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is\nconsonant with the Constitution.” Landmark Communi\ncations, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 844 (1978). Hence,\na legislative declaration “does not preclude enquiry into\nthe question whether, at the time and under the circum\nstances, the conditions existed which are essential to\n16        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvalidity under the Federal Constitution.” Whitney, supra,\nat 378; see also Landmark, supra, at 843 (“Deference to a\nlegislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First\nAmendment rights are at stake”).\n   I concede that the Government’s expertise in foreign\naffairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters,\ne.g., our relations with Turkey. Cf. ante, at 27–28. But it\nremains for this Court to decide whether the Government\nhas shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing\nspeech activity otherwise protected by the First Amend\nment. And the fact that other nations may like us less for\ngranting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the\nday.\n   Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Govern\nment nor the majority points to any specific facts that\nshow that the speech-related activities before us are fun\ngible in some special way or confer some special legitimacy\nupon the PKK. Rather, their arguments in this respect\nare general and speculative. Those arguments would\napply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual\npurpose group’s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether\nthe speech-related activity is coordinated). Both First\nAmendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent\nus from “sacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so\nspeculative a gain.” Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.\nv. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 127\n(1973); see also Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U. S., at 543\n(rejecting proffered state interest not supported in record\nbecause “[m]ere speculation of harm does not constitute a\ncompelling state interest”).\n                            II\n  For the reasons I have set forth, I believe application of\nthe statute as the Government interprets it would gravely\nand without adequate justification injure interests of the\nkind the First Amendment protects. Thus, there is “a\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nserious doubt” as to the statute’s constitutionality. Cro\nwell, 285 U. S., at 62. And where that is so, we must\n“ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly\npossible by which the question may be avoided.” Ibid.; see\nalso Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 689 (2001);\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78\n(1994); United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, 401\n(1916).\n  I believe that a construction that would avoid the consti\ntutional problem is “fairly possible.” In particular, I would\nread the statute as criminalizing First-Amendment\nprotected pure speech and association only when the\ndefendant knows or intends that those activities will assist\nthe organization’s unlawful terrorist actions. Under this\nreading, the Government would have to show, at a mini\nmum, that such defendants provided support that they\nknew was significantly likely to help the organization\npursue its unlawful terrorist aims.\n  A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is\naware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likeli\nhood that his or her conduct will materially support the\norganization’s terrorist ends. See Allen v. United States,\n164 U. S. 492, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code\n§2.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962). See also United States v. Santos, 553\nU. S. 507, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal\nCode §2.02(7) (willful blindness); S. Rep. No. 95–605, pt. 1,\npp. 59–60 (1977). A person also acts with the requisite\nintent if it is his “conscious objective” (or purpose) to fur\nther those same terrorist ends. See United States v. Bai\nley, 444 U. S. 394, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code\n§§2.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (“When acting knowingly suffices\nto establish an element, such element also is established if\na person acts purposely”). On the other hand, for the\nreasons I have set out, see supra, at 9–12, knowledge or\nintent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities)\n18        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncould or would help further terrorism simply by helping to\nlegitimate the organization is not sufficient.\n   This reading of the statute protects those who engage in\npure speech and association ordinarily protected by the\nFirst Amendment. But it does not protect that activity\nwhere a defendant purposefully intends it to help terror\nism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds him\nself to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to\nassist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these catego\nries of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist\nends, the act of providing material support to a known\nterrorist organization bears a close enough relation to\nterrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited\nnotwithstanding any First Amendment interest.              Cf.\nBrandenburg, 395 U. S. 444. At the same time, this read\ning does not require the Government to undertake the\ndifficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and\nnonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred;\nknowledge is enough. See Bailey, supra, at 405 (defining\nspecific intent).\n   This reading is consistent with the statute’s text. The\nstatute prohibits “knowingly provid[ing] material support\nor resources to a foreign terrorist organization.”\n§2339B(a)(1) (emphasis added). Normally we read a crimi\nnal statute as applying a mens rea requirement to all of\nthe subsequently listed elements of the crime. See Flores-\nFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6–7). So read, the defendant would have to know or\nintend (1) that he is providing support or resources, (2)\nthat he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist\norganization, and (3) that he is providing support that is\nmaterial, meaning (4) that his support bears a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist ends.\n   This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute’s\nuse of the word “material.” That word can mean being of a\nphysical or worldly nature, but it also can mean “being of\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreal importance or great consequence.” Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1392 (1961). Here, it must\nmean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to\nphysical aid, would not apply to speech at all. See also\n§2339A(b)(1) (defining “ ‘material support or resources’ ” as\n“any property, tangible or intangible” (emphasis added)).\nAnd if the statute applies only to support that would likely\nbe of real importance or great consequence, it must have\nimportance or consequence in respect to the organization’s\nterrorist activities. That is because support that is not\nsignificantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes\nof this statute, neither has “importance” nor is of “great\nconsequence.”\n   The statutory definition of “material support” poses no\nproblem. The statute defines “material support” through\nreference to a list of terms, including those at issue here—\n“training,” “expert advice or assistance,” “personnel,” and\n“service.” §2339B(g)(4); §2339A(b)(1). Since these latter\nterms all fall under the definition of the term “material\nsupport,” these activities fall within the statute’s scope\nonly when they too are “material.” Cf. Stevens, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S.\n1, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from\nthe term to be defined)).\n   Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that\nthe defendant knew the support was material can be read\nto require the Government to show that the defendant\nknew that the consequences of his acts had a significant\nlikelihood of furthering the organization’s terrorist, not\njust its lawful, aims.\n   I need not decide whether this is the only possible read\ning of the statute in cases where “material support” takes\nthe form of “currency,” “property,” “monetary instru\nments,” “financial securities,” “financial services,” “lodg\ning,” “safehouses,” “false documentation or identification,”\n“weapons,” “lethal substances,” or “explosives,” and the\n20        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlike. §2339A(b)(1). Those kinds of aid are inherently more\nlikely to help an organization’s terrorist activities, either\ndirectly or because they are fungible in nature. Thus, to\nshow that an individual has provided support of those\nkinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assum\ning the statute’s other requirements are met). But where\nsupport consists of pure speech or association, I would\nindulge in no such presumption. Rather, the Government\nwould have to prove that the defendant knew he was\nproviding support significantly likely to help the organiza\ntion pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively,\nthat the defendant intended the support to be so used).\n   The statute’s history strongly supports this reading.\nThat history makes clear that Congress primarily sought\nto end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations\nof money or goods. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 104–383, at\n38, 43–45, 81; supra, at 8–9. It shows that Congress,\nwhen referring to “expert services and assistance” for\nexample, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungi\nble to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation ex\npert’s giving “advice” that “facilitat[es] an aircraft hijack\ning” or an accountant’s giving “advice” that will “facilitate\nthe concealment of funds used to support terrorist activi\nties.” Hearing on Administration’s Draft Anti-Terrorism\nAct of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).\n   And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Commit\ntee, told the Senate:\n     “This bill also includes provisions making it a crime to\n     knowingly provide material support to the terrorist\n     functions of foreign groups designated by a Presiden\n     tial finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.” 142\n     Cong. Rec. S3354 (1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch)\n     (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nHe then added:\n    “I am convinced we have crafted a narrow but effec\n    tive designation provision which meets these obliga\n    tions while safeguarding the freedom to associate,\n    which none of us would willingly give up.” Id., at\n    S3360.\nConsistent with this view, the statute itself says:\n    “Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied\n    so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed un\n    der the First Amendment to the Constitution of the\n    United States.” §2339B(i).\n   In any event, the principle of constitutional avoidance\ndemands this interpretation. As Part II makes clear,\nthere is a “serious” doubt—indeed, a “grave” doubt—about\nthe constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to\ncriminalize the activities before us. Crowell, 285 U. S., at\n62; see also Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346–348 (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring); Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S., at 401. We there\nfore must “read the statute to eliminate” that constitu\ntional “doub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly\ncontrary to the intent of Congress.” X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U. S., at 78.\n   For this reason, the majority’s statutory claim that\nCongress did not use the word “knowingly” as I would use\nit, ante, at 12–13, and n. 3, is beside the point. Our conse\nquent reading is consistent with the statute’s text; it is\nconsistent with Congress’ basic intent; it interprets but\ndoes not significantly add to what the statute otherwise\ncontains. Cf. e.g., United States v. Thirty-seven Photo\ngraphs, 402 U. S. 363, 373–374 (1971) (constitutionally\ncompelled to add requirement that “forfeiture proceedings\nbe commenced within 14 days and completed within 60\ndays” despite absence of any statutory time limits); NLRB\nv. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 507 (1979)\n22        HOLDER v. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(constitutionally compelled to interpret “employer” as\nimplicitly excluding “church-operated schools” despite\nsilence and eight other different but explicit exceptions).\nWe should adopt it.\n                              III\n   Having interpreted the statute to impose the mens rea\nrequirement just described, I would remand the cases so\nthat the lower courts could consider more specifically the\nprecise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to en\ngage and determine whether and to what extent a grant of\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. I do not\nsee why the majority does not also remand the cases for\nconsideration of the plaintiffs’ activities relating to “advo\ncating” for the organizations’ peaceful causes. See ante, at\n19–20, 32–33.\n   The majority does not remand, apparently because it\nbelieves the plaintiffs lose automatically in that these\n“advocacy” claims are too general. It adds that the plain\ntiffs did not “suggest what exactly their ‘advocacy’ would\nconsist of.” Ante, at 33. But the majority is wrong about\nthe lack of specificity. The record contains complaints and\naffidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy\nthese groups have previously engaged in and in which\nthey would like to continue to engage. See App. 56–63,\n78–87, 95–99, 110–123.\n   Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Govern\nment’s argument that the plaintiffs’ speech-related activi\nties amount to “conduct” and should be reviewed as such.\nGovernment Brief 44–57. Hence, I should think the ma\njority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect\nof the cases, applying a proper standard of review. See,\ne.g., Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U. S. 346, 357–\n358 (2007); Johnson v. California 543 U. S. 499, 515\n(2005); cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 25) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“When this Court\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware\nand must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to\nthe Executive and Legislative Branches the power to\nprovide for the national defense, and that it grants par\nticular authority to the President in matters of foreign\naffairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that\nauthority and expertise in these matters do not automati\ncally trump the Court’s own obligation to secure the pro\ntection that the Constitution grants to individuals. Cf.\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (“We have\nlong since made clear that a state of war is not a blank\ncheck . . . when it comes to the rights of th[is] Nation’s\ncitizens”). In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I\nbelieve the Court has failed to examine the Government’s\njustifications with sufficient care. It has failed to insist\nupon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It\nhas failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling\nends. And ultimately it deprives the individuals before us\nof the protection that the First Amendment demands.\n   That is why, with respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/149008/", "sha1": "afd26ec19730bad32f8b83612db469e93650d3b1", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-077", "time_retrieved": "2010-06-21T11:26:58"}
