A penalty is a means of punishment; interest a means of compensation. Bouvier defines it to be 'a consideration paid for the use of money or forbearance in demanding it when due.' This court has declined to give it peremptory definition, and construing statutes considered that it could 'safely decline either to limit' the word 'debts' to 'existing dues, or to extend its meaning so as to embrace all dues of whatever origin and description.' Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 79, 19 L. Ed. 101. See, also, New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483, 493, 27 S. Ct. 137, 51 L. Ed. 284.

Five per centum penalty is the cost of delinquency, and interest upon the amount due at 1 per cent. per month&#8212;12 per cent. a year. There is no ambiguity in the declaration nor the distinction made. Against their clearness and completeness section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act is cited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government yields as to the 5 per cent. penalty. It resists as to the 1 per cent. interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the 1 per cent. was involved, as well as being in effect penalty and not saved by its name, though it was imposed by the Legislature and within the legislative power, and notwithstanding that taxes are treated as debts within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. In re Sherwoods, 210 F. 754, 758, 127 C. C. A. 304, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 940; Kaw Boiler Works v. Schull, 230 F. 587, 144 C. C. A. 641, L. R.

The court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'On the point at bar [1 per cent. interest as the price of      the delay being penalty] we are in accord with In re Ashland,      etc. (D.

Besides, the federal statute is precise, and it is made peremptory by the distinction between 'penalty' and 'interest,' and if it may be conceded that the use of the latter word would not save it from condemnation if it were in effect the former, it cannot be conceded that 1 per cent. per month&#8212;12 per cent. a year&#8212;gives it that illegal effect, certainly not against legislative declaration that is within the legislative power, there being no ambiguity to resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this conclusion New York v.

Laws, c. 60) was passed on which required 'every domestic corporation' to 'annually pay in advance * * * an annual franchise tax' upon its net income for the year next preceding, and provided that, if the tax were not paid, the corporation should pay 'in addition to the amount of such tax * * * ten per centum of such amount, plus one per centum for each month the tax * * * remains unpaid.' This liability the lower federal courts pronounced a penalty and not to be allowed. In that conclusion this court concurred and decided that, being penalty, it was disallowed by Bankruptcy Act, &#167; 57j. And this not only because the 1 per centum was 'more than the value of the use of the money,' but because it was added by the statute to the 10 per cent. to make a single sum, and 'must be treated as part of one corpus, and must fall with that.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax in this case is one on income; a Interest is put upon it and so denominated, Interest is put upon it and so denominated, distinguished from the 5 per cent. as pen alty, clearly intended to compensate the delay in payment of the tax&#8212;the detriment of its nonpayment, to be continued during the time of its nonpayment&#8212;compensation, not punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>266 U.S. 304 (1924)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nCHILDS, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF J.
