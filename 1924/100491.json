The opinion there controls this cause unless the injuries sustained by appellant were not the result of tort, committed and effective, on navigable waters. In The R. W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 33, 24 S. Ct. 8, 48 L. Ed. 73, this court held that repairs to a vessel while in an ordinary dry dock were not made on land. The Jefferson, 215 U. S. 130, 30 S. Ct. 54, 54 L. Ed. 125, 17 Ann. Cas. 907. Here repairs were made upon the ship while supported by a structure floating on navigable waters. Clearly, the accident did not occur upon land. The doctrine followed in Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Company, 119 U. S. 625, 627, 7 S. Ct. 336, 337 (30 L. Ed. 501) that 'no structure that is not a ship or vessel is a subject of salvage,' has no application.
