Cronkhite, on October 25, 1918, 'within and on lands theretofore acquired for the exclusive use of the United States, and under the exclusive jurisdiction thereof, and within the Southern division of the Western district of Washington, to wit, within and on the Camp Lawis Military Reservation.' Pothier was arrested in the state of Rhode Island and, after hearings before the commissioner and the District Court, a warrant for his removal was directed as provided by section 1014, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St. &#167; 1674). By this habeas corpus proceeding the validity of the warrant is questioned and respondent's release sought. His contention is that the United States had not acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the place of the crime as alleged by the indictment, because they had not then received a deed to the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court said and held (In re Pothier, 285 Fed. 632):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The argument of the defense is that by the terms of the      statute the passing of the deed is a prerequisite to the      exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and that, as the      deed postdates the time of the alleged murder, the United      States did not than have exclusive jurisdiction over the      lands conveyed by said deed. But the evidence shows also that      before the passage of the deeds, and before the date of the      alleged murder, Pierce county, acting as the arm and agent of      the state, had acquired by condemnation, and had turned over      to the United States military authorities, many tracts of      land comprised within the Camp Lewis Military Reservation,      which had been selected by a representative of the Secretary      of War, and which, when donated to the United States, the      Secretary of War had been authorized to accept. Buildings had      been erected and the camp permanently occupied before January      29, 1918, and before July, 1918, there were 50,000 men in      camp. There is much evidence tending to show that as to a      number of the tracts of land comprised in the camp there was,      before the date of the alleged crime, a practical      consummation of the donation, and that the agents of the      county and of the United States had done all that it was      necessary to do in order to vest title and exclusive      jurisdiction in the United States, save the execution and      recording of the deeds whereby the title of the United States      should be evidenced. The contention of the United States that      the evidence of de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction      is sufficient in itself to show probable cause cannot be      disregarded, in view of the quaere in Holt v. United States,      218 U. S. 245, 252, 31 Sup. Ct. 2, 6 (54 L. Ed. 1021, 20 Ann.      Cas. 1138): 'The documents referred to are not before us, but      they properly were introduced, and so far as we can see      justified the finding of the jury, even if the evidence of      the de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction was not      enough, or if the United States was called on to try title in a murder case.' * * * I am of the opinion      that the defendant has failed to overcome the prima facie      case made by the indictment, and that the evidence fails to      show the want of probable cause.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Appeals (Pothier v.
