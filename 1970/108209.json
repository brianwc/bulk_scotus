Also exempt were nonprofit corporations that insured the savings institutions. In 1951, the exemption for savings and loan associations was discontinued, on findings that the industry had developed to a point comparable to that of commercial banks. The exemption for insurers, however, was continued, provided they were already in existence as of September 1, 1951. See Revenue Act of 1951, &#167; 313(b), 65 Stat. 490; S.Rep.No.781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 22&#8212;29; 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 1969, 1991&#8212;1997 (1951). As of that date three private insurers fell within the scope of the section&#8212;two of them in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut. Then, in 1956, a fourth such corporation was organized in Ohio, and four years later Congress moved the cutoff date forward to September 1, 1957.

Testimony before the committee indicated that continued forward movement of the date might lead to proliferation of state insurers that could hinder the operations and threaten the financial stability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

The fact that Congress enacts a statute containing a 'grandfather clause,' which exempts from the general income tax certain corporations organized prior to a specified date, does not of itself indicate that Congress has made an arbitrary classification. Cf. Stanley v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 295 U.S. 76, 55 S.Ct. 628, 79 L.Ed. 1311 (1935); Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. v. Rhodes, 220 U.S. 502, 31 S.Ct. 490, 55 L.Ed. 561 (1911); Watson v.

Normally, a legislative classification will not be set aside if any state of facts rationally justifying it is demonstrated to or perceived by the courts. McDonald v.

See also Watson v. Maryland, supra, 218 U.S. at 178, 30 S.Ct. at 646&#8212;647. Here the legislative history of H.R. 3297 affirmatively discloses that Congress had a rational basis for declining in 1963 to broaden the exemption by extending the cutoff date of &#167; 501(c)(14)(B). Just as a State may provide that after a specified date newly established common carriers must obtain state approval before entering into business so as to prevent proliferation of such carriers and excessive use of the State's highways, see Stanley v. Public Utilities Comm'n, supra, similarly Congress does not exceed its power to tax nor does it violate the Fifth Amendment when it refuses to exempt from tax newly formed corporations, the multiplication of which might burden otherwise valid federal programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having noted probable jurisdiction by order of October 12, 1970, we now reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment of District Court reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice HARLAN, considering that the issues in this case are deserving of plenary consideration, would set the case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Internal Revenue Code &#167; 501(c)(14)(B), 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(14)(B) (1964 ed., Supp. V), provides:</p>\n        <p>'(B) Corporations or associations without capital stock organized before September 1, 1957, and operated for mutual purposes and without profit for the purpose of providing reserve funds for, and insurance of shares or deposits in&#8212;</p>\n        <p>'(i) domestic building and loan associations,</p>\n        <p>'(ii) cooperative banks without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit, or</p>\n        <p>'(iii) mutual savings banks not having capital stock represented by shares.'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The District Court's reliance on Mayflower Farms, Inc. v.
