But, manifestly, the matters <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> referred to form no part of the record and are not adequate to create a federal question when no such question was necessarily decided below, and the record does not disclose that such issues were set up or claimed in any proper manner in the courts of the State.\"</p>\n<p>As we interpret its opinion and judgment the court below ruled only that the order of the Commission fixed rates to be charged, leaving all other questions subject to determination by the courts. Counsel for the Commission affirmed this interpretation and at the bar agreed that judgment here might rest thereon. In printed argument he said: \"Except as to rates, the Commission did not attempt (in fact, expressly disclaimed any attempt) to change any of the provisions of these contracts, and the effect of this rate order, as a matter of law, on those other provisions was left by the Commission for determination by the courts as the occasion might arise.\" The decision below upon this point of local law is enough to support the judgment and leaves no federal question open for our determination.</p>\n<p>In cases where the state court has decided a local question adequate to support its judgment this court has sometimes affirmed, and sometimes has dismissed the writ of error. <i>Murdock</i> v. <i>Memphis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88971\"><a href=\"/opinion/88971/murdock-v-memphis/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, 634-636; <i>Eustis</i> v. <i>Bolles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93710\"><a href=\"/opinion/93710/eustis-v-bolles/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 370; <i>Southern Pacific Co.</i> v. <i>Schuyler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97816\"><a href=\"/opinion/97816/southern-pacific-co-v-schuyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 610; <i>Howat</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 258 U.S. 181; <i>Browne</i> v. <i>Union Pacific,</i> 267 U.S. 255.
