The work was done and the contract price paid. The amount here sued for was made up of nine claims for damages for breaches and extras.

The contractor to accept such equipment as is, and to assume      all responsibility for placing such equipment in first-class working condition,      and the proper care and maintenance of such equipment, from      the time it is turned over to him by the constructing      quartermaster.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Finding No. 2 by the court is:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The right of way furnished by the United States consisted of      railroad tracks running from the site of the work to the      storage yards. These tracks were used by others, and were not      in good condition when the plaintiff submitted its bid, nor      were they in any worse condition when it began its work under      the contract. The United States did not keep the tracks in      good condition during the performance of the contract, but      turned them over to the plaintiff for its use with the      necessary rolling stock. The plaintiff expended the sum of      $705.50 for labor in repairing the tracks and $700.66 for      making repairs to equipment damaged by reason of the      defective tracks; it also expended the further sum of      $1,653.49 for labor in connection with derailments.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the government agreed to furnish was a right of way, not a railroad for transportation. It agreed that ingress and egress by this right of way should, at all times during the performance of the contract, be given the contractor, and such ingress and egress were afforded it. The defective track on the right of way was evident to the contractor when it made the contract, and the reasonable construction of the contract is that the contractor, in order to avail itself of the right of way, with constant ingress and egress, took over the track as it was as part of the equipment for transportation, just as he did the locomotive and cars, and as it found it, with sole responsibility for placing it in working condition and maintaining it for its use. It is clear that the Court of Claims was right in rejecting this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other claim was for damages for delay by the government in arranging for the contractor's start upon the work. The contract provided that the work should be commenced on June 10, 1920, and by that time the contractor had its executive office force at the plant. The contractor was able to begin work on June 13. The delay resulted from the inability to get material issued to the contractor. The actual amount expended for salary and services to the persons kept waiting was $360. No complaint and no protest were made by the contractor at the time, and no claim was filed by the contractor until March 14, 1921. The holding of the Court of Claims was that, because it did not satisfactorily appear that the delay was due wholly to the government, and in view of the absence of a claim or protest for nine months thereafter, the claim should be rejected.
