It cancelled these schedules and determined what thereafter would be maximum reasonable rates upon a mileage basis. Subsequently, the proceedings having been reopened, this order was modified and reaffirmed.

The later order affirmed former findings that the schedules suspended by the one of March 11, 1935, had not been justified, and prescribed future maximum rates upon a mileage basis.

But this contention rests upon an assumed construction of the order not obviously correct. The Commission has not so construed it nor has that body been asked so to do or for any further action in respect of it.
