And whereas in pursuance of the said laws, a general post-office was established at the seat of government of the United States, under the direction of a post-master general, duly appointed and qualified, and a post-road established within the U.

The 5th count varied from the others considerably in the recital, respecting the establishment of post-roads and post-offices; but the principal difference consisted in an averment, that the post-masters, appointed by the post-master general, were to perform their duties according to law, '<i>and to the instructions of the post-master general relative to their duty</i>.' That the post-office at Washington was a <i>distributing</i> office, and that it was the duty of the Defendant, according to the instructions of the post-master general then in force, to open the mail addressed '<i>Southern</i>,' and to <i>distribute</i> and <i>re-mail</i> the letters and packets into proper mails before the departure of the mail; and on no account to <i>delay them a single post</i>, by which it was in his power to send them in the regular course of the mail.

The 5th plea was also to the 1st and 3d counts, and averred, that as to the Defendants having <i>personally</i> received the said letter, &amp;c. and as to his having <i>fraudulently secreted, withheld, and taken the same</i>, &amp;c. he was <i>not guilty</i>, and of this he put himself upon the country; and the Plaintiffs likewise. And as to the <i>residue</i> of the allegations, charges, and complaints of fraud and misconduct, in the two last mentioned counts of the said declaration above, supposed to have been committed in the said post-office at Washington by some other person employed by the Defendant in the said office, he says that the Plaintiffs, their action aforesaid, to have, &amp;c. ought not, because he says, that at the time when, &amp;c. and always before and ever since, the Defendant, in pursuance of regulations and instructions duly made and issued by the post-master general, <i>took due precaution and exercised all reasonable care, diligence and circumspection</i>, to cause all mails, letters and packets brought to the said office, to be duly sent on and forwarded according to the destination of the same, and to prevent all frauds and embezzlements in the said office, <i>by selecting, appointing, and employing as clerks and assistants in the said office, and to attend in the said office at the regular hours directed by the post-master general, for the purpose of performing the duties of the same, none but persons of competent skill and knowledge, of fair character, of known good repute for fidelity and honesty</i>, and who, upon being so appointed and employed, and previous to entering upon the duties assigned them as aforesaid, or the execution of their trusts aforesaid, had, in pursuance of the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and in obedience to the express instructions of the post-master general, respectively taken and subscribed, before a magistrate, in due manner and form, the oath prescribed by the said act of Congress, and also the oath, in due manner and form, as directed by the post-master general aforesaid; that is to say, an oath to support the constitution of the United States, and had respectively transmitted to, and caused to be duly filed in the general post-office certificates, in due form, of the said oaths so taken and subscribed as aforesaid. <i>And the said Defendant in fact says</i>, that at the time when, &amp;c. and for a long time before and after, <i>he had with due precation and circumspection, and with all reasonable care and diligence</i>, and in pursuance of regulations and instructions duly made and issued by the post-master general of the U.

The plea is argumentative in this, that it states that the Defendant has appointed competent and honest men to do the duties of the said office, and therefore infers that he himself is not liable for their negligence; and further, in this, that he states what acts he did in relation to his office, and reasons from them in his exculpation. 2. Because the plea does not confess and avoid, nor deny the allegations of the said counts or of any of them. 3. Because it does not state the nature and circumstances of error or mistake supposed to be made by his said clerks and assistants, so as to show that it did not proceed from a want of reasonable care and diligence. 4. Bucause the plea amounts to the general issues. 5. Because it does not set forth any matter of law proper for the decision of the Court, but states facts proper to be given in evidence upon the general issue joined between the parties. 6. Because the plea tends to draw from the consideration of the jury to that of the Court, matters of evidence proper to be shewn only to the jury on the general issue; and is immaterial, insufficient and informal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.

The first bill of exception stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence to the jury that the Defendant was deputy post-master at the city of Washington from the 1st of January, 1806, until the time of trial, and had under his management and direction the affairs and business of the post-office at that place; and the Plaintiffs produced and read to the jury the printed instructions of the post-master general of the United States; and proved by a witness that those were the instructions delivered to the Defendant for his government in the duties of his office as deputy post-master in the city of Washington. The Plaintiffs further produced to the jury evidence that they had $2,000 in bank notes in the hands of Walker and Kennedy, merchants at Philadelphia, and that that sum of money, in bank notes, was enclosed in a sealed letter and directed to the Plaintiffs, at Petersburgh in Virginia, the place of their residence, and put into the post-office at Philadelphia, and was by the post-master at that place forwarded in the mail addressed to the <i>state of Virginia</i> on the 31st of July 1806. That it arrived <i>in due course of post</i> at the post-office in the city of Washington under the care and management of the Defendant. That it was the duty of the office at Washington, as a distributing office, to open the said mail so addressed, and to forward to Petersburgh in Virginia the said letter according to its address. That the said letter was lost and never arrived at the post-office in Petersburgh nor came to the hands of the Plaintiffs, and that the same was demanded of the Defendant, who denied he was liable for it. It was admitted that the course of conveying the mail from Philadelphia to Petersburgh is as follows: the Virginia mail, tied with a string and wrapt in papers, is, with many other mails similarly secured, enclosed in a locked portmanteau, and sent by stage to the city of Washington, distant 144 miles. No person or post-office between Philadelphia and Washington is legally authorized to open the mail addressed to Virginia; but the portmanteau is unlocked and opened at the Baltimore post-office, and the various mails are there taken out of the portmanteau, in order to select the Baltimore mail. When the mail arrives at the post-office in Washington the mail addressed to Virginia is opened in said office as a distributing office, and the letters addressed to Petersburgh assorted, tied and wrapped as aforesaid, and put into a mail addressed to the post-office at Petersburgh. The said Petersburgh mail so tied and wrapped is, with many other mails, put into the portmanteau, which is locked and opened on the route only at Fredericksburgh and Richmond. But the said Petersburgh mail, wrapped in paper and tied with a string as aforesaid, though it may properly be taken out of the portmanteau with the other mails at Fredericksburgh and Richmond as aforesaid, cannot be legally opened at any office between Washington and Petersburgh. <i>Whereupon</i> the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury, that if they should find the above facts to be true the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this case on their 2d count, unless the Defendant should prove the said letter to have been forwarded from his office <i>in the time</i> and manner prescribed by law <i>and the said instructions</i> of the post-master general; which opinion the Court refused to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The 2d bill of exceptions stated the same facts, and that thereupon the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if they should find those facts to be true, then the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this case upon their 4th and 5th counts, unless the Plaintiff should prove the said letter to have been forwarded from his office <i>in reasonable time</i>, and in the manner prescribed by law and the instructions of the post-master general; which instruction the Court refused to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The 3d bill of exception stated, that, in addition to the above facts, the Plaintiffs offered evidence, under the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas, to prove that the letter and bank notes were lost by the negligence and carelessness of Henry Whetcroft and William Hewitt sworn clerks and assistants employed by the Defendant in his said post-office; and also certain acts of omission, undue delay and detention of the said letter and bank notes by such clerks and assistants of the Defendant; to the competency of which evidence to support the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas on the part of Plaintiffs, the Defendant objected; and the Court was of opinion that under those issues such evidence was incompetent, and refused to suffer the same to be given to the jury under those issues; and instructed the jury that the Defendant was not liable <i>under those issues</i> for any acts or omissions of his said clerks and assistants: to which refusal and opinion the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The 4th bill of exceptions stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence of the facts stated in their 5th and 8th counts, and moved the Court to instruct the jury that if they should believe from the evidence that the letter and bank notes were duly delivered into the Defendant's post-office, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were duly forwarded. And if the jury should further believe that the same were not so forwarded and had become lost, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were not lost by any undue negligence or unreasonable detention of himself or any person employed by him in his office; which instruction the Court refused to give; but instructed them that if the jury should believe from the evidence that the letter and bank notes were duly delivered into the Defendant's office, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were duly forwarded; and if the jury should further believe that the same were so delivered and were not so forwarded, and had become lost <i>in consequence thereof;</i> then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were not lost by any undue negligence and unreasonable detention of himself or any other person employed by him in his office. To which refusal the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The 5th bill of exceptions stated, in addition to the facts before stated, that the Plaintiffs offered in evidence a copy of a post-bill from Philadelphia, of the 34st of July, 1806, (shewing that a letter whose postage was one dollar and 20 cents, corresponding with the postage upon the letter in question, was charged in the post bill from Philadelphia to the state of Virginia,) and offered to prove that the post-bill, of which it was a copy, was received at the Defendants post-office with letters in the mail from Philadelphia. And the Defendant offered evidence to prove that it never was the custom, until after the report of the loss of the letter and bank notes in question, for the <i>actual contents of the mails</i>, sent to the said office for distribution, to be compared with the <i>contents noted in the accompanying post-bills</i>; except that it was customary to examine the column of <i>paid letters</i> in order to see whether as many <i>paid</i> letters, and of the same amount of postage, came on in the mail; that this was done because the deputy post-master had to account to the post-master general for all letters sent on from his office and marked <i>paid;</i> whether originally put into his office, or coming there in mails for distribution; and according to the <i>routine</i> of office, any deficiency, appearing on the arrival of the mail, in the amount of postage marked in his post-bill as '<i>paid</i>,' would be chargeable to him; that in no other respect was any attention paid, or notice taken, whether the actual contents of the mail, as to any letters not marked '<i>paid</i>,' corresponded, or not, with the <i>post-bill</i>. That if, by accident, any variance between the post-bill and the actual contents of the mail received for distribution, was discovered, it would never be noted in the office, inasmuch as the printed forms, furnished to the Defendant and other deputy post-masters, from the post-master general for the account of mails <i>for distribution</i>, contained no column for noting letters either over-charged, or under-charged, or miss-sent, such as are to be found in the form furnished for account of mails for <i>delivery</i>, and marked No. 1, in the schedule annexed to the instructions of 1804.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereupon, the Plaintiffs prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the copy of the post-bill produced was a true copy of the post-bill sent on from Philadelphia to the Washington post-office, and that the same was received with letters in the mail from Philadelphia at the Defendants office, then the jury <i>ought</i> to presume that the letters accompanying the said post-bill corresponded therewith, unless the Defendant should prove the contrary; which instruction the Court refused to give as prayed; but instructed the jury that <i>it is competent</i> for them, from those circumstances, so to presume; and to decide upon the force of such presumption from all the circumstances proved in the case; to which refusal and instruction the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The 6th exception was to the refusal of the Court to suffer a witness to be asked whether the printed general instructions from the post-master general given to the deputy post-masters in 1804, <i>superseded</i> those before given to the post-master in Philadelphia in 1800; both instructions having been produced and read in evidence to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The 7th bill of exceptions stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence to '<i>prove the several allegations in the said declaration;</i> and further offered in evidence the several printed instructions of the post-master general (thereto annexed) and also the depositions (thereto annexed and which tended to prove the delivery of the letter and bank notes into the post-office at Philadelphia, and their arrival at the post-office in Washington.) And the Defendant offered evidence to prove that Petersburgh, ever since the 1st of November, 1804, was a distributing post-office as established by the said instructions; that after the said instructions it was the practice of post-offices, (except that of Philadelphia) in which letters were deposited for Petersburgh, to put the same up in a separate mail addressed to Petersbugh, and not in the Virginia state mail. That the Philadelphia post-office, since the said 1st of August, 1806, and not before, has adopted the same practice. That the Virginia state mail above mentioned contained the letters directed to the several post-offices in Virginia, except Norfolk and Richmond, and also the letters directed to the states of Ohio and Kentucky; and that before the letters for Petersbugh contained in the said mail could be distributed and re-mailed, it was necessary to assort and distribute the whole contents of the said mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Plaintiffs then moved the Court to instruct the jury, that if they should believe from the evidence, that the letter and the bank notes in the declaration mentioned, were put, at the post office in Philadelphia, in a bundle superscribed '<i>Virginia state mails</i>,' and that it had been, since the year 1800, and was the practice, in the said Philadelphia post-office during the months of July and August, 1806, to send letters for delivery at Petersburgh, Virginia, in that manner; and that all letters in the Virginia state mail, for Petersburgh, Virginia, brought to the Defendant's office, had been usually re-mailed, distributed, and sent on from the post-office kept by the Defendant, to Petersburgh aforesaid; and should be further of opinion that the said letter, containing the said bank notes, was delivered in the said bundle superscribed 'Virginia state mail,' on the first day of August, 1806, in the said office of the Defendant, and in due time to be re-mailed, distributed and sent on by the Defendant on the first day of August, 1806, from his aforesaid office, in a bundle addressed to Petersburgh, Virginia, then it was the duty of the said Defendant to have re-mailed, distributed, and sent on the said letter by the mail which left the Washington post-office on the said first day of August, 1806; and if they further believe that this was not so done, or caused to be done by the said Defendant, that it is incumbent on the Defendant to make out a just, reasonable and sufficient excuse for the omission.' which instruction the Court-refused to give as prayed; and the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of congress of March 2d, 1799, <i>Vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 505, establishes a general post-office at the seat of government of the United States, under the direction of a post-master general; and enacts that he shall establish post-offices, and appoint post-masters at all such places as shall appear to him expedient, on the post-roads that are or may be established by law.

This bill of exceptions arose upon the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas. The 6th plea was, that the letter was not lost by the negligence or misconduct of the <i>Defendant</i> in his office&#8212;and the 10th was, that the <i>Defendant</i> had not negligently or improperly delayed or detained the letter in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law in respect to the liability of the <i>post-master general</i> is admitted to be the same here as it is stated in <i>Ld. le Despencer's</i> case, (<i>Cowp.</i> 754.) to be in England. But the opinion of lord <i>Mansfield</i>, in that case, clearly shows that the action lies in the present case. In the case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 659, it is decided that a declaration which charges the Defendant with negligence, is supported by proof of the negligence of his servant. Where the negligence is in a post-office, it is scarcely possible, in any case, for a Plaintiff to know exactly to which of the persons, employed in the office, the negligence is to be attributed. If, as the Court below decided, the Defendant is liable for the negligence of his clerks, it seems to be immaterial whether the declaration state the neglect to be on the part of the Defendant or of his clerks; or state it in the alternative. A collector of the revenue is liable for his deputies, although they are sworn officers. Yet the secretary of the treasury is not liable for the collectors. So the marshal is liable for his deputies, who are also sworn officers, and who give bond for the faithful discharge of their duty. Why should there be a difference in the case of a post-master?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 4th exception is, that the Court refused to instruct the jury, that proof of negligence and loss raised a presumption that the loss was a consequence of the negligence, unless the contrary be shown. Or, in other words, the Court below decided, that proof of negligence and loss did not throw the burden of proof on the defendant, to show that the loss was not a consequence of the negligence. To oblige the Plaintiffs to prove, that the loss was a consequence of that negligence, was to impose upon them an impossibility in the nature of things.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5th exception is to the refusal of the Court to instruct the jury, that they <i>ought</i> to infer that the contents of the mail from Philadelphia corresponded with the post-bill when it was received at the Washington office, unless the Defendant should prove the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What a jury may <i>infer</i> from facts proved, is a question of law for the Court to decide. And what a jury <i>may</i> thus infer, they <i>are bound in law</i> to infer, unless the contrary be proved. The Court, therefore, ought not to have left the matter entirely to the jury, but to have given the instruction as prayed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumptions are inferences of law. Thus from long possession, the Court will instruct the jury that they <i>ought</i> to presume a deed. So from evidence of payment of the last ten years rent, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume all the former rents were paid. So in trover, from evidence of a demand and refusal, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume a conversion. So, if stolen goods are found in possession of a man, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume that he stole them, unless the contrary be shewn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 7th exception raises the question whether the Defendant was not bound to re-mail and send on the letter, according to law, and the instructions of the post-master general, although the mail arrived at his office in an irregular manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this point the 5th section of the post-office law, (<i>vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 507,) and the instructions, are decisive. These instructions being given in conformity with the law, become part thereof, and are equally binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JONES and MORSELL, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the questions in this case are resolved into one, viz. On which side was the burden of proof in certain stages of the trial. All the exceptions are grounded upon the idea, that it was only necessary for the Plaintiffs to show negligence in the office, and a loss of the letter, without showing that the loss was a <i>consequence</i> of the negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We admit that the Defendant is liable for any loss happening by his own negligence&#8212;but we deny that he is liable for that of his clerks. The act of Congress requires that the Defendant should employ clerks, and that they should be sworn, and imposes specific penalties upon each person employed in the office for his own misconduct. They are all public officers, and liable to be charged <i>ex delictu officii</i>. The post-master is only bound to use due care and circumspection in selecting proper clerks. He is not like a common carrier, who receives hire in proportion to the risk, and the value of the article. He has only a compensation for his trouble in the office. The liability of a master arises from his supposed assent, arising from the fact that the servant is employed for the benefit of the master. But here the clerk does not act for the post-master, but for the public. The servant must be employed in the business of the master and for his benefit, or the latter will not be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHNSON, J. It has never been attempted to assimilate him to a common carrier. He has nothing to do with the carrying of the mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JONES. It is decided in England, that the <i>post-master general</i> in England is not liable for his deputies. <i>Lane v. Cotton</i>. 1 <i>Ld. Ray.</i> 647. 1 <i>Salk.</i> 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instructions from our post-master general to the post-masters, that they should be liable for their deputies or clerk, &amp;c. only means that they shall be liable in accounting with him officially for the revenue. He could not make them liable to individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of <i>Rowning v. Goodchild</i>, 2 <i>W. Bl.</i> 906. 3 <i>Wils.</i> 443, the principal question was, whether the post-master was bound to send out the letters to the inhabitants; but a question incidentally arose whether the action, which was brought against the <i>deputy</i> post-master, should not have been brought against the post-master <i>general</i>. The Court, however, was of opinion, that in all cases, deputies are answerable for their own personal misfeasance, such as detaining the letter in question. And in that case the deputies were made, by act of parliament, <i>ex necessitate rei</i>, substantive officers, and their duty pointed out as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the Defendant was liable for the default of his clerks, yet the declaration ought to have shown, whether the Defendant was called upon to account for his own negligence, or that of his clerks. The case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 659, was reluctantly decided upon the authority of <i>Turberville v. Stampe, Ld. Ray.</i> 264, but which does not support the case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, which is evidently against principle; and at all events is confined to the case of master and servant. In the following cases, a discrimination is made in the declaration between the act of the master, and that of his servants. <i>Turner v. Hawkins</i>, 1 <i>Bos. &amp; Pull.</i> 472. <i>Ogle v. Barnes</i>, 8 <i>T. R.</i> 188. <i>Savignac v. Roome</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumptions arising from circumstantial evidence are always to be left to the jury. Such a positive inference as will justify the Court in directing the jary, that they <i>ought</i> to make it, can arise only from some solemn act. In the present case there was other evidence, showing that no such inference could be drawn as the Plaintiffs had supposed; and therefore the Court did right to leave the whole to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 7th exception required the Court to say, that the Defendant was bound to send on the letter on the 1st of August, or to show a reasonable excuse for not sending it on, although the mail was made up in an irregular manner in Philadelphia. The idea of <i>reasonable diligence</i> is excluded&#8212;and it supposes the Defendant bound at all events to send the letter on by that mail, or to give a sufficient excuse for not doing so, although he sent it by the next mail, and although the loss was not the consequence of not sending it on the 1st of August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendant was not bound to show that he sent it on; it would be impossible in the course of the business of the office to prove the sending on of every particular letter. Sworn officers are presumed to have done their duty, until the contrary is proved. 3 <i>East. Williams v. E. I. Company</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>March</i> 14<i>th. All the Judges being present</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHNSON, J. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows: It is necessary to dissipate the cloud of pleading in which this case is enveloped, in order to form a distinct idea of the questions intended to be brought to the view of the Court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The object is to charge the post-master with the loss of money sent by mail; and the points, which the exceptions are intended to make, are, how far he is liable for his own act or neglect, how far for the acts or neglect of his assistants, and what evidence shall be sufficient to support the Plaintiff's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But unfortunately, as not unfrequently happens in this complex and injudicious mode of conducting a suit, with all the clerical skill displayed by counsel in multiplying their counts and pointing their bills of exceptions, the principal questions are really, at last, not brought to the view of this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first and second exception it is unnecessary to make any remark, as they are admitted to apply to counts which the evidence did not support and have been, in fact, abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third exception is intended to raise the question how far a post-master is liable for the neglect of his assistants; but, connected with the pleadings, it presents another and a very different question, to wit, whether, when the issue is taken upon the neglect of the post-master himself, it is competent to give in evidence, neglect in the assistant acting under him. Now the distinction between the relation of a post-master to his sworn assistant acting under him, and between master and servant generally, has long been settled; and although the latter relation might sanction the admission of such evidence, we are unanimously of opinion that, if it is intended to charge a post-master for the negligence of his assistants, the pleadings must be made up according to the case; and his liability then will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge of their duties in his office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fourth exception, the only difference between the opinion prayed for and that given, is, that the Court require the loss to be a <i>consequence</i> of not forwarding the letter described in the declaration. Now, in justice to the correctness of the Plaintiffs' counsel, this Court hope that they meant nothing more than what the Court conceded; for, certainly, if the loss was not a consequence of the state of things made out in the evidence, they were not entitled to recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fifth exception it is only necessary to remark, that if the Court below erred at all, it was in conceding too much to the prayer of the Plaintiff. An entry on the post-bill is by no means conclusive evidence of the transmission of a letter, for, it may still never have been put into the mail, or may have been stolen in its passage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sixth exception is equally untenable. The instructions of the post-master general spoke for themselves. If the one superseded or rescinded the other, the evidence was to be sought for by comparing them together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the seventh exception affords the Court an opportunity to remark how much more conducive to the purposes of justice it would be to substitute special verdicts, and demurrers to evidence, for the tedious and embarrassing practice of the Court from which this case comes up. It is a fact that this bill of exceptions claims a right of recovery without stating any loss or damage whatever. The opinion prayed for was, that if the jury believed the various facts therein detailed, then it is incumbent on the Defendant to make out a just, reasonable and sufficient excuse for omitting to forward the letter deseribed. But, unless an individual has sustained some loss or damage by an omission of that kind, why should the post-master be held to make out a defence? Each bill of exceptions must be considered as presenting a distinct, substantive case; and it is on the evidence stated in itself alone that the Court is to decide. We cannot go beyond it and collect other facts which must have been in the mind of the party, and the insertion of which in this bill of exceptions could alone have sanctioned the opinion as prayed for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The 5th count varied from the others considerably in the recital, respecting the establishment of post-roads and post-offices; but the principal difference consisted in an averment, that the post-masters, appointed by the post-master general, were to perform their duties according to law, '<i>and to the instructions of the post-master general relative to their duty</i>.'

Whereas the said letter, &amp;c. was not, &amp;c. but together with all the other letters sent by the same post, and directed and destined for Petersburgh, was contrary to the said regulations, &amp;c. sent on from Philadelphia in a mail which, according to the direction of the same, and the said regulations, &amp;c. was to be opened at the post-office in Washington for the purpose of being distributed and re-mailed, &amp;c.; and the Defendant says that if the said letter, &amp;c. had been put up in a distinct and separate mail directed to Petersburgh, it would have been duly sent on in the mail of the first of August, and so the delay was occasioned by the erroneous and irregular manner in which the letter was put up and sent on from Philadelplia, and not by the negligence, carelessness or misconduct of the Defendant in his office: '<i>without this</i> that the said letter was put and forwarded in the mail at and from Philadelphia, and delivered at the said post-office in Washington in any other manner than as aforesaid, and this he is ready to verify,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this plea, <i>as pleaded to the 5th count</i>, the Plaintiffs demurred; and <i>as pleaded to the other counts</i>, they replied, and (after protesting that the post-master at Philadelphia was not bound to send on the letter in a separate mail directed to Petersburgh, &amp;c. and protesting that the loss of the letter or the delay, &amp;c. was not occasioned by the supposed erroneous manner in which it was put up and sent on from Philadelphia) for replication said, that the letter, &amp; c. was put up and forwarded by the post-master at Philadelphia, according to the said instructions of the post-master general, in a mail addressed '<i>Southern</i>,' containing the letters addressed to places in Virginia, and was thereafter duly and regularly placed in the post-office in Washington on the 1st of August to be re-mailed and sent on in the mail of that day, and that the delay and loss were not occasioned by any error or irregularity in the manner in which it was put up and sent on from Philadelphia, but was occasioned by the want of due and reasonable care and diligence in the performance of the duties of the post-office at Washington on the first of August; and concluded to the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this replication the Defendant demurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the demurrers were decided by the Court below in favor of the Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial of the issues of fact the Plaintiffs took seven bills of exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The first bill of exception stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence to the jury that the Defendant was deputy post-master at the city of Washington from the 1st of January, 1806, until the time of trial, and had under his management and direction the affairs and business of the post-office at that place; and the Plaintiffs produced and read to the jury the printed instructions of the post-master general of the United States; and proved by a witness that those were the instructions delivered to the Defendant for his government in the duties of his office as deputy post-master in the city of Washington. The Plaintiffs further produced to the jury evidence that they had $2,000 in bank notes in the hands of Walker and Kennedy, merchants at Philadelphia, and that that sum of money, in bank notes, was enclosed in a sealed letter and directed to the Plaintiffs, at Petersburgh in Virginia, the place of their residence, and put into the post-office at Philadelphia, and was by the post-master at that place forwarded in the mail addressed to the <i>state of Virginia</i> on the 31st of July 1806. That it arrived <i>in due course of post</i> at the post-office in the city of Washington under the care and management of the Defendant. That it was the duty of the office at Washington, as a distributing office, to open the said mail so addressed, and to forward to Petersburgh in Virginia the said letter according to its address. That the said letter was lost and never arrived at the post-office in Petersburgh nor came to the hands of the Plaintiffs, and that the same was demanded of the Defendant, who denied he was liable for it. It was admitted that the course of conveying the mail from Philadelphia to Petersburgh is as follows: the Virginia mail, tied with a string and wrapt in papers, is, with many other mails similarly secured, enclosed in a locked portmanteau, and sent by stage to the city of Washington, distant 144 miles. No person or post-office between Philadelphia and Washington is legally authorized to open the mail addressed to Virginia; but the portmanteau is unlocked and opened at the Baltimore post-office, and the various mails are there taken out of the portmanteau, in order to select the Baltimore mail. When the mail arrives at the post-office in Washington the mail addressed to Virginia is opened in said office as a distributing office, and the letters addressed to Petersburgh assorted, tied and wrapped as aforesaid, and put into a mail addressed to the post-office at Petersburgh. The said Petersburgh mail so tied and wrapped is, with many other mails, put into the portmanteau, which is locked and opened on the route only at Fredericksburgh and Richmond. But the said Petersburgh mail, wrapped in paper and tied with a string as aforesaid, though it may properly be taken out of the portmanteau with the other mails at Fredericksburgh and Richmond as aforesaid, cannot be legally opened at any office between Washington and Petersburgh. <i>Whereupon</i> the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury, that if they should find the above facts to be true the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this case on their 2d count, unless the Defendant should prove the said letter to have been forwarded from his office <i>in the time</i> and manner prescribed by law <i>and the said instructions</i> of the post-master general; which opinion the Court refused to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The 2d bill of exceptions stated the same facts, and that thereupon the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if they should find those facts to be true, then the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this case upon their 4th and 5th counts, unless the Plaintiff should prove the said letter to have been forwarded from his office <i>in reasonable time</i>, and in the manner prescribed by law and the instructions of the post-master general; which instruction the Court refused to give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The 3d bill of exception stated, that, in addition to the above facts, the Plaintiffs offered evidence, under the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas, to prove that the letter and bank notes were lost by the negligence and carelessness of Henry Whetcroft and William Hewitt sworn clerks and assistants employed by the Defendant in his said post-office; and also certain acts of omission, undue delay and detention of the said letter and bank notes by such clerks and assistants of the Defendant; to the competency of which evidence to support the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas on the part of Plaintiffs, the Defendant objected; and the Court was of opinion that under those issues such evidence was incompetent, and refused to suffer the same to be given to the jury under those issues; and instructed the jury that the Defendant was not liable <i>under those issues</i> for any acts or omissions of his said clerks and assistants: to which refusal and opinion the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The 4th bill of exceptions stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence of the facts stated in their 5th and 8th counts, and moved the Court to instruct the jury that if they should believe from the evidence that the letter and bank notes were duly delivered into the Defendant's post-office, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were duly forwarded. And if the jury should further believe that the same were not so forwarded and had become lost, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were not lost by any undue negligence or unreasonable detention of himself or any person employed by him in his office; which instruction the Court refused to give; but instructed them that if the jury should believe from the evidence that the letter and bank notes were duly delivered into the Defendant's office, then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were duly forwarded; and if the jury should further believe that the same were so delivered and were not so forwarded, and had become lost <i>in consequence thereof;</i> then it was incumbent on the Defendant to prove that the same were not lost by any undue negligence and unreasonable detention of himself or any other person employed by him in his office. To which refusal the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The 5th bill of exceptions stated, in addition to the facts before stated, that the Plaintiffs offered in evidence a copy of a post-bill from Philadelphia, of the 34st of July, 1806, (shewing that a letter whose postage was one dollar and 20 cents, corresponding with the postage upon the letter in question, was charged in the post bill from Philadelphia to the state of Virginia,) and offered to prove that the post-bill, of which it was a copy, was received at the Defendants post-office with letters in the mail from Philadelphia. And the Defendant offered evidence to prove that it never was the custom, until after the report of the loss of the letter and bank notes in question, for the <i>actual contents of the mails</i>, sent to the said office for distribution, to be compared with the <i>contents noted in the accompanying post-bills</i>; except that it was customary to examine the column of <i>paid letters</i> in order to see whether as many <i>paid</i> letters, and of the same amount of postage, came on in the mail; that this was done because the deputy post-master had to account to the post-master general for all letters sent on from his office and marked <i>paid;</i> whether originally put into his office, or coming there in mails for distribution; and according to the <i>routine</i> of office, any deficiency, appearing on the arrival of the mail, in the amount of postage marked in his post-bill as '<i>paid</i>,' would be chargeable to him; that in no other respect was any attention paid, or notice taken, whether the actual contents of the mail, as to any letters not marked '<i>paid</i>,' corresponded, or not, with the <i>post-bill</i>. That if, by accident, any variance between the post-bill and the actual contents of the mail received for distribution, was discovered, it would never be noted in the office, inasmuch as the printed forms, furnished to the Defendant and other deputy post-masters, from the post-master general for the account of mails <i>for distribution</i>, contained no column for noting letters either over-charged, or under-charged, or miss-sent, such as are to be found in the form furnished for account of mails for <i>delivery</i>, and marked No. 1, in the schedule annexed to the instructions of 1804.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereupon, the Plaintiffs prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the copy of the post-bill produced was a true copy of the post-bill sent on from Philadelphia to the Washington post-office, and that the same was received with letters in the mail from Philadelphia at the Defendants office, then the jury <i>ought</i> to presume that the letters accompanying the said post-bill corresponded therewith, unless the Defendant should prove the contrary; which instruction the Court refused to give as prayed; but instructed the jury that <i>it is competent</i> for them, from those circumstances, so to presume; and to decide upon the force of such presumption from all the circumstances proved in the case; to which refusal and instruction the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The 6th exception was to the refusal of the Court to suffer a witness to be asked whether the printed general instructions from the post-master general given to the deputy post-masters in 1804, <i>superseded</i> those before given to the post-master in Philadelphia in 1800; both instructions having been produced and read in evidence to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The 7th bill of exceptions stated that the Plaintiffs offered evidence to '<i>prove the several allegations in the said declaration;</i> and further offered in evidence the several printed instructions of the post-master general (thereto annexed) and also the depositions (thereto annexed and which tended to prove the delivery of the letter and bank notes into the post-office at Philadelphia, and their arrival at the post-office in Washington.) And the Defendant offered evidence to prove that Petersburgh, ever since the 1st of November, 1804, was a distributing post-office as established by the said instructions; that after the said instructions it was the practice of post-offices, (except that of Philadelphia) in which letters were deposited for Petersburgh, to put the same up in a separate mail addressed to Petersbugh, and not in the Virginia state mail. That the Philadelphia post-office, since the said 1st of August, 1806, and not before, has adopted the same practice. That the Virginia state mail above mentioned contained the letters directed to the several post-offices in Virginia, except Norfolk and Richmond, and also the letters directed to the states of Ohio and Kentucky; and that before the letters for Petersbugh contained in the said mail could be distributed and re-mailed, it was necessary to assort and distribute the whole contents of the said mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Plaintiffs then moved the Court to instruct the jury, that if they should believe from the evidence, that the letter and the bank notes in the declaration mentioned, were put, at the post office in Philadelphia, in a bundle superscribed '<i>Virginia state mails</i>,' and that it had been, since the year 1800, and was the practice, in the said Philadelphia post-office during the months of July and August, 1806, to send letters for delivery at Petersburgh, Virginia, in that manner; and that all letters in the Virginia state mail, for Petersburgh, Virginia, brought to the Defendant's office, had been usually re-mailed, distributed, and sent on from the post-office kept by the Defendant, to Petersburgh aforesaid; and should be further of opinion that the said letter, containing the said bank notes, was delivered in the said bundle superscribed 'Virginia state mail,' on the first day of August, 1806, in the said office of the Defendant, and in due time to be re-mailed, distributed and sent on by the Defendant on the first day of August, 1806, from his aforesaid office, in a bundle addressed to Petersburgh, Virginia, then it was the duty of the said Defendant to have re-mailed, distributed, and sent on the said letter by the mail which left the Washington post-office on the said first day of August, 1806; and if they further believe that this was not so done, or caused to be done by the said Defendant, that it is incumbent on the Defendant to make out a just, reasonable and sufficient excuse for the omission.' which instruction the Court-refused to give as prayed; and the Plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of congress of March 2d, 1799, <i>Vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 505, establishes a general post-office at the seat of government of the United States, under the direction of a post-master general; and enacts that he shall establish post-offices, and appoint post-masters at all such places as shall appear to him expedient, on the post-roads that are or may be established by law.

That every post-master shall keep an office in which one or more persons shall attend at such hours as the post-master general shall direct, for the purpose of performing the duties thereof, and all letters brought to any post-office half an hour before the time of making up the mail of such office, shall be forwarded therein; except at such post-offices where, in the opinion of the post-master general, it requires more time for making up the mail, and which he shall accordingly prescribe; but this shall in no case exceed one hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That if any person employed in any of the departments of the general post-office shall secrete, embezzle, or destroy any letter with which he shall be entrusted, or which shall have come to his possession and intended to be conveyed by post, containing any bank note, &amp;c. he shall, on conviction, be publicly whipped not exceeding forty stripes, and be imprisoned not exceeding ten-years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the post-master general be authorized to allow to the post-masters, respectively, such commission on the monies arising from the postages, or shall be adequate to their respective services and expenses; not exceeding, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instructions of the post-master general, issued in pursuance of this act, to the post-masters in 1804, required that every person employed in a post-office as assistant or clerk should take the oath, and send a certificate thereof to the general post-office.

This bill of exceptions arose upon the issues joined on the 6th and 10th pleas. The 6th plea was, that the letter was not lost by the negligence or misconduct of the <i>Defendant</i> in his office&#8212;and the 10th was, that the <i>Defendant</i> had not negligently or improperly delayed or detained the letter in the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law in respect to the liability of the <i>post-master general</i> is admitted to be the same here as it is stated in <i>Ld. le Despencer's</i> case, (<i>Cowp.</i> 754.) to be in England. But the opinion of lord <i>Mansfield</i>, in that case, clearly shows that the action lies in the present case. In the case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 659, it is decided that a declaration which charges the Defendant with negligence, is supported by proof of the negligence of his servant. Where the negligence is in a post-office, it is scarcely possible, in any case, for a Plaintiff to know exactly to which of the persons, employed in the office, the negligence is to be attributed. If, as the Court below decided, the Defendant is liable for the negligence of his clerks, it seems to be immaterial whether the declaration state the neglect to be on the part of the Defendant or of his clerks; or state it in the alternative. A collector of the revenue is liable for his deputies, although they are sworn officers. Yet the secretary of the treasury is not liable for the collectors. So the marshal is liable for his deputies, who are also sworn officers, and who give bond for the faithful discharge of their duty. Why should there be a difference in the case of a post-master?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 4th exception is, that the Court refused to instruct the jury, that proof of negligence and loss raised a presumption that the loss was a consequence of the negligence, unless the contrary be shown. Or, in other words, the Court below decided, that proof of negligence and loss did not throw the burden of proof on the defendant, to show that the loss was not a consequence of the negligence. To oblige the Plaintiffs to prove, that the loss was a consequence of that negligence, was to impose upon them an impossibility in the nature of things.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5th exception is to the refusal of the Court to instruct the jury, that they <i>ought</i> to infer that the contents of the mail from Philadelphia corresponded with the post-bill when it was received at the Washington office, unless the Defendant should prove the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What a jury may <i>infer</i> from facts proved, is a question of law for the Court to decide. And what a jury <i>may</i> thus infer, they <i>are bound in law</i> to infer, unless the contrary be proved. The Court, therefore, ought not to have left the matter entirely to the jury, but to have given the instruction as prayed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumptions are inferences of law. Thus from long possession, the Court will instruct the jury that they <i>ought</i> to presume a deed. So from evidence of payment of the last ten years rent, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume all the former rents were paid. So in trover, from evidence of a demand and refusal, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume a conversion. So, if stolen goods are found in possession of a man, the jury <i>ought</i> to presume that he stole them, unless the contrary be shewn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 7th exception raises the question whether the Defendant was not bound to re-mail and send on the letter, according to law, and the instructions of the post-master general, although the mail arrived at his office in an irregular manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this point the 5th section of the post-office law, (<i>vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 507,) and the instructions, are decisive. These instructions being given in conformity with the law, become part thereof, and are equally binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JONES and MORSELL, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the questions in this case are resolved into one, viz. On which side was the burden of proof in certain stages of the trial. All the exceptions are grounded upon the idea, that it was only necessary for the Plaintiffs to show negligence in the office, and a loss of the letter, without showing that the loss was a <i>consequence</i> of the negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We admit that the Defendant is liable for any loss happening by his own negligence&#8212;but we deny that he is liable for that of his clerks. The act of Congress requires that the Defendant should employ clerks, and that they should be sworn, and imposes specific penalties upon each person employed in the office for his own misconduct. They are all public officers, and liable to be charged <i>ex delictu officii</i>. The post-master is only bound to use due care and circumspection in selecting proper clerks. He is not like a common carrier, who receives hire in proportion to the risk, and the value of the article. He has only a compensation for his trouble in the office. The liability of a master arises from his supposed assent, arising from the fact that the servant is employed for the benefit of the master. But here the clerk does not act for the post-master, but for the public. The servant must be employed in the business of the master and for his benefit, or the latter will not be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHNSON, J.

It is decided in England, that the <i>post-master general</i> in England is not liable for his deputies. <i>Lane v. Cotton</i>. 1 <i>Ld.

Goodchild</i>, 2 <i>W. Bl.</i> 906. 3 <i>Wils.</i> 443, the principal question was, whether the post-master was bound to send out the letters to the inhabitants; but a question incidentally arose whether the action, which was brought against the <i>deputy</i> post-master, should not have been brought against the post-master <i>general</i>. The Court, however, was of opinion, that in all cases, deputies are answerable for their own personal misfeasance, such as detaining the letter in question. And in that case the deputies were made, by act of parliament, <i>ex necessitate rei</i>, substantive officers, and their duty pointed out as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the Defendant was liable for the default of his clerks, yet the declaration ought to have shown, whether the Defendant was called upon to account for his own negligence, or that of his clerks. The case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 659, was reluctantly decided upon the authority of <i>Turberville v. Stampe, Ld. Ray.</i> 264, but which does not support the case of <i>Brucker v. Fromont</i>, which is evidently against principle; and at all events is confined to the case of master and servant. In the following cases, a discrimination is made in the declaration between the act of the master, and that of his servants. <i>Turner v. Hawkins</i>, 1 <i>Bos. &amp; Pull.</i> 472. <i>Ogle v. Barnes</i>, 8 <i>T. R.</i> 188. <i>Savignac v. Roome</i>, 6 <i>T. R.</i> 125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumptions arising from circumstantial evidence are always to be left to the jury. Such a positive inference as will justify the Court in directing the jary, that they <i>ought</i> to make it, can arise only from some solemn act. In the present case there was other evidence, showing that no such inference could be drawn as the Plaintiffs had supposed; and therefore the Court did right to leave the whole to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 7th exception required the Court to say, that the Defendant was bound to send on the letter on the 1st of August, or to show a reasonable excuse for not sending it on, although the mail was made up in an irregular manner in Philadelphia. The idea of <i>reasonable diligence</i> is excluded&#8212;and it supposes the Defendant bound at all events to send the letter on by that mail, or to give a sufficient excuse for not doing so, although he sent it by the next mail, and although the loss was not the consequence of not sending it on the 1st of August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendant was not bound to show that he sent it on; it would be impossible in the course of the business of the office to prove the sending on of every particular letter. Sworn officers are presumed to have done their duty, until the contrary is proved. 3 <i>East. Williams v. E. I. Company</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>March</i> 14<i>th. All the Judges being present</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHNSON, J. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows: It is necessary to dissipate the cloud of pleading in which this case is enveloped, in order to form a distinct idea of the questions intended to be brought to the view of the Court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The object is to charge the post-master with the loss of money sent by mail; and the points, which the exceptions are intended to make, are, how far he is liable for his own act or neglect, how far for the acts or neglect of his assistants, and what evidence shall be sufficient to support the Plaintiff's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But unfortunately, as not unfrequently happens in this complex and injudicious mode of conducting a suit, with all the clerical skill displayed by counsel in multiplying their counts and pointing their bills of exceptions, the principal questions are really, at last, not brought to the view of this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first and second exception it is unnecessary to make any remark, as they are admitted to apply to counts which the evidence did not support and have been, in fact, abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third exception is intended to raise the question how far a post-master is liable for the neglect of his assistants; but, connected with the pleadings, it presents another and a very different question, to wit, whether, when the issue is taken upon the neglect of the post-master himself, it is competent to give in evidence, neglect in the assistant acting under him. Now the distinction between the relation of a post-master to his sworn assistant acting under him, and between master and servant generally, has long been settled; and although the latter relation might sanction the admission of such evidence, we are unanimously of opinion that, if it is intended to charge a post-master for the negligence of his assistants, the pleadings must be made up according to the case; and his liability then will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge of their duties in his office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fourth exception, the only difference between the opinion prayed for and that given, is, that the Court require the loss to be a <i>consequence</i> of not forwarding the letter described in the declaration. Now, in justice to the correctness of the Plaintiffs' counsel, this Court hope that they meant nothing more than what the Court conceded; for, certainly, if the loss was not a consequence of the state of things made out in the evidence, they were not entitled to recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fifth exception it is only necessary to remark, that if the Court below erred at all, it was in conceding too much to the prayer of the Plaintiff. An entry on the post-bill is by no means conclusive evidence of the transmission of a letter, for, it may still never have been put into the mail, or may have been stolen in its passage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sixth exception is equally untenable. The instructions of the post-master general spoke for themselves. If the one superseded or rescinded the other, the evidence was to be sought for by comparing them together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the seventh exception affords the Court an opportunity to remark how much more conducive to the purposes of justice it would be to substitute special verdicts, and demurrers to evidence, for the tedious and embarrassing practice of the Court from which this case comes up. It is a fact that this bill of exceptions claims a right of recovery without stating any loss or damage whatever. The opinion prayed for was, that if the jury believed the various facts therein detailed, then it is incumbent on the Defendant to make out a just, reasonable and sufficient excuse for omitting to forward the letter deseribed. But, unless an individual has sustained some loss or damage by an omission of that kind, why should the post-master be held to make out a defence? Each bill of exceptions must be considered as presenting a distinct, substantive case; and it is on the evidence stated in itself alone that the Court is to decide. We cannot go beyond it and collect other facts which must have been in the mind of the party, and the insertion of which in this bill of exceptions could alone have sanctioned the opinion as prayed for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
