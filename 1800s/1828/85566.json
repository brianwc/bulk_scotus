That they established a banking house&#8212;assumed the name and style of the 'President, Directors, and Company of the Saline Bank of Virginia.' That they issued notes, or bills, purporting to be payable out of the joint funds&#8212;to make discounts and exchanges, whereby circulation and currency was given to their notes and bills. That in discharge of public dues, 10, 120 dollars of their notes, were paid into the Treasury of the United States, before the 21st of October 1819; and, on that day, 5,831 dollars, in said notes, were deposited by an agent of the Treasury, with John Webster, Cashier of the said association, who demanded payment therefor, after obtaining a certificate of deposite; which payment was refused by Webster, who said he had no funds.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the agent presented a draft drawn by the Treasurer of the United States, for 4,290 dollars, being also for their notes received in the Treasury, which was the balance of the said sum of 10,120 dollars. This draft was refused also, for want of funds. The bill charges, that Webster possessed funds of the company in specie and notes of solvent chartered banks, and combined with individuals of the company to refuse payment, by fraudulently secreting these funds. The bill prays an account of the funds of the company, and also, to subject the Cashier and stockholders to a personal decree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was filed with the bill, the following documents mentioned therein:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

In such suit, it shall be lawful to make all or any of the members of such company or association, and any officer, agent or manager thereof, parties defendant&#8212;and to call upon and compel them, or either of them, to exhibit all their books and papers, and an account of all such matters and things as may be necessary to enable the Court to make a decree in pursuance of the provisions of this Act. The members of any such association or company, made defendants in such suit, shall be held severally liable to the Commonwealth for their respective proportions of the capital stock held in such company or association, at the institution of such suit, or the time of the decree, or by any person or persons, for his, her or their benefit; and the Court shall decree against the defendants, respectively and severally, the amounts that they and each of them may respectively and severally hold as aforesaid, in the capital stock of such company or association, or by any person or persons for his, her, or their use or benefit, to be levied of the proper goods and chattels, lands and tenements of such defendants: <i>Provided, however</i>, That no disclosure made by any party defendant to such suit in equity, and no books or papers exhibited by him in answer to the bill, or under the order of the Court, shall be used as evidence against him in any motion or prosecution under this law&#8212;and that a recovery in such suit shall be a bar to every motion or prosecution against any defendant to such suit for the recovery of any penalty, or the infliction of any punishment prescribed by this Act.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also 1 <i>Randolph's Rep.</i>, 71 to 101 inclusive.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was submitted to the Court without argument, by the Attorney General of the United States; and by Messrs.
