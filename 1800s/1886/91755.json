A bill of particulars under this paragraph claims, in addition to the $4575, these items: \"Extra expense caused by special castings not fitting, and delay in receiving same, in 20 inch line, $750; 149 wooden valve-boxes, difference between those furnished and those contracted for, at $3, $447.\"</p>\n<p>The defendant demurred to the second paragraph of the complaint, but the demurrer was overruled. It then answered, by a general denial and a plea of payment in full. It also set up a claim of $3000 against the plaintiffs for work done by the defendant which the plaintiffs were bound by the contract to do, but neglected to do.</p>\n<p>As to the second paragraph of the complaint, the answer avers, that, when the contract was executed, it was stated to the plaintiffs, and agreed, that no map or plan of distribution of pipes had been made, but that the defendant's engineer, Cook, would prepare such a map and plan and file it in the office of the trustees or in that of the city engineer; that such map and plan was to be the map and plan referred to in the contract, and was to designate the streets on which the pipes were to be laid, to all of which the plaintiffs then agreed; that Cook prepared a plan and map, and it was filed; that, when the plaintiffs commenced work, they inquired where the pipes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> were to be laid, and the city engineer pointed out to them where the work was to be done, and, at their request, prepared a map and plan showing the manner in which the pipe was to be laid under the river on the line of Clinton street, which the plaintiffs accepted, and which was in accordance with Cook's map and plan; that the plaintiffs then commenced work on Clinton street, in excavating and laying pipes under the river, where it crossed Clinton street, and according to such working plan, without objecting; that it was no more difficult or expensive to lay the pipe under the river on Clinton street than it would have been to lay it under the river where the river crosses Calhoun street; and that any expenditure over $500, was the result of extravagance and unskilfulness.</p>\n<p>As to the third paragraph of the complaint, the answer, in its sixth paragraph, avers that all the materials were furnished, and all the labor was performed, under the written contract, at prices specially set forth therein; that the contract price has been fully paid; and that no written order was made by the city engineer and the trustees, directing the plaintiffs to furnish any extra materials or do any extra work.</p>\n<p>A motion by the plaintiffs to strike out the sixth paragraph of the answer was denied, and then the plaintiffs replied, denying generally the allegations of the answer.</p>\n<p>The case was tried before a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiffs, for $4100, being the amount agreed to be due to the plaintiffs, excluding the three above named items of $4575, $750, and $447, amounting to $5772; and a judgment for $4100, with interest and costs, was entered for the plaintiffs, to review which they have brought this writ of error.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs gave some evidence in support of the three items amounting to $5772, (the defendant introducing no evidence,) but the court declined to allow the plaintiffs to introduce further testimony in support of those items, \"on the ground,\" as the bill of exceptions states, \"that, notwithstanding the location of the crossing of the St. Mary's at Calhoun street, the defendant had a right, under its contract with the plaintiffs, to change the place of crossing to Clinton street, as it did, said contract securing to the defendant that right, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*320</span> that the plaintiffs had no right, under the contract between the parties, to claim anything on account of either of the three items.\" The court also struck out all of the plaintiffs' evidence, except the contract, in support of the three items, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs for $4100. To these rulings and instruction the plaintiffs excepted. This action of the Circuit Court is assigned for error.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the court erred in its view of the rights of the plaintiffs under the contract. The clause providing that no claim for extra work shall be made or entertained, unless such extra work shall have been done in obedience to a written order of the engineer and trustees, is an independent clause from that which provides that the trustees shall have the right to make any alterations in the plan of the work, either before or after its commencement; and the extra work referred to in the former clause does not embrace work done in pursuance of an alteration made by the trustees in the plan. The latter work may be, in one sense, extra work, but if it results from an alteration of plan by the trustees, and there is, in consequence, an increase in the quantity of work, the actual increase is to be paid for, at the \"contract rate for work of its class.\" The extra work referred to in the former clause required the authoritative written order of the engineer and trustees; but, as the trustees had the right to alter the plan, work done to carry out such alteration, when made by the trustees, was authorized by the trustees, in a manner equivalent to a written order by them and the engineer. The change of plan involved in crossing at Clinton street, was authority for the additional cost of crossing there, without a written order.</p>\n<p>The contract states that the work is to be done \"along the lines and in the streets, as indicated on the distribution map.\" The plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that the map which the plaintiffs' agents examined before making the contract did not then show a crossing at Clinton street; that the plaintiffs consequently based their estimates and bid on a crossing at Calhoun street; that the change by the trustees to Clinton street was notified to the plaintiffs on the day on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> which the work on the river was to begin; that the map was subsequently marked with a crossing at Clinton street; and that the increased cost caused by the change was $4575. The contract expressly provides that, if the alteration of the plan increases the quantity of work, the actual increase shall be paid for by the city. The only measure of payment provided for is the \"contract rate for work of its class.\" The price fixed in the contract, of 60 cents per lineal foot for laying 24 inch pipe, such as that used in crossing the river, was based on the obstructions and difficulties to be expected in crossing at Calhoun street, in two feet of water, the general price being based on the laying of the pipe on land, and the expense of crossing the river at Calhoun street being estimated at $500, in the price per lineal foot asked for laying 24 inch pipe. The increase of cost in crossing at Clinton street was $4575. The contract fixes no special rate for laying the pipe under the river, and it cannot fairly be said that there was any contract rate for work of the class of that done in crossing the river in the depth of water, and with the quicksand, found at Clinton street. On the view taken by the defendant, the trustees could have made an alteration of plan requiring that the pipes should traverse a great length of the river, in deep water and quicksand, in crossing it diagonally, and the city could have had all the work done at the general price per lineal foot for laying the pipe. The contract is not capable of such a construction. The actual increase of cost is to be paid for.</p>\n<p>The provision that all loss or damage arising \"from any unforeseen obstructions, or any difficulties that may be encountered in the prosecution of the\" work, \"shall be incurred by the contractor without extra charge\" to the city, cannot fairly apply to the obstructions and difficulties at the changed place of crossing, resulting from the increased depth of water and the quicksand.</p>\n<p>As to the claim for the $750, the \"special castings\" were to be supplied by the defendant from a manufacturer at Fort Wayne, and not by the plaintiffs. They were connections between larger and smaller pipes. The plaintiffs had the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> trenches ready, but the castings, when furnished to them, were defective in size, and expense and delay ensued, in remedying the defects, causing a damage to the plaintiffs, as alleged, of $750. The defendant contends that the clause in the contract which provides that the plaintiffs \"shall have no claim upon the city for any delay in the delivery of pipes or other materials from the manufacturers,\" throws the loss from these defects on the plaintiffs. But we do not so think. The defects were such as could not be detected till the castings were being put in place, and the claim is not for delay in their delivery, within the meaning of the clause referred to. Nor does any work done by the plaintiffs in altering the castings, come under the head of such extra work as required a written order.</p>\n<p>The size of the valve-boxes is not mentioned in the contract, nor their cost. They were, therefore, to be of the usual size and cost. The trustees afterwards required the valve-boxes to be of a size which made them cost $3 more each than those of the usual size would have cost. This was a change of plan, and the increased work caused by it is agreed to be paid for, but there is no contract rate for work of the class. The item of $447 seems to be recoverable.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court, with a direction to award a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",

A bill of particulars under this paragraph claims, in addition to the $4575, these items: \"Extra expense caused by special castings not fitting, and delay in receiving same, in 20 inch line, $750; 149 wooden valve-boxes, difference between those furnished and those contracted for, at $3, $447.\"</p>\n<p>The defendant demurred to the second paragraph of the complaint, but the demurrer was overruled. It then answered, by a general denial and a plea of payment in full. It also set up a claim of $3000 against the plaintiffs for work done by the defendant which the plaintiffs were bound by the contract to do, but neglected to do.</p>\n<p>As to the second paragraph of the complaint, the answer avers, that, when the contract was executed, it was stated to the plaintiffs, and agreed, that no map or plan of distribution of pipes had been made, but that the defendant's engineer, Cook, would prepare such a map and plan and file it in the office of the trustees or in that of the city engineer; that such map and plan was to be the map and plan referred to in the contract, and was to designate the streets on which the pipes were to be laid, to all of which the plaintiffs then agreed; that Cook prepared a plan and map, and it was filed; that, when the plaintiffs commenced work, they inquired where the pipes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> were to be laid, and the city engineer pointed out to them where the work was to be done, and, at their request, prepared a map and plan showing the manner in which the pipe was to be laid under the river on the line of Clinton street, which the plaintiffs accepted, and which was in accordance with Cook's map and plan; that the plaintiffs then commenced work on Clinton street, in excavating and laying pipes under the river, where it crossed Clinton street, and according to such working plan, without objecting; that it was no more difficult or expensive to lay the pipe under the river on Clinton street than it would have been to lay it under the river where the river crosses Calhoun street; and that any expenditure over $500, was the result of extravagance and unskilfulness.</p>\n<p>As to the third paragraph of the complaint, the answer, in its sixth paragraph, avers that all the materials were furnished, and all the labor was performed, under the written contract, at prices specially set forth therein; that the contract price has been fully paid; and that no written order was made by the city engineer and the trustees, directing the plaintiffs to furnish any extra materials or do any extra work.</p>\n<p>A motion by the plaintiffs to strike out the sixth paragraph of the answer was denied, and then the plaintiffs replied, denying generally the allegations of the answer.</p>\n<p>The case was tried before a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiffs, for $4100, being the amount agreed to be due to the plaintiffs, excluding the three above named items of $4575, $750, and $447, amounting to $5772; and a judgment for $4100, with interest and costs, was entered for the plaintiffs, to review which they have brought this writ of error.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs gave some evidence in support of the three items amounting to $5772, (the defendant introducing no evidence,) but the court declined to allow the plaintiffs to introduce further testimony in support of those items, \"on the ground,\" as the bill of exceptions states, \"that, notwithstanding the location of the crossing of the St. Mary's at Calhoun street, the defendant had a right, under its contract with the plaintiffs, to change the place of crossing to Clinton street, as it did, said contract securing to the defendant that right, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*320</span> that the plaintiffs had no right, under the contract between the parties, to claim anything on account of either of the three items.\" The court also struck out all of the plaintiffs' evidence, except the contract, in support of the three items, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs for $4100. To these rulings and instruction the plaintiffs excepted. This action of the Circuit Court is assigned for error.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the court erred in its view of the rights of the plaintiffs under the contract. The clause providing that no claim for extra work shall be made or entertained, unless such extra work shall have been done in obedience to a written order of the engineer and trustees, is an independent clause from that which provides that the trustees shall have the right to make any alterations in the plan of the work, either before or after its commencement; and the extra work referred to in the former clause does not embrace work done in pursuance of an alteration made by the trustees in the plan. The latter work may be, in one sense, extra work, but if it results from an alteration of plan by the trustees, and there is, in consequence, an increase in the quantity of work, the actual increase is to be paid for, at the \"contract rate for work of its class.\" The extra work referred to in the former clause required the authoritative written order of the engineer and trustees; but, as the trustees had the right to alter the plan, work done to carry out such alteration, when made by the trustees, was authorized by the trustees, in a manner equivalent to a written order by them and the engineer. The change of plan involved in crossing at Clinton street, was authority for the additional cost of crossing there, without a written order.</p>\n<p>The contract states that the work is to be done \"along the lines and in the streets, as indicated on the distribution map.\" The plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that the map which the plaintiffs' agents examined before making the contract did not then show a crossing at Clinton street; that the plaintiffs consequently based their estimates and bid on a crossing at Calhoun street; that the change by the trustees to Clinton street was notified to the plaintiffs on the day on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> which the work on the river was to begin; that the map was subsequently marked with a crossing at Clinton street; and that the increased cost caused by the change was $4575. The contract expressly provides that, if the alteration of the plan increases the quantity of work, the actual increase shall be paid for by the city. The only measure of payment provided for is the \"contract rate for work of its class.\" The price fixed in the contract, of 60 cents per lineal foot for laying 24 inch pipe, such as that used in crossing the river, was based on the obstructions and difficulties to be expected in crossing at Calhoun street, in two feet of water, the general price being based on the laying of the pipe on land, and the expense of crossing the river at Calhoun street being estimated at $500, in the price per lineal foot asked for laying 24 inch pipe. The increase of cost in crossing at Clinton street was $4575. The contract fixes no special rate for laying the pipe under the river, and it cannot fairly be said that there was any contract rate for work of the class of that done in crossing the river in the depth of water, and with the quicksand, found at Clinton street. On the view taken by the defendant, the trustees could have made an alteration of plan requiring that the pipes should traverse a great length of the river, in deep water and quicksand, in crossing it diagonally, and the city could have had all the work done at the general price per lineal foot for laying the pipe. The contract is not capable of such a construction. The actual increase of cost is to be paid for.</p>\n<p>The provision that all loss or damage arising \"from any unforeseen obstructions, or any difficulties that may be encountered in the prosecution of the\" work, \"shall be incurred by the contractor without extra charge\" to the city, cannot fairly apply to the obstructions and difficulties at the changed place of crossing, resulting from the increased depth of water and the quicksand.</p>\n<p>As to the claim for the $750, the \"special castings\" were to be supplied by the defendant from a manufacturer at Fort Wayne, and not by the plaintiffs. They were connections between larger and smaller pipes. The plaintiffs had the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> trenches ready, but the castings, when furnished to them, were defective in size, and expense and delay ensued, in remedying the defects, causing a damage to the plaintiffs, as alleged, of $750. The defendant contends that the clause in the contract which provides that the plaintiffs \"shall have no claim upon the city for any delay in the delivery of pipes or other materials from the manufacturers,\" throws the loss from these defects on the plaintiffs. But we do not so think. The defects were such as could not be detected till the castings were being put in place, and the claim is not for delay in their delivery, within the meaning of the clause referred to. Nor does any work done by the plaintiffs in altering the castings, come under the head of such extra work as required a written order.</p>\n<p>The size of the valve-boxes is not mentioned in the contract, nor their cost. They were, therefore, to be of the usual size and cost. The trustees afterwards required the valve-boxes to be of a size which made them cost $3 more each than those of the usual size would have cost. This was a change of plan, and the increased work caused by it is agreed to be paid for, but there is no contract rate for work of the class. The item of $447 seems to be recoverable.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court, with a direction to award a new trial.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",

The contract expressly provides that if the alteration of the plan increases the quantity of work, the actual increase shall be paid for by the city. The only measure of payment provided for is the 'contract rate for work of its class.' The price fixed in the contract, of 60 cents per lineal foot for laying 24-inch pipe, such as that used in crossing the river, was based on the obstructions and difficulties to be expected in crossing at Calhoun street, in two feet of water; the general price being based on the laying of the pipe on land, and the expense of crossing the river at Calhoun street being estimated at $500, in the price per lineal foot asked for laying 24-inch pipe. The increase of cost in crossing at Clinton street was $4,575. The contract fixes no special rate for laying the pipe under the river, and it cannot fairly be said that there was any contract rate for work of the class of that done in crossing the river in the depth of water, and with the quicksand, found at Clinton street. On the view taken by the defendant, the trustees could have made an alteration of plan requiring that the pipes should traverse a great length of the river, in deep water and quicksand, in crossing it diagonally, and the city could have had all the work done at the general price per lineal foot for laying the pipe. The contract is not capable of such a construction. The actual increase of cost is to be paid for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision that all loss or damage arising 'from any unforeseen obstructions, or any difficulties that may be encountered in the prosecution of the' work, 'shall be incurred by the contractor without extra charge' to the city, cannot fairly apply to the obstructions and difficulties at the changed place of crossing, resulting from the increased depth of water and the quicksand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the claim for the $750, the 'special castings' were to be supplied by the defendant from a manufacturer at Fort Wayne, and not by the plaintiffs. They were connections between larger and smaller pipes. The plaintiffs had the trenches ready, but the castings, when furnished to them, were defective in size, and expense and delay ensued, in remedying the defects, causing a damage to the plaintiffs, as alleged, of $750. The defendant contends that the clause in the contract which provides that the plaintiffs 'shall have no claim upon the city for any delay in the delivery of pipes or other materials from the manufacturers,' throws the loss from these defects on the plaintiffs. But we do not so think. The defects were such as could not be detected till the castings were being put in place, and the claim is not for delay in their delivery, within the meaning of the clause referred to. Nor does any work done by the plaintiffs in altering the castings come under the head of such extra work as required a written order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The size of the valve-boxes is not mentioned in the contract, nor their cost. They were, therefore, to be of the usual size and cost. The trustees afterwards required the valve-boxes to be of a size which made them cost $3 more each than those of the usual size would have cost. This was a change of plan, and the increased work caused by it is agreed to be paid for, but there is no contract rate for work of the class. The item of $447 seems to be recoverable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court, with a direction to award a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
