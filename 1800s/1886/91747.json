It does appear that the defendant was, at the commencement of the suit, a citizen of Connecticut, and that the intestate, Maris Rhoads, was, at the time of his death, a citizen of Pennsylvania, but there is nothing to show the citizenship of the plaintiff, and the jurisdiction depends on her citizenship, and not on that of her intestate. <i>Amory</i> v. <i>Amory</i>, 95 U.

It may be that by the law of Pennsylvania the personal representative of a deceased citizen of Pennsylvania is, in contemplation of law, resident within the state, and at all times amenable to the jurisdiction of the proper courts of that state, but that does not necessarily imply citizenship of the state. He must be there for the purposes of his administration, but that is all; and, besides, the jurisdiction must appear positively.
