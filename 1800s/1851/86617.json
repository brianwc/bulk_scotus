That the first supplementary article of the treaty does not make a grant or reservation in favor of the Grappes of four leagues of land, but the true meaning and import is simply that the Grappes shall have <i>their right</i>, whatever it may be, to the four leagues of land stated as being reserved to them in 1801, in the preamble; and there was, therefore, error in the refusal of the court to give the first instruction prayed for.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, it is contended, is the true construction. The language of the second supplementary article, relating to the donation to Edwards, is very different in its terms, and imports a present grant. 'There <i>shall be reserved</i> to Larkin Edwards, &amp;c., one section of land.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. That the recital of the reservation to the Grappes, in 1801 does not relieve the defendants from producing the primordial title on which they must rely, and the court, therefore, erred in refusing to give the second instruction prayed for, and in charging as it did on this point under the second head of the charge as given.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of Louisiana, borrowed from the civil law, is against the court below. The 2251st article of the Code declares that 'recognitive acts do not dispense with the exhibition of the primordial title, unless its tenor be there specially set forth.' In this case its tenor is not set forth, and the primordial title must therefore be produced. The recognitive act is no proof of the contents of the primordial, even when the latter is fully set forth, unless it also be shown that the latter is lost. 1 Evans's Pothier, &#167;&#167; 742, 743, p. 443; <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Norris</i>, 6 Rob. (La.), 181.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But had the Spanish authorities in 1801 any power to authorize and sanction the reservation? That they had no such power has been decided many times in this court, in the case of the Perdido boundary. The country embraced within the limits of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi, stretched far beyond even the Sabine, and it was not until the treaty with Spain of 1819, that the United States relinquished their claim to it, and ceded what lay west of that river to Spain. The United States claimed it from the first. In the act of 20th February, 1811 (2 Stat. at L., 641), to authorize the people of the Territory of Orleans to form a state government, the Sabine is declared to be the western boundary of the new state. Besides, it is to be remembered, that the fourteenth section of the act of 26th March, 1804 (2 Stat. at L., 287), declares that all grants, and every act and proceeding subsequent to the treaty of St. Ildefonso, of whatsoever nature, towards the obtaining of any grant, title, or claim to land in Louisiana, under whatsoever authority transacted or presented, shall be null and void.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to all that, it may here be mentioned that the Caddoes themselves never claimed Rush Island, or ever used it in any way. It was occupied by whites, and was never intended by the Caddoes to be included in the treaty or given to the Grappes.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. That by the law of Spain the Caddo Indians had no primitive title to any land, and had no power to alienate without consent of the Spanish authorities; and these authorities at Natchitoches had no right to sanction the donation mentioned in the preamble and supplementary article. <i>Mitchel et al.</i> v. <i>The United States</i>, 9 Pet., 714. The Spanish officers at Natchitoches had no control over the Caddoes, the territory they inhabited being within the jurisdiction of the post of Nacogdoches. See 2 Martin's History of Louisiana, 202, 203, 261, 262; see also House Doc. No. 49, 1st Session, 24th Congress.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. That there was error in the court refusing to give the fourth instruction prayed for, because the matters therein mentioned were part of the history and public archives of the country, on which it was the duty of the court to inform the jury. See the state papers above referred to.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. That the court erred in refusing to give the fifth instruction prayed for, and in charging as in the third point of the charge given.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. That if there is no title in Brooks, there can be none in the purchasers under him.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VII. That the court erred in not admitting as evidence in the cause the letter of General Cass to Mr. Garland, of the 17th of March, 1836, and the memorial of the Caddoes to the Senate of the United States, of the 19th of September, 1837, and the report of the House and depositions therein, and in the case of <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Norris</i>; and in admitting copies of the affidavits of David, Trichel, and D'Ortlont.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Walker's</i> points were as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Defendants' title rests upon a grant by treaty to the Grappes, a <i>bona fide</i> sale by them to Jehiel Brooks, and a <i>bona fide</i> sale of part of the land by him to the other defendants. The treaty of 1st July, 1835, being ratified and confirmed by the President and Senate, becomes the supreme law, and cannot be set aside by the courts, on any ground whatever, not even upon an allegation of fraud. Const. U. S., art. 6, &#167; 2; Story on Const., 684, 686; <i>Foster &amp; Elam</i> v. <i>Neilson</i>, 2 Pet., 254, 306, 307; 6 Id., 711, 738; 3 Peters Dig., 654, 655, Nos. 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12; 1 Kent, 286, 287; 6 Cranch, 136, 139.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The boundaries of the Indian lands ceded to the United States by the treaty are fixed therein, and cannot now be disputed by either party thereto, nor can they be altered but by the consent of both parties; the right of the Indians to the lands ceded is admitted by the treaty, and by the general policy of the government in treating with them. Story on Const., 379 <i>et seq.</i>, &#167;&#167; 532, 535; 12 Pet., 516, 725; 14 Id., 13, 14.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The boundaries cannot be varied by parol proof, because,&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. The United States are parties to the treaty, which is in writing, and cannot be varied or contradicted by them. 2 Peters Dig., 234 <i>et seq.</i>, Nos. 898, 903, 904, 909, 921, 922, 933.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. The treaty is part of the supreme law of the land, and cannot be varied or contradicted by parol proof. 2 Peters Dig., 153, No. 35; 161, No. 128; 172, No. 238.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The treaty, by its terms, declared that the Caddo Indians had previously donated the lands in dispute to the Grappes, the defendants' vendors, and confirmed that donation to them; which treaty having the force of a law, it is equal in dignity and effect to a complete grant by the United States, and they cannot go beyond that grant. 9 Pet., 746; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>McIntosh</i>, 8 Wheat., 571; 6 Pet., 342; 2 Hows., 344.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The motives that induced the President and Senate to ratify the treaty containing this grant, or the reasons, if any, that should have influenced them to reject that part of the treaty, are not proper subjects of inquiry in any court, but all such acts must be received as conclusive on all subjects within the scope of their power. 6 Cranch, 129, 131; Story on Const., 567.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. Congress cannot, by legislation in any form, divest a citizen of rights acquired under a treaty, or previous act of Congress. 6 Cranch, 132, 133, 135.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. Brooks is a <i>bon a fide</i> purchaser from the Grappes, who acquired a good legal title under the treaty, which title cannot be questioned by the grantors of his vendors. 6 Cranch, 133, 134; Story on Const., 567.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Fraud cannot be charged on Brooks, as United States commissioner, in negotiating the treaty, without charing the same on the President and Senate, for he was their agent, and they made his act their own by their confirmation of the treaty. Story on Const., 557.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. Congress have not authorized the inquiry of <i>fraud</i> to be made, but expunged it from the House resolutions, 38. Resolution of Congress, 30th August, 1842 (5 Stat. at L., 584.)</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. The fact of Brooks having been commissioner to negotiate the treaty did not disqualify him from purchasing long afterwards, and when his functions had ceased, land reserved in said treaty, and such purchase is no evidence of fraud in negotiating the treaty. 2 Peters Dig., 357; 3 Wash. C. C., 556 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. The question of fraud was, however, submitted by the court to the jury, and decided in favor of the defendants, as appears by the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12. Report of commissioners, Doc. 1035, and record of <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Norris</i>, not admissible. 1st. The depositions not taken in any suit nor in any issue joined before any judicial tribunal, nor any other tribunal having power to try or decide title to property. 1 Phil. Ev., 14 (and note 42), 378, 394, and 395; Const. U. S., art. 1, &#167; 1; art. 2, &#167; 1; art. 3, &#167;&#167; 1 and 2; 2 Peters Dig., 164, No. 153. 2d. Consent to read the testimony in <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Norris</i> does not bind the parties to admit the testimony in this suit, which is between different parties, both plaintiff and defendants. 10 Mart.

The French, and afterwards the Spaniards, always treated us as friends and brothers. No white man ever settled on our lands, and we were assured they never should. We were told the same things by the Americans in our first council at Natchitoches, and that we could not sell our lands to any body but our great father the President. Our two last agents, Captain Grey and Colonel Brooks, have driven a great many bad white people off from our lands; but now our last-named agent tells us that he is no longer our agent, and that we no longer have a gunsmith or blacksmith, and says he does not know what will be done with us or for us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This heavy news has put us in great trouble. We have held a great council, and finally come to the sorrowful resolution of offering all our lands to you, which lie within the boundary of the United States, for sale, at such price as we can agree on in council one with the other. These lands are bounded on one side by the Red River, on another side by Bayou Pascagoula, Bayou and Lake Wallace, and the Bayou Cypress; and on the other side by Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We have never consented to any reservation but one, to be taken out of these lands, and that was made a great many years ago.

We went with our friend and brother Touline (otherwise Grappe) before the Spanish authority, and saw it put down in writing, and gave our consent in writing, and the Spanish authority ratified our gift in writing. But, before the Americans came, our brother's house was burned, and the writings we have mentioned were consumed in it. Touline (otherwise Grappe) was a half-blood Caddo; his father was a Frenchman, and had done good things for his son when a boy. When he grew to be a man, he returned among us, and continued near to us till he died. He was always our greatest counsellor for good. He was our French, Spanish, and American interpreter, for a great many years; our brother now is dead, but his sons live.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We, therefore, the chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation, pray that the United States will guarantee to the sons now living of our good brother, deceased, Touline (otherwise Grappe), the whole of our original gift,&#8212;four leagues to him and to them; and your memorialists further pray, that your Excellency will take speedy measures to treat with us for the purchase of the residue of our lands, as above described, so that we may obtain some relief from our pressing necessities; and your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This letter was signed by twenty-four chiefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the back of this memorial, the President made the following indorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The President incloses to the Secretary of War the memorial of the Caddo chiefs, for his consideration, whether it will not be proper to appoint a commissioner, to obtain a complete cession of their lands to the United States.

The said chiefs, head men, and warriors would further represent unto your honorable body, that Jehiel Brooks told one of the chiefs that one Jacques Grappe requested him to ask the Indians for a piece of land on Red River, in the bottom and on the east side of the Bayou Pierre (the western water of Red River); that the said chief told Mr. Brooks that it was not their land, and Mr. Brooks told him that it was their land.

That the first of the supplementary articles to the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians, made at the agency-house of the Caddo nation on the 1st of July, 1835, does not amount in law to a grant of four leagues of land from the United States to Francois Grappe and his sons, nor does it amount in law to a reservation then made of said lands to the said Grappes, but it is simply a reservation of whatever right the said Grappes may have acquired to said land by the donation mentioned in the preamble to the supplementary articles to the said treaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Second.

The French, and afterwards the Spaniards, always treated us as friends and brothers. No white man ever settled on our lands, and we were assured they never should. We were told the same things by the Americans in our first council at Natchitoches, and that we could not sell our lands to any body but our great father the President. Our two last agents, Captain Grey and Colonel Brooks, have driven a great many bad white people off from our lands; but now our last-named agent tells us that be is no longer our agent, and that we no longer have a gunsmith or blacksmith, and says he does not know what will be done with us or for us.</p>\n<p>\"This heavy news has put us in great trouble. We have held a great council, and finally come to the sorrowful resolution of offering all our lands to you, which lie within the boundary of the United States, for sale, at such price as we can agree on in council one with the other. These lands are bounded on one side by the Red River, on another side by Bayou Pascagoula, Bayou and Lake Wallace, and the Bayou Cypress; and on the other side by Texas.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> \"We have never consented to any reservation but one, to be taken out of these lands, and that was made a great many years ago. The Caddo nation then gave to their greatest and best friend, called by them Touline, but known to all the white people by the name of François Grappe, and to his three sons then born, one league of land each, which was to be laid off, commencing at the lowest corner of our lands on the Red River, (as above described,) and running up the river four leagues, and one league from that line back, so as to make four leagues of land. We went with our friend and brother Touline (otherwise Grappe) before the Spanish authority, and saw it put down in writing, and gave our consent in writing, and the Spanish authority ratified our gift in writing. But, before the Americans came, our brother's house was burned, and the writings we have mentioned were consumed in it. Touline (otherwise Grappe) was a half-blood Caddo; his father was a Frenchman, and had done good things for his son when a boy. When he grew to be a man, he returned among us, and continued near to us till he died. He was always our greatest counsellor for good. He was our French, Spanish, and American interpreter, for a great many years; our brother now is dead, but his sons live.</p>\n<p>\"We, therefore, the chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation, pray that the United States will guarantee to the sons now living of our good brother, deceased, Touline (otherwise Grappe), the whole of our original gift,  four leagues to him and to them; and your memorialists further pray, that your Excellency will take speedy measures to treat with us for the purchase of the residue of our lands, as above described, so that we may obtain some relief from our pressing necessities; and your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray,\" &amp;c.</p>\n<p>This letter was signed by twenty-four chiefs.</p>\n<p>Upon the back of this memorial, the President made the following indorsement.</p>\n<p>\"The President incloses to the Secretary of War the memorial of the Caddo chiefs, for his consideration, whether it will not be proper to appoint a commissioner, to obtain a complete cession of their lands to the United States.

These circumstances are mentioned here, because they are referred to in the bills of exceptions. The memorialists alleged that Rush Island had never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and was fraudulently included in the treaty.

The said chiefs, head men, and warriors would further represent unto your honorable body, that Jehiel Brooks told one of the chiefs that one Jacques Grappe requested him to ask the Indians for a piece of land on Red River, in the bottom and on the east side of the Bayou Pierre (the western water of Red River); that the said chief told Mr. Brooks that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> it was not their land, and Mr. Brooks told him that it was their land. The chief then told Mr. Brooks that, if it was their land, he was willing to give Jacques Grappe a little piece; but that they never made any reserve to François Grappe, or any of his heirs or representatives, by the treaty, within the limits of land they claimed or sold to the United States.</p>\n<p>\"In witness of the truth of the above statement the said chiefs, head men, and warriors have hereunto set their hands, the day of the date above.\"</p>\n<p>On the 22d of May, 1838, a committee of the Senate reported that Rush Island never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and recommended a confirmation of the titles of certain settlers who were living on it anterior to the treaty between the United States and Caddoes.</p>\n<p>In 1840, memorials were again presented to Congress by these last-mentioned settlers, and much testimony was taken by the authority of Mr. Bell, chairman of the committee to whom the memorials were referred.</p>\n<p>In April, 1842, a committee of the House of Representatives reported in favor of confirming the titles of these settlers, and on the 6th of July, 1842, an act of Congress was passed confirming them.

Downs the District Attorney of the United States, filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana against the parties named in this report, alleging that they had unlawfully and fraudulently taken possession of the land therein described. The claim of the United States is thus set forth in the petition: </p>\n<p>\"Petitioners allege, that they are the true and lawful owners of the above-described land and premises, and that the pretended claim of the said possessors is illegal, invalid, and fraudulent; that by the treaty of cession of the province of Louisiana by the French Republic to the United States of America, and by the treaty between Spain and the United States of America in 1819, the United States succeeded to all the rights of France and Spain, as they then were in and over said province, including all lands which were not private property, and that the aforesaid tract of land, ever since the said treaties, remained vested in the said plaintiffs, who are now the true and legal owners of the same; that plaintiffs have suffered damage to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, by the disturbance and occupation of said land by said possessors.\"</p>\n<p>On the 18th of March, 1846, Brooks answered the petition. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> He set forth the treaty, its ratification and proclamation; alleged that the heirs of Grappe acquired a perfect title under the reservation which he had since purchased, and that under the joint resolution of Congress the District Attorney of the United States was not authorized to allege fraud against him as commissioner; that he had sold and delivered sundry parts of the land to other persons, who were also defendants.</p>\n<p>On the 13th of April, 1846, the District Attorney of the United States filed the following notice to the defendants of certain evidence which he proposed to offer upon the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\"UNITED STATES v.

JEHIEL BROOKS.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\"United States Circuit Court, District of Louisiana.</h2>\n<p>\"Be it remembered, that on the 13th of April, 1846, a rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> was taken in this cause by the plaintiffs, calling on the defendants to show cause on the 17th of the same month why the depositions of certain witnesses named in said rule, and taken as therein stated, should not be read in evidence in this cause, when the same shall come on to be tried, as appears in said rule, which is hereunto annexed, and made a part of this bill of exceptions; and on the said 17th of April, 1846, Jehiel Brooks, by his counsel, Thomas H. Lewis, appeared and showed cause against the said rule, and contended that the said rule ought to be dismissed and discharged on the following grounds: </p>\n<p>\"1st. The court cannot entertain this rule at the present stage of the suit, because the only law authorizing such a rule is an act of the legislature of the State of Louisiana, entitled `An Act to amend the Code of Practice,' approved March 20, 1839, (see Acts 1839, page 168, section 17,) and said act does not apply to the present case, but is only applicable to depositions taken under commissions issued by the court, and in the suit in which such depositions are offered as evidence.</p>\n<p>\"2d. The court cannot be called upon to decide upon the admissibility of any evidence in a cause before the same shall come on for trial, except in the case pointed out in said act of 20th March, 1839, and these depositions do not fall within the exception provided for by that act.</p>\n<p>\"3d. These depositions were not taken in any action or suit pending before any judicial tribunal, or by authority of any tribunal having power to decide upon title to property, or to bind parties litigant by its decisions.</p>\n<p>\"4th. There is no evidence before the court of any such suit as that of Jehiel Brooks v. Samuel Norris, or that these depositions were read in evidence, by consent or otherwise, on the trial of such suit, and these facts are not admitted.</p>\n<p>\"5th. If such a suit as Brooks v. Norris did exist, and if said depositions were read in evidence on the trial thereof, still they are not admissible in this cause, because the parties to this suit are not the same as the parties to that of Brooks v. Norris.</p>\n<p>\"Which grounds of objection being sustained by the court, the counsel for plaintiffs tendered this bill of exceptions, which was signed and sealed.</p>\n    (Signed,)                      THEO.

JEHIEL BROOKS ET AL.</h2>\n<p>\"In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fifth Circuit and District of Louisiana, Hon. T.H. McCaleb, Judge of the District Court, alone presiding; April term, 1848.</p>\n<p>\"Be it remembered, that on the trial of this case, on the 5th day of May, 1848, after the arguments of counsel on both sides had been closed, and before the jury had retired to consider on their verdict, the attorney of the United States prayed the court to charge the jury as follows, to wit: </p>\n<p>\"First. That the first of the supplementary articles to the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians, made at the agency-house of the Caddo nation on the 1st of July, 1835, does not amount in law to a grant of four leagues of land from the United States to François Grappe and his sons, nor does it amount in law to a reservation then made of said lands to the said Grappes, but it is simply a reservation of whatever right the said Grappes may have acquired to said land by the donation mentioned in the preamble to the supplementary articles to the said treaty.</p>\n<p>\"Second. That the recital in the said preamble and supplementary articles, of a donation to the Grappes in 1801, does <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> not relieve the defendants from the necessity of producing the primordial title or donation of 1801, nor does said recital prove the existence of said donation.</p>\n<p>\"Third. That by the laws of Spain, which governed the locus in quo in 1801, the Indians had no primitive title to any land on this continent; and that in 1801 the Spanish authority at Natchitoches had no legal right to ratify and confirm the donation recited in the aforesaid preamble and supplementary articles.</p>\n<p>\"Fourth. That, by the laws and usages of the government of the United States, the Caddo Indians did not hold their land by the usual Indian title, but that they had been merely permitted to live upon it.</p>\n<p>\"Fifth. That the legal construction of the Caddo treaty of the 1st of July, 1838, is, that those Indians merely relinquished to the United States their permissive possession of the lands.</p>\n<p>\"Sixth. That, as all the other defendants, besides Brooks, are his vendees, and hold title under him, if the jury think from the evidence that Brooks has no title to the land, then that the other defendants stand in the same category, and are also without title.</p>\n<p>\"But the court refused so to charge the jury, and did charge them as follows: </p>\n<p>\"First. That the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians on the 1st of July, 1835, and the articles supplementary thereto, having been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States, is part of the supreme law of the land, and as such must be respected and enforced by the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p>\"Second. That the first supplementary article to the said treaty, and the preamble thereof, contain a recognition of title in François Grappe and his three sons to the land described in said preamble and article, and dispensed them, and those who hold under them, from producing any other title to said lands.</p>\n<p>\"Third. That the United States, by treating with the Caddo Indians for the purchase of their lands, recognized in said Indians a right to said lands, similar to the rights to lands generally recognized in Indian tribes with whom the United States have made treaties.</p>\n<p>Fourth. That the testimony offered on behalf of the United States, to prove the lands reserved by the treaty in question to the Grappes had been fraudulently included within the limits of the territory ceded to the United States by the Caddo Indians, by the defendant, Jehiel Brooks, while acting as commissioner of the United States in making said treaty, was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> properly admitted to be read to the jury, and they should consider the same; and if they found said Brooks guilty of fraud, they should find a verdict for plaintiffs against said Brooks.</p>\n<p>\"Fifth. That the other defendants stood in a different light before the court from Brooks, and the jury should inquire (if they found fraud in Brooks) whether said defendants had notice or knowledge of such fraud when they purchased the land held by them; and if the jury believed, from the evidence, that these other defendants (purchasers from Brooks) had notice or knowledge of such fraud, they should find also against them. But if, on the contrary, these purchasers had no such knowledge or notice, then the fraud in Brooks, their vendor, would not affect their title.</p>\n<p>\"Whereupon the attorney of the United States for the District of Louisiana excepted to the said refusal and charge, and tenders this as his bill of exceptions, which he prays may be signed and made part of the record.</p>\n     (Signed,)                     THEO. H. McCALEB, U.S. Judge.\"\n<p>A writ of error, sued out on behalf of the United States, brought these several rulings before this court.</p>\n<p>Such is the history of this transaction before and since it was brought into court by the United States.</p>\n<p>All of us concur in opinion, that no exception was taken by the counsel of the United States to the rulings of the District Court in this cause, which can be sustained here.</p>\n<p>We think that the treaty gave to the Grappes a fee simple title to all the rights which the Caddoes had in these lands, as fully as any patent from the government could make one. The reservation to the Grappes, \"their heirs and assigns for ever,\" creates as absolute a fee as any subsequent act upon the part of the United States could make. Nothing further was contemplated by the treaty to perfect the title.</p>\n<p>Brooks being the alienee of the Grappes for the entire reservation, he may hold it against any claim of the United States, as his alienors would have done.</p>\n<p>We have nothing to do, in our consideration of the case, with the conjectural intimations, which were made in the argument of it, concerning the influences which were used to secure the reservation, or the designs of the commissioner in having it done. The record shows that he became a purchaser for a valuable consideration. Whether for an adequate one is not for us to say. His right to the land against the claim of the United States, as that has been asserted in this case, we think good, and we shall direct the judgment of the court below to be affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel.

The French, and afterwards the Spaniards, always treated us as friends and brothers. No white man ever settled on our lands, and we were assured they never should. We were told the same things by the Americans in our first council at Natchitoches, and that we could not sell our lands to any body but our great father the President. Our two last agents, Captain Grey and Colonel Brooks, have driven a great many bad white people off from our lands; but now our last-named agent tells us that be is no longer our agent, and that we no longer have a gunsmith or blacksmith, and says he does not know what will be done with us or for us.</p>\n<p>\"This heavy news has put us in great trouble. We have held a great council, and finally come to the sorrowful resolution of offering all our lands to you, which lie within the boundary of the United States, for sale, at such price as we can agree on in council one with the other. These lands are bounded on one side by the Red River, on another side by Bayou Pascagoula, Bayou and Lake Wallace, and the Bayou Cypress; and on the other side by Texas.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> \"We have never consented to any reservation but one, to be taken out of these lands, and that was made a great many years ago. The Caddo nation then gave to their greatest and best friend, called by them Touline, but known to all the white people by the name of François Grappe, and to his three sons then born, one league of land each, which was to be laid off, commencing at the lowest corner of our lands on the Red River, (as above described,) and running up the river four leagues, and one league from that line back, so as to make four leagues of land. We went with our friend and brother Touline (otherwise Grappe) before the Spanish authority, and saw it put down in writing, and gave our consent in writing, and the Spanish authority ratified our gift in writing. But, before the Americans came, our brother's house was burned, and the writings we have mentioned were consumed in it. Touline (otherwise Grappe) was a half-blood Caddo; his father was a Frenchman, and had done good things for his son when a boy. When he grew to be a man, he returned among us, and continued near to us till he died. He was always our greatest counsellor for good. He was our French, Spanish, and American interpreter, for a great many years; our brother now is dead, but his sons live.</p>\n<p>\"We, therefore, the chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation, pray that the United States will guarantee to the sons now living of our good brother, deceased, Touline (otherwise Grappe), the whole of our original gift,  four leagues to him and to them; and your memorialists further pray, that your Excellency will take speedy measures to treat with us for the purchase of the residue of our lands, as above described, so that we may obtain some relief from our pressing necessities; and your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray,\" &amp;c.</p>\n<p>This letter was signed by twenty-four chiefs.</p>\n<p>Upon the back of this memorial, the President made the following indorsement.</p>\n<p>\"The President incloses to the Secretary of War the memorial of the Caddo chiefs, for his consideration, whether it will not be proper to appoint a commissioner, to obtain a complete cession of their lands to the United States. There will be about half a million of acres, it is supposed.

The memorialists alleged that Rush Island had never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and was fraudulently included in the treaty.

The said chiefs, head men, and warriors would further represent unto your honorable body, that Jehiel Brooks told one of the chiefs that one Jacques Grappe requested him to ask the Indians for a piece of land on Red River, in the bottom and on the east side of the Bayou Pierre (the western water of Red River); that the said chief told Mr. Brooks that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> it was not their land, and Mr. Brooks told him that it was their land. The chief then told Mr. Brooks that, if it was their land, he was willing to give Jacques Grappe a little piece; but that they never made any reserve to François Grappe, or any of his heirs or representatives, by the treaty, within the limits of land they claimed or sold to the United States.</p>\n<p>\"In witness of the truth of the above statement the said chiefs, head men, and warriors have hereunto set their hands, the day of the date above.\"</p>\n<p>On the 22d of May, 1838, a committee of the Senate reported that Rush Island never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and recommended a confirmation of the titles of certain settlers who were living on it anterior to the treaty between the United States and Caddoes.</p>\n<p>In 1840, memorials were again presented to Congress by these last-mentioned settlers, and much testimony was taken by the authority of Mr. Bell, chairman of the committee to whom the memorials were referred.</p>\n<p>In April, 1842, a committee of the House of Representatives reported in favor of confirming the titles of these settlers, and on the 6th of July, 1842, an act of Congress was passed confirming them.

The claim of the United States is thus set forth in the petition: </p>\n<p>\"Petitioners allege, that they are the true and lawful owners of the above-described land and premises, and that the pretended claim of the said possessors is illegal, invalid, and fraudulent; that by the treaty of cession of the province of Louisiana by the French Republic to the United States of America, and by the treaty between Spain and the United States of America in 1819, the United States succeeded to all the rights of France and Spain, as they then were in and over said province, including all lands which were not private property, and that the aforesaid tract of land, ever since the said treaties, remained vested in the said plaintiffs, who are now the true and legal owners of the same; that plaintiffs have suffered damage to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, by the disturbance and occupation of said land by said possessors.\"</p>\n<p>On the 18th of March, 1846, Brooks answered the petition. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> He set forth the treaty, its ratification and proclamation; alleged that the heirs of Grappe acquired a perfect title under the reservation which he had since purchased, and that under the joint resolution of Congress the District Attorney of the United States was not authorized to allege fraud against him as commissioner; that he had sold and delivered sundry parts of the land to other persons, who were also defendants.</p>\n<p>On the 13th of April, 1846, the District Attorney of the United States filed the following notice to the defendants of certain evidence which he proposed to offer upon the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\"UNITED STATES v.

Lewis, appeared and showed cause against the said rule, and contended that the said rule ought to be dismissed and discharged on the following grounds: </p>\n<p>\"1st. The court cannot entertain this rule at the present stage of the suit, because the only law authorizing such a rule is an act of the legislature of the State of Louisiana, entitled `An Act to amend the Code of Practice,' approved March 20, 1839, (see Acts 1839, page 168, section 17,) and said act does not apply to the present case, but is only applicable to depositions taken under commissions issued by the court, and in the suit in which such depositions are offered as evidence.</p>\n<p>\"2d. The court cannot be called upon to decide upon the admissibility of any evidence in a cause before the same shall come on for trial, except in the case pointed out in said act of 20th March, 1839, and these depositions do not fall within the exception provided for by that act.</p>\n<p>\"3d. These depositions were not taken in any action or suit pending before any judicial tribunal, or by authority of any tribunal having power to decide upon title to property, or to bind parties litigant by its decisions.</p>\n<p>\"4th. There is no evidence before the court of any such suit as that of Jehiel Brooks v. Samuel Norris, or that these depositions were read in evidence, by consent or otherwise, on the trial of such suit, and these facts are not admitted.</p>\n<p>\"5th. If such a suit as Brooks v. Norris did exist, and if said depositions were read in evidence on the trial thereof, still they are not admissible in this cause, because the parties to this suit are not the same as the parties to that of Brooks v. Norris.</p>\n<p>\"Which grounds of objection being sustained by the court, the counsel for plaintiffs tendered this bill of exceptions, which was signed and sealed.</p>\n    (Signed,)                      THEO.

That the first of the supplementary articles to the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians, made at the agency-house of the Caddo nation on the 1st of July, 1835, does not amount in law to a grant of four leagues of land from the United States to François Grappe and his sons, nor does it amount in law to a reservation then made of said lands to the said Grappes, but it is simply a reservation of whatever right the said Grappes may have acquired to said land by the donation mentioned in the preamble to the supplementary articles to the said treaty.</p>\n<p>\"Second. That the recital in the said preamble and supplementary articles, of a donation to the Grappes in 1801, does <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> not relieve the defendants from the necessity of producing the primordial title or donation of 1801, nor does said recital prove the existence of said donation.</p>\n<p>\"Third. That by the laws of Spain, which governed the locus in quo in 1801, the Indians had no primitive title to any land on this continent; and that in 1801 the Spanish authority at Natchitoches had no legal right to ratify and confirm the donation recited in the aforesaid preamble and supplementary articles.</p>\n<p>\"Fourth. That, by the laws and usages of the government of the United States, the Caddo Indians did not hold their land by the usual Indian title, but that they had been merely permitted to live upon it.</p>\n<p>\"Fifth. That the legal construction of the Caddo treaty of the 1st of July, 1838, is, that those Indians merely relinquished to the United States their permissive possession of the lands.</p>\n<p>\"Sixth. That, as all the other defendants, besides Brooks, are his vendees, and hold title under him, if the jury think from the evidence that Brooks has no title to the land, then that the other defendants stand in the same category, and are also without title.</p>\n<p>\"But the court refused so to charge the jury, and did charge them as follows: </p>\n<p>\"First. That the treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians on the 1st of July, 1835, and the articles supplementary thereto, having been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States, is part of the supreme law of the land, and as such must be respected and enforced by the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p>\"Second. That the first supplementary article to the said treaty, and the preamble thereof, contain a recognition of title in François Grappe and his three sons to the land described in said preamble and article, and dispensed them, and those who hold under them, from producing any other title to said lands.</p>\n<p>\"Third. That the United States, by treating with the Caddo Indians for the purchase of their lands, recognized in said Indians a right to said lands, similar to the rights to lands generally recognized in Indian tribes with whom the United States have made treaties.</p>\n<p>Fourth. That the testimony offered on behalf of the United States, to prove the lands reserved by the treaty in question to the Grappes had been fraudulently included within the limits of the territory ceded to the United States by the Caddo Indians, by the defendant, Jehiel Brooks, while acting as commissioner of the United States in making said treaty, was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> properly admitted to be read to the jury, and they should consider the same; and if they found said Brooks guilty of fraud, they should find a verdict for plaintiffs against said Brooks.</p>\n<p>\"Fifth. That the other defendants stood in a different light before the court from Brooks, and the jury should inquire (if they found fraud in Brooks) whether said defendants had notice or knowledge of such fraud when they purchased the land held by them; and if the jury believed, from the evidence, that these other defendants (purchasers from Brooks) had notice or knowledge of such fraud, they should find also against them. But if, on the contrary, these purchasers had no such knowledge or notice, then the fraud in Brooks, their vendor, would not affect their title.</p>\n<p>\"Whereupon the attorney of the United States for the District of Louisiana excepted to the said refusal and charge, and tenders this as his bill of exceptions, which he prays may be signed and made part of the record.</p>\n     (Signed,)                     THEO. H. McCALEB, U.S. Judge.\"\n<p>A writ of error, sued out on behalf of the United States, brought these several rulings before this court.</p>\n<p>Such is the history of this transaction before and since it was brought into court by the United States.</p>\n<p>All of us concur in opinion, that no exception was taken by the counsel of the United States to the rulings of the District Court in this cause, which can be sustained here.</p>\n<p>We think that the treaty gave to the Grappes a fee simple title to all the rights which the Caddoes had in these lands, as fully as any patent from the government could make one. The reservation to the Grappes, \"their heirs and assigns for ever,\" creates as absolute a fee as any subsequent act upon the part of the United States could make. Nothing further was contemplated by the treaty to perfect the title.</p>\n<p>Brooks being the alienee of the Grappes for the entire reservation, he may hold it against any claim of the United States, as his alienors would have done.</p>\n<p>We have nothing to do, in our consideration of the case, with the conjectural intimations, which were made in the argument of it, concerning the influences which were used to secure the reservation, or the designs of the commissioner in having it done. The record shows that he became a purchaser for a valuable consideration. Whether for an adequate one is not for us to say. His right to the land against the claim of the United States, as that has been asserted in this case, we think good, and we shall direct the judgment of the court below to be affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed.</p>\n</div>", "id": 86617, "judges": "Wayne", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/86617/", "sha1": "fdb75b296628d7adc823d4da94b237a09cd3fb66", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:00:41"}
