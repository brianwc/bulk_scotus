It was founded upon county warrants. Five of them were for the sum of $1,000 each. The residue were for smaller sums, amounting in the aggregate to less than $500.

A transcript of the judgment, pursuant to the law of Iowa, was filed in the clerk's office of the District Court for the county on the 29th of January, 1866. Moore and Jamison left the county in October, 1866. After their departure, the sheriff, with process, made search for the record of the proceedings of the supervisors, and for the county seal.

There is still in the hands of the county treasurer, arising from these assessments, the further sum of $1,892.45, applicable in the same way.

When this announcement was made does not appear; but the evidence shows that in the same month of June in which he was retained the first payment was made upon the judgment. The second payment was made a year later. The warrants were found in the proper office in the fall of 1872, partly through the efforts of the counsel of Brown, who thereupon notified the counsel of the supervisors, and the warrants were placed in the hands of the latter.

Jur., sects. 894-896; Bigelow on Estoppel, 151; Freeman on Judgments, sects. 486, 489, 490, 495.</p>\n<p>Passing by without remark the filing of the transcript in the office of the county clerk, it is clear that on the 5th of September, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> 1871, the supervisors were expressly notified of the existence of the judgment, and for what it was recovered. Notwithstanding the large amount of spurious warrants known to have been issued, it does not appear that those officers thereupon inquired, retained counsel, or did any thing else to procure information touching the warrants upon which the judgment was founded.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, upon the same day, they imposed a tax for the payment of the judgment; and on the same day, one year later, the second levy was ordered for the same purpose. It appears they retained counsel at their session, in June, 1871, and, that upon searching in the proper clerk's office at Des Moines, the warrants in question could not be found. The search was made several times, with the same result. The counsel apprised the supervisors of the fact, and advised them that nothing could be done without the warrants. When this announcement was made does not appear; but the evidence shows that in the same month of June in which he was retained the first payment was made upon the judgment. The second payment was made a year later. The warrants were found in the proper office in the fall of 1872, partly through the efforts of the counsel of Brown, who thereupon notified the counsel of the supervisors, and the warrants were placed in the hands of the latter. The bill was not filed until at least half a year later.</p>\n<p>The Statute of Limitations of Iowa of five years, perhaps, does not apply, because the fraud, if it existed, was not known sufficiently early. The statute could run only from the time of the discovery. But a court of equity applies the rule of laches according to its own ideas of right and justice. Every case is governed chiefly by its own circumstances. Whether the time the negligence has subsisted is sufficient to make it effectual is a question to be resolved by the sound discretion of the court. Sullivan v. Portland &amp; Kennebec Railroad Co., 94 U.S. 806.</p>\n<p>The facts in this connection to which we have adverted are entitled to grave consideration.</p>\n<p>\"Nothing can call forth\"  a court of equity  \"into activity but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence. Where these are wanting, the court is passive, and does nothing. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> Laches and neglect are always discountenanced, and, therefore, from the beginning of this jurisdiction there was always a limitation of suits in this court.\" Smith v. Clay, Amb. 645. See also Story, Eq. Jur., sect. 1520 a; 94 U.S., supra; Sample v. Barnes, 14 How. 70; Walker et al. v. Robbins et al., id. 584; Creath's Administrator v. Simms, 5 id. 192; Bateman v.

Barker, 13 Cal. 295.</p>\n<p>The law of laches, like the principle of the limitation of actions, was dictated by experience, and is founded in a salutary policy. The lapse of time carries with it the memory and life of witnesses, the muniments of evidence, and other means of proof. The rule which gives it the effect prescribed is necessary to the peace, repose, and welfare of society. A departure from it would open an inlet to the evils intended to be excluded.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole case, we are of the opinion that the county is not entitled to the relief sought.</p>\n<p>Decree reversed and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill.</p>\n</div>", "id": 89573, "judges": "Swayne", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/89573/", "sha1": "fe9bc37dd5ccb25d06fd2d3f7cee79615c8f7333", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:09"}
