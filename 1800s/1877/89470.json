To aid in the construction of \"water-power\" is one of the purposes named. But the mill was a steam-mill. It was a custom grist-mill operated by steam. Does such an establishment fall within the description of \"other works of internal improvement\"? This expression is usually applied to railroads and canals. To confine it to those two subjects would be to give to the statute a narrow construction; and that it was not so intended is evident from the ninth section, where \"a bridge or other work of internal improvement, except railroads,\" is three times spoken of.

A ferry falls within the same principle, and so does a steam-mill. It would require great nicety of reasoning to give a definition of the expression \"internal improvement,\" which should include a grist-mill run by water, and exclude one operated by steam; or which would show that the means of transportation were more valuable to the people of Kansas than the means of obtaining bread.
