Flandrau</i> for the defendant in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suit involves the interpretation of the contract between the city of Winona and the Minnesota Railway Construction Company, bearing date April 23, 1870. It was brought on certain coupons which were attached to the bonds whereof mention is made in that contract, and delivered by the depositary to the company after one-half of them in number and value we e overdue. They were received by the plaintiff below, after their maturity and before the commencement of this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company stipulated that within three years from that date it would build, equip, and put in operation in its own name, or that of its successors and assigns, or of the St. Paul and Chicago Railway Company, a good and substantial railway from St. Paul to Winona (excepting a bridge across the Mississippi River at Hastings), and connect at Winona by bridge or ferry with the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad; that a part of said railway between certain points specifically mentioned should be completed and put in operation within one year; and that the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad, from its terminus opposite Winona, should be put in operation to a point on the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway east of north La Crosse within the year 1870.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was only by performing the stipulated conditions within the designated periods that the company could acquire a valid title to these evidences of indebtedness. In no case was any part of them to be delivered until a truss railroad bridge should be constructed across the Mississippi River at Winona, connecting the St. Paul and Chicago Railway, or the Winona and St. Peter Railroad, with the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad, at the then terminus of the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are the leading provisions of the contract. Its preamble recites that the construction of a railroad from St. Paul to Winona is of great public utility, and particularly advantageous to the latter city, and discloses that the controlling inducement for furnishing the promised aid to the company is to secure an unbroken line of travel by railroad between the East and West through Winona.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The depositary in whose hands the bonds and coupons were placed delivered them to the construction company March 27, 1872, after the road had been built from St. Paul to the western limits of Winona, and its track connected there with that of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liability of the city of pay these coupons is denied chiefly upon the ground that there was not such a compliance with the contract by the construction company as would entitle it to the possession of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill of exceptions shows that evidence was given tending to prove that the roads and parts of road mentioned in the contract had been respectively constructed, equipped, and put in operation within the appointed time, and the verdict of the jury is conclusive upon the questions of fact involved in the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exceptions to the charge of the court do not each require a special or extended consideration. At the date of the contract, the construction company had, for a certain consideration, agreed with the St. Paul and Chicago company to construct and equip its road between Chicago and St. Paul, and obtain the necessary right of way. It was to receive all gifts, bounties, or aids that might be given by any corporation or municipality to aid in building the projected road. The railroad company sold its road Jan. 3, 1872, to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and the latter was properly held by the court below to be the successor of the construction company within the meaning of the contract. That part of the road which was to be completed within twelve months was equipped and put in operation by the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company, under a contract with the Chicago and St. Paul Railroad Company, with the assent and approval of the construction company. In our opinion the court below correctly held, that constructing, equipping, and putting in operation the road between St. Paul and Winona by the construction company, the St. Paul and Chicago company, or the assignees of either, was in that regard a sufficient compliance with the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining charge to which exception was taken relates to the connection of the road from St. Paul with the track of the St. Peter Railway within the limits of Winona. The court instructed, that a connection of the track of the last-named railway with the railroad bridge across the river at Winona&#8212;said bridge connecting with the La Crosse Railroad at the point named in the contract&#8212;was a connection by bridge or ferry within the meaning of that contract, if, after the purchase of the St. Paul and Chicago Railroad by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, the latter company continued to run its cars over the railroad bridge and the Winona and St. Peter Railroad within the limits of the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended that building the railway from St. Paul to the western limit of Winona, and uniting it there with the Winona and St. Peter road at a point more than a mile west of the west end of the bridge connecting the latter road with the La Crosse Railroad, was not, in the just sense of the term, a connecting of the road from St. Paul by bridge with the La Crosse Railroad, within the meaning or purview of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract, as we construe it, stipulates that the contemplated connection may be made by means of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad. One of its early provisions declares that the connection between the St. Paul and the La Crosse roads at Winona shall be by means of a bridge or ferry; but a subsequent one is express, that the bonds shall not be delivered until the bridge is constructed across the river at Winona, connecting the St. Paul Railway or the Winona and St. Peter road with the La Crosse roal at the then terminus of the latter. It was, therefore, optional with the construction company to build the St. Paul Railway over the bridge, and form an actual junction with the La Crosse road; or to build it to any point in the city, and make the required connection by means of the Winona and St. Peter road. Either of these modes would secure the object desired by the city, an uninterrupted communication by rail from St. Paul across the river at Winona to the eastern seaboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended that the contract is against public policy and without consideration. The obvious answer is, that it was expressly sanctioned by an act of the legislature of the State, and was designed to insure and expedite the construction of works of internal improvement deemed of vital importance to the material interests of the city. Whether it be expedient to invest municipal corporations with authority to aid in building railways, is a question foreign to the present inquiry; but where, as in ths instance, it has been conferred and exercised, and the city has secured the advantages of the contract, the law will not suffer her to escape from its obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Judgment affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Flandrau</i> for the defendant in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suit involves the interpretation of the contract between the city of Winona and the Minnesota Railway Construction Company, bearing date April 23, 1870. It was brought on certain coupons which were attached to the bonds whereof mention is made in that contract, and delivered by the depositary to the company after one-half of them in number and value we e overdue. They were received by the plaintiff below, after their maturity and before the commencement of this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company stipulated that within three years from that date it would build, equip, and put in operation in its own name, or that of its successors and assigns, or of the St. Paul and Chicago Railway Company, a good and substantial railway from St. Paul to Winona (excepting a bridge across the Mississippi River at Hastings), and connect at Winona by bridge or ferry with the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad; that a part of said railway between certain points specifically mentioned should be completed and put in operation within one year; and that the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad, from its terminus opposite Winona, should be put in operation to a point on the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway east of north La Crosse within the year 1870.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was only by performing the stipulated conditions within the designated periods that the company could acquire a valid title to these evidences of indebtedness. In no case was any part of them to be delivered until a truss railroad bridge should be constructed across the Mississippi River at Winona, connecting the St. Paul and Chicago Railway, or the Winona and St. Peter Railroad, with the La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott Railroad, at the then terminus of the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are the leading provisions of the contract. Its preamble recites that the construction of a railroad from St. Paul to Winona is of great public utility, and particularly advantageous to the latter city, and discloses that the controlling inducement for furnishing the promised aid to the company is to secure an unbroken line of travel by railroad between the East and West through Winona.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The depositary in whose hands the bonds and coupons were placed delivered them to the construction company March 27, 1872, after the road had been built from St. Paul to the western limits of Winona, and its track connected there with that of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liability of the city of pay these coupons is denied chiefly upon the ground that there was not such a compliance with the contract by the construction company as would entitle it to the possession of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill of exceptions shows that evidence was given tending to prove that the roads and parts of road mentioned in the contract had been respectively constructed, equipped, and put in operation within the appointed time, and the verdict of the jury is conclusive upon the questions of fact involved in the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exceptions to the charge of the court do not each require a special or extended consideration. At the date of the contract, the construction company had, for a certain consideration, agreed with the St. Paul and Chicago company to construct and equip its road between Chicago and St. Paul, and obtain the necessary right of way. It was to receive all gifts, bounties, or aids that might be given by any corporation or municipality to aid in building the projected road. The railroad company sold its road Jan. 3, 1872, to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and the latter was properly held by the court below to be the successor of the construction company within the meaning of the contract. That part of the road which was to be completed within twelve months was equipped and put in operation by the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company, under a contract with the Chicago and St. Paul Railroad Company, with the assent and approval of the construction company. In our opinion the court below correctly held, that constructing, equipping, and putting in operation the road between St. Paul and Winona by the construction company, the St. Paul and Chicago company, or the assignees of either, was in that regard a sufficient compliance with the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining charge to which exception was taken relates to the connection of the road from St. Paul with the track of the St. Peter Railway within the limits of Winona. The court instructed, that a connection of the track of the last-named railway with the railroad bridge across the river at Winona&#8212;said bridge connecting with the La Crosse Railroad at the point named in the contract&#8212;was a connection by bridge or ferry within the meaning of that contract, if, after the purchase of the St. Paul and Chicago Railroad by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, the latter company continued to run its cars over the railroad bridge and the Winona and St. Peter Railroad within the limits of the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended that building the railway from St. Paul to the western limit of Winona, and uniting it there with the Winona and St. Peter road at a point more than a mile west of the west end of the bridge connecting the latter road with the La Crosse Railroad, was not, in the just sense of the term, a connecting of the road from St. Paul by bridge with the La Crosse Railroad, within the meaning or purview of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract, as we construe it, stipulates that the contemplated connection may be made by means of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad. One of its early provisions declares that the connection between the St. Paul and the La Crosse roads at Winona shall be by means of a bridge or ferry; but a subsequent one is express, that the bonds shall not be delivered until the bridge is constructed across the river at Winona, connecting the St. Paul Railway or the Winona and St. Peter road with the La Crosse roal at the then terminus of the latter. It was, therefore, optional with the construction company to build the St. Paul Railway over the bridge, and form an actual junction with the La Crosse road; or to build it to any point in the city, and make the required connection by means of the Winona and St. Peter road. Either of these modes would secure the object desired by the city, an uninterrupted communication by rail from St. Paul across the river at Winona to the eastern seaboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended that the contract is against public policy and without consideration. The obvious answer is, that it was expressly sanctioned by an act of the legislature of the State, and was designed to insure and expedite the construction of works of internal improvement deemed of vital importance to the material interests of the city. Whether it be expedient to invest municipal corporations with authority to aid in building railways, is a question foreign to the present inquiry; but where, as in ths instance, it has been conferred and exercised, and the city has secured the advantages of the contract, the law will not suffer her to escape from its obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Judgment affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
