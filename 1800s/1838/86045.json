Arredondo, Jr., and also the contract of 13th July, 1824, between the complainant and F.M. Arredondo, from the manner in which they are set out in the bill of complainant and replied to by the defendant, are such exhibits as ought to have been annexed by the complainant to his bill in the superior court for the district of East Florida, and ought to have been proved as evidence in the cause, or the non-production thereof duly accounted for, and secondary evidence of the contents thereof, as far as practicable, given, before the superior court of the territory of Florida proceeded to render any decree in the premises: that for this defect and imperfection in the proceedings, this Court have not sufficient materials before them whereon to found any final and satisfactory decree; and that justice requires that the cause should be opened in the court below for further proofs, as well in regard to the documents aforesaid, as in regard to any other evidence which may further establish the merits of the case on either side.
