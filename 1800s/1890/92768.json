(4) The defendant, Henry Lyng, is employed by said Hagemeister &amp; Son as their agent, on a regular salary, to look after their said warehouse, to take orders for and deliver said beer, so manufactured and stored, in quantities exceeding three gallons, and to collect and remit the proceeds of the sales thereof to Hagemeister &amp; Son, and was so employed on the 19th day of July, 1888. (5) On July 19, 1888, at the village of Iron River, in the county of Iron and state of Michigan, said defendant, in the course of said employment by Hagemeister &amp; Son, did deliver from said warehouse to Martin Lally, and to divers other persons, all of whom paid him therefor, certain of said lager-beer so made and shipped by Hagemeister &amp; Son from Green Bay aforesaid, in quantities exceeding three gallons. All of said lager-beer was so delivered in the original packages in which it had been shipped. The defendant sold no other liquors. (6) Neither the said defendant nor the said Hagemeister &amp; Son, or either of them, have paid any tax in the village of Iron River, aforesaid, on the business of selling or keeping for sale malt liquors at wholesale or at wholesale and retail, nor given any bond such as is mentioned in Act No. 313 of the Public Acts of Michigan for 1887.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 1, 2, 4, 7, and 24 of Act No. 313 of Pub. Acts Mich. 1887, p. 445 et seq., are as follows: 'Section 1. The people of the state of Michigan enact that in all townships, cities, and villages of this state there shall be paid annually the following tax upon the business of manufacturing, selling, or keeping for sale, by all persons whose business, in whole or in part, consists in selling or keeping for sale, or manufacturing, distilled or brewed or malt liquors or mixed liquors, as follows: Upon the business of selling or offering for sale spirituous or intoxicating liquors, or mixed liquors, by retail, or any mixture or compound, excepting proprietary patent medicines, which in whole or in part consist of spirituous or intoxicating liquors, and any malt, brewed, or fermented liquors, five hundred dollars per annum; upon the business of selling only brewed or malt liquors at wholesale or retail, or at wholesale and retail, three hundred dollars per annum; upon the business of selling spirituous or intoxicating liquors at wholesale, five hundred dollars, or at wholesale and retail, eight hundred dollars, per annum; upon the business of manufacturing brewed or malt liquors for sale, sixty-five dollars per annum; upon the business of manufacturing for sale spirituous or intoxicating liquors, eight hundred dollars per annum. No person paying a tax on spirituous or intoxicating liquors under this act shall be liable to pay any tax on the sale of malt, brewed, or fermented liquors. No person paying a manufacturer's tax on brewed or malt liquors under this act shall be liable to pay a wholesale dealer's tax on the same.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2.

Wholesale dealers shall be held and deemed to mean and include all persons who sell or offer for sale such liquors and beverages in quantities of more than three gallons, or more than one dozen quart bottles, at any one time, to any person or persons. No tax imposed under this act shall be required from any person for selling any wine or cider made from fruits grown or gathered in this State, unless such wine or cider be sold by the drink as other beverages are.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4.

And any person or persons engaged in any business requiring the payment of a tax under section one of this act, who, after paying the tax so required, shall be convicted of the violation of any of the provisions of this act, shall thereby, in addition to all other penalties prescribed by this act, forfeit the tax so paid by him or them, and be preached from continuing such business for the remainder of the year or time for which said tax was paid, and be debarred from again engaging in any business requiring the payment of a tax under section one of this act, or from becoming a surety or sureties upon any bond required under section seven of this act, for the period of one year from the time of such conviction.

And it shall be the duty of sheriffs, marshals, constables and police officers to forthwith close all saloons and other places where the business of manufacturing, selling or keeping for sale any of the liquors mentioned in section one of this act is being conducted, upon which business the tax required by said section one has not been paid in full, and in which the receipt mentioned in section five of this act shall not be posted up and displayed.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. All persons engaged in the business of selling or keeping for sale any of the liquors mentioned in this act, whether as owner or as clerk, agent, or servant or employe', shall be equally liable as principals for any violation of any of the provisions of this act, and any person or principal shall be liable for the acts of his clerk, servant, agent or employe' for any violation of the provisions of this act.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Howard E.

The manufacturer of malt or brewed liquors made outside of the state of Michigan cannot introduce them into the hands of consumers or retail dealers in that state without becoming subject to this wholesale dealer's tax of $300 per annum in every township, village, or city where he attempts to do this.

Rep. 689, 1062, it was decided that a section of the Code of the state of Iowa forbidding common carriers to bring intoxicating liquors into the state from any other state or territory, without first being furnished with a certificate as prescribed, was essentially a regulation of commerce among the states, and, not being sanctioned by the authority, express or implied, of congress, was invalid, because repugnant to the constitution of the United States; and in Leisy v. Hardin, ante, 681, the judgment in which has just been announced, that the right of importation of ardent spirits, distilled liquors, ale, and beer from one state into another, includes, by necessary implication, the right of sale in the original packages at the place where the importation terminates, and that the power cannot be conceded to a state to exclude, directly or indirectly, the subjects of interstate commerce, or, by the imposition of burdens thereon, to regulate such commerce, without congressional permission. The same rule that applies to the sugar of Louisiana, the cotton of South Carolina, the wines of California, the hops of Washington, the tobacco of Maryland and Connecticut, or the products, natural or manufactured, of any state, applies to all commodities in which a right of traffic exists, recognized by the laws of congress, the decisions of courts, and the usages of the commercial world. It devolves on congress to indicate such exceptions as, in its judgment, a wise discretion may demand under particular circumstances.
