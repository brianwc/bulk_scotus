Thereupon, in accordance with the statutory practice in such cases in Mississippi, and issue was joined between the plaintiffs in attachment and the claimant, to try their respective titles to the property.

This is an error, in any view that can be taken of the rights of the parties. Even on the supposition that the partnership stock was held under an express and positive trust for partnership creditors, equity would give the latter only so much of the fund as represented the partnership property, and would divide it as to values between the parties beneficially interested, even although the specific goods might not be separable. This being so, it could hardly be charged, as a matter of law, that an appropriation of the mingled stock to the extent of a value no greater than would be allowed in equity to individual creditors, in marshaling the assets for distribution, between them and the creditors of the partnership, amounted to a fraud upon the latter.
