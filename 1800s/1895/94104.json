Winter, had been taken up by him, the entire sidewalk excavated, apartments for business purposes constructed in the excavation so made, and a new pavement laid, and that this was done by permission of the city council of Montgomery (defendant in error), as evidenced by a report of a special committee, dated July, 1870, and made Exhibit B to the original bill. It is further set forth that, after the complainant had been for many years in the use of the improvements so made, the city authorities removed the pavement and the structure underneath, filled in the excavation, put down a new and different kind of pavement, known as the 'Schillinger Pavement,' and have since excluded the complainant from the use of the space underneath the pavement in connection with the building adjacent, and that great damage has resulted from these acts of the city authorities.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears, also, from the original bill, that the city authorities committed the alleged wrongs complained of on the ground, as they claimed, that the sidewalk was out of repair and dangerous for passengers, and that it could only be properly repaired in the way they had done; that complainant had several times during a period of more than a year attempted to make the repairs which had been suggested by the authorities, but that they had prevented his doing so in the way he proposed, and had insisted on the old pavement being replaced by the Schillinger pavement, in pursuance of an ordinance of the city council adopted August 18, 1883, and which is made Exhibit C to the bill.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The permission given for making the excavation, etc., made Exhibit B to the bill, is as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Montgomery, Ala., July, 1870.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The undersigned, a special committee on the subject, appointed by the city council of Montgomery with power to act, hereby authorize J.

Winter, for plaintiff in error, contended, among other things: 'That while it appears by the record that the judgment of the state court might have been based either upon a law which would raise the question of repugnaney to the constitution of the United States, or upon some other independent ground, it does not appear that the court did, in point of fact, base its judgment on such independent ground, and not on the law raising the federal question.' And that, 'if it appears from the record, however deduced, that a federal question was not in point of fact raised by the complainant,&#8212;and this, of course, is apparent,&#8212;it will be assumed that the court, as in duty bound, considered and decided it; and thus, that the case was not decided upon independent grounds alone. But, as independent grounds are also shown to have been raised by the record, and, under a like rule, must be presumed to have been decided, the conclusion would appear to be that the judgment was based on the fullest consideration of both the local and federal questions raised in the proceedings, which the court is petitioned to review,'&#8212;citing New Orleans Waterworks Co. v.
