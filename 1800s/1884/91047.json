The act of March 3, 1883, <i>c.</i> 143, (22 St. 631,) making</p>\n          <p>appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the government for the</p>\n          <p>fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, made an entire change in the</p>\n          <p>emoluments of the clerk of this court. Before that act the clerk</p>\n          <p>collected the fees of his office, paid the expenses, and kept what</p>\n          <p>remained as his own compensation. He was not accountable to the</p>\n          <p>government or to any one else for the income. The act of 1883</p>\n          <p>established a maximum for his annual compensation, and required to</p>\n          <p>pay into the treasury all the fees and emoluments of the office</p>\n          <p>over his salary, necessary clerk hire, and incidental expenses.</p>\n          <p>The same act made it the duty of the court to prepare a table of</p>\n          <p>fees to be charged by the clerk. This was done, and among the</p>\n          <p>rest, is the following: 'For preparing the record or a transcript</p>\n          <p>thereof for the printer, indexing the same, supervising the</p>\n          <p>printing, and distributing the printed copies to the justices, the</p>\n          <p>reporter, the law library, and the parties or their counsel,</p>\n          <p>fifteen cents per folio.' Rule 24, &#167; 7.</p>\n          <p>The clerk is responsible to the court for the correctness and</p>\n          <p>proper indexing of the printed copies of the record, for their</p>\n          <p>presentation to the justices in the form and of the size</p>\n          <p>prescribed by the rules, and for their delivery, when required, to</p>\n          <p>the parties entitled thereto.

If the parties themselves</p>\n          <p>furnish the printed copies, the fee must be paid, if demanded, in</p>\n          <p>time to enable him to make the necessary examinations and be ready</p>\n          <p>to deliver the copies to the parties or their counsel and to the</p>\n          <p>[403]</p>\n          <p>court when needed for any purpose in the progress of the cause.</p>\n          <p>The fee is for the service specified in this item of the table,</p>\n          <p>and is indivisible.

So that if the printed copies are used</p>\n          <p>for any purpose in the progress of the cause the whole fee is</p>\n          <p>chargeable.
