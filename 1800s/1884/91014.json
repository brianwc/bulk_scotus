It was commenced by Dimpfell, an individual stockholder in the company, who stated in his bill, that it was filed on behalf of himself and such other stockholders as might join him in the suit. Callaghan, another stockholder, is the only one who joined him. The two claim to be the owners of fifteen hundred shares of the stock of the company.
