The plaintiff is the owner of a railroad commencing at Ogdensburg, on Lake Ontario, and terminating at Plattsburgh, on Lake Champlain. The defendant owns a road between Nashua and Lowell. The Vermont &amp; Canada Railroad Company, the Vermont Central Railroad Company, the Northern Railroad Company of New Hampshire, the Concord Railroad Company of New Hampshire, the Nashua &amp; Lowell of New Hampshire, and the Boston &amp; Lowell of Massachusetts, were all largely interested in the freight and passenger business which came over the Ogdensburg road from the great lakes for points in New England and Canada, and which went from the latter to the lakes. The Vermont Central and the Vermont and Canada companies were in the hands of receivers, or trustees, appointed by courts under whose control they were, and these trustees had a lease of the Ogdensburg road for 20 years from March 1, 1870. In this condition of the affairs of these companies a contract was made between them all except the Concord Company, the object of which was to secure an increased traffic over all these roads by obtaining control of the Northern Transportation Company of Ohio, which was also a party to the contract, and which was engaged in steamboat transportation on the Western lakes. One of the items of this agreement was that the Ogdensburg Company should advance a sum not exceeding $600,000 to secure this control, which it did, and the only question on the present appeal is whether, by virtue of the contract, the several railroad companies which were parties to it, were bound to repay to the appellant this money at all events, or were only bound to pay out of receipts from the traffic which came to them severally from this transportation company over the Ogdensburg road. This requires a careful examination of the contract, and a consideration of the circumstances under which it was made. The agreement is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Articles of agreement between the Northern Transportation Company of Ohio, a corporation established under the laws of Ohio, party of the first part; J. Gregory Smith, of St. Albans, Vermont, and George Stark, of Nashua, New Hampshire, parties of the second part; and the trustees and managers of the Vermont Central and Vermont &amp; Canada Railroad Companies, the Northern Railroad of New Hampshire, (the Concord Railroad Corporation of New Hampshire, provided they execute this agreement,) the Nashua &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation of Massachusetts, parties of the third part; and the Ogdensburg &amp; Lake Champlain Railroad Company, the party of the fourth part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Whereas, the above-named railroad companies and trustees and managers, which have become parties to agreements hereto annexed, bearing date the twenty-fourth day of February, A. D. 1870, and whose tracks form a large part of the connecting line between Boston, in Massachusetts, and Ogdensburg, in New York, depend largely for their business upon the regular transportation, by steamers, of freight and passengers between said Ogdensburg and the western cities and towns upon the great lakes; and whereas, the party of the first part was chartered to carry on the business of such transportation, but by reason of financial embarrassments is unable to carry it on efficiently, and it is feared that its steamers may be taken from this line; and whereas, the parties of the third part and the party of the fourth part believe it to be for their and the public interest to advance or lend to the parties of the second part some portion of the gross receipts for the transportation of freight and passengers to be brought to and from their line by the steamers of the party of the first part, in order to secure the most regular, efficient, and permanent service by steamers between Ogdensburg and said western cities and towns for the term of nineteen years from the first day of March, A. D. 1871; and whereas, the parties of the second part have agreed to use all sums advanced or lent to them to secure the ownership or the control of the stock of said party of the first part, and otherwise to secure the most efficient management of its business to carry out the purposes of this agreement, and for no other purposes, and to hold all said stock which they may hold or control, and all other property or rights which they may purchase or otherwise acquire with said funds, except debts due from said party of the first part, in trust to secure the repayment of all sums which may be so advanced or lent, as aforesaid, with interest, as hereinafter provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, it is covenanted and agreed between said parties as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>Article First</i>.

D. eighteen hundred and seventy-one.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ogdensburg road advanced the $600,000, and it was used for the purpose mentioned in the agreement. The transportation company became bankrupt in the year 1874, the business was broken up, and has never been resumed under the contract. A part of the money advanced by the Ogdensburh Company has been paid to it. It made settlements with some of the companies, or their trustees, in regard to its claim, and it brought this suit against the Nashua &amp; Lowell Company for what it alleges to be its proportion of the sum unpaid. It is not asserted by the plaintiff that the parties who are described in the agreement as the partis of the third part are jointly liable for this deficiency. If so, no suit could be maintained against the defendant here without joining the others. It is not asserted that there are any words of express promise to pay by either of those companies the whole or any definite part of this $600,000. The argument of counsel is that there arises an implied promise out of the nature of the transaction. We have looked in vain for anything in the language of the agreement which requires or justifies such an implication. If there were in the agreement any words which showed that the party of the third part had borrowed this money from the party of the fourth part, or that the latter had loaned it to the former, the argument would be of weight. But the language of article 2, which relates to this part of the transaction, is that 'the party of the fourth part will, in case it shall be necessary to secure the regular and efficient running of said steamers to and from Ogdensburg, when called on by the parties of the <i>second part</i>, advance, from time to time, sums not exceeding in all six hundred thousand dollars, to be used by said parties of the <i>second part</i> for the same purposes as said semi-annual payments, and to be <i>pro tanto in lieu</i> thereof, and to be repaid out of said semi-annual reservations as hereinafter prescribed, it being understood and agreed that each of said parties of the third part shall <i>only</i> be liable to reserve and advance or pay to the parties of the second part or to the party of the fourth part, as the case may be, its share of such reservation, advance, or payment, to be ascertained by the proportion which said gross receipts of each of said parties bear to the entire amount of said gross receipts between Ogdensburg and points eastward, upon road owned, leased, or operated by any of said third parties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be observed, in the <i>first</i> place, that the transaction is here called an <i>advance</i>, and not a loan; and, <i>secondly</i>, that the advance is made to the party of the <i>second</i> part, and not to the party of the <i>third</i> part. This party of the second part was J. Gregory Smith and George Stark, who were made trustees to receive this money, and see to its investment in securing the service of the transportation company, and who were to receive and refund to the Ogdensburg Company, for this advance, a certain proportion of the gross receipts of the railroad companies constituting the party of the third part, which was relied on to repay that company in full. This same article, in the very sentence in which the Ogdensburg Company agrees to advance the money to Smith and Stark, declares that each of the parties of the third part shall <i>only</i> be liable to reserve and advance or <i>pay</i> to the parties of the second part, or to the parties of the fourth part, its share of such reservation, to be ascertained by its proportion of said gross receipts. It is here also said that this advance is to be repaid out of said semi-annual reservation as hereinafter provided. We thus see, in this single article, that the money is to be advanced to the trustees, what use is to be made of it, that it is to be repaid out of a fund called the semi-annual reservation to be after wards provided, and that neither to the trustees nor to the Ogdensburg Company are the parties comprising the third party to become liable beyond its share of this reservation. This reservation is described in the same article of the agreement as a semi-annual sum not exceeding $150,000, or so much as may be adequate for the purposes herein set forth, 'out of the gross receipts either upon said line or upon any roads now leased or operated by the parties of the third part, or either of them, for transportation of freight and passengers brought to said line at Ogdensburg by the steamers of the party of the first part.' By article 4 these trustees are required to hold all the stock of the transportation company which they now have or may acquire, and all other property or rights which they may acquire under this agreement, to secure the repayment of the sums advanced by the Ogdensburg Company and by the parties of the third part, with interest thereon at 10 per cent. per annum. Article 5 makes a further provision for payment, out of this reservation from the gross receipts of the semi-annual interests of this advance by the Ogdensburg Company, and for a sinking fund to pay all in excess of the loan over $500,000, within two years, and the remainder within the nineteen years the contract had to run. It will be observed that this agreement was intended to expire at the same time that the lease of the Ogdensburg road expired. In all this it will be perceived that, while the mode of the repayment of the advance of $600,000 is carefully and repeatedly stated, and the security provided, it is nowhere hinted that the railroad companies of the third part are to be liable for it if these sources of payment fail. Indeed, the third article provides for security for advances which they may make in the same terms that it provides for the party of the fourth part, which is the Ogdensburg Company; and the language we have cited from article second, that each of the parties of the third part is liable <i>only</i> on this account for its proportionate reservation from the proceeds of traffic derived from the Ogdensburg road, leaves little room for further doubt that these resources were alone bound for the repayment of this advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The learned counsel for appellant makes a forcible argument against this view, based on the assumption that the Ogdensburg company had no interest in the traffic of the roads embraced in this agreement, because, its road being leased for a period coincident with that of this contract, the lessees received all its benefits and the company none. It must be confessed that if the Ogdensburg company had no other interest in the transaction than to secure the repayment of a loan of money and the interest on it, as if made by any other capitalist, the suggestion would be entitled to much weight; but in this assumption counsel is in error. The preamble recites, as one of the main inducements to making the agreement, that 'by reason of financial embarrassments the transportation company will be unable to continue its business, and its steamers will be withdrawn; and whereas, parties of the third part and the party of the fourth part (the Ogdensburg Company) <i>believe it to be for their interest</i> and the public interest to advance,' etc. The interest of the Ogdensburg company is here clearly stated as the cause of its advance of the money, though at the time the agreement was executed its road had already been leased a year, and the fact of the lease is recited in the agreement. Though this lease was for a fixed annual rent, the lessees were the trustees of two other railroad companies which were insolvent, and these trustees could only rely on the profits or receipts arising from this road to enable them to pay the rent. Indeed, so well founded was the apprehension of failure of rent arising from this fact, that in a few weeks after the withdrawal of the boats of the Northern Transportation Company the lease was rescinded, the road restored to the company, and the trustees of the two Vermont railroad companies released from any further liability on the contract we are now trying to construe. It is reasonably certain that the Ogdensburg Railroad Corporation had a deep interest in the success of the enterprise inaugurated by this contract, and probably a larger interest than any other party to the agreement, and clearly saw that it must make this advance, the only thing it did in the matter, at the risk of the success of the adventure, with such security for obtaining a return out of the proceeds of it as the contract gave. A stipulation of the parties was made on submitting the case to the court below, that, if that court held that no liability under the contract attached beyond that for a proportion of the gross receipts, there were no such receipts in defendant's hands, and the bill should be dismissed without requiring an accounting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court construed the contract as we do, and its decree dismissing the bill is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BLATCHFORD, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> S.

The plaintiff is the owner of a railroad commencing at Ogdensburg, on Lake Ontario, and terminating at Plattsburgh, on Lake Champlain. The defendant owns a road between Nashua and Lowell. The Vermont &amp; Canada Railroad Company, the Vermont Central Railroad Company, the Northern Railroad Company of New Hampshire, the Concord Railroad Company of New Hampshire, the Nashua &amp; Lowell of New Hampshire, and the Boston &amp; Lowell of Massachusetts, were all largely interested in the freight and passenger business which came over the Ogdensburg road from the great lakes for points in New England and Canada, and which went from the latter to the lakes. The Vermont Central and the Vermont and Canada companies were in the hands of receivers, or trustees, appointed by courts under whose control they were, and these trustees had a lease of the Ogdensburg road for 20 years from March 1, 1870. In this condition of the affairs of these companies a contract was made between them all except the Concord Company, the object of which was to secure an increased traffic over all these roads by obtaining control of the Northern Transportation Company of Ohio, which was also a party to the contract, and which was engaged in steamboat transportation on the Western lakes. One of the items of this agreement was that the Ogdensburg Company should advance a sum not exceeding $600,000 to secure this control, which it did, and the only question on the present appeal is whether, by virtue of the contract, the several railroad companies which were parties to it, were bound to repay to the appellant this money at all events, or were only bound to pay out of receipts from the traffic which came to them severally from this transportation company over the Ogdensburg road. This requires a careful examination of the contract, and a consideration of the circumstances under which it was made. The agreement is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Articles of agreement between the Northern Transportation Company of Ohio, a corporation established under the laws of Ohio, party of the first part; J.

D. eighteen hundred and seventy-one.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ogdensburg road advanced the $600,000, and it was used for the purpose mentioned in the agreement. The transportation company became bankrupt in the year 1874, the business was broken up, and has never been resumed under the contract. A part of the money advanced by the Ogdensburh Company has been paid to it. It made settlements with some of the companies, or their trustees, in regard to its claim, and it brought this suit against the Nashua &amp; Lowell Company for what it alleges to be its proportion of the sum unpaid. It is not asserted by the plaintiff that the parties who are described in the agreement as the partis of the third part are jointly liable for this deficiency. If so, no suit could be maintained against the defendant here without joining the others. It is not asserted that there are any words of express promise to pay by either of those companies the whole or any definite part of this $600,000. The argument of counsel is that there arises an implied promise out of the nature of the transaction. We have looked in vain for anything in the language of the agreement which requires or justifies such an implication. If there were in the agreement any words which showed that the party of the third part had borrowed this money from the party of the fourth part, or that the latter had loaned it to the former, the argument would be of weight. But the language of article 2, which relates to this part of the transaction, is that 'the party of the fourth part will, in case it shall be necessary to secure the regular and efficient running of said steamers to and from Ogdensburg, when called on by the parties of the <i>second part</i>, advance, from time to time, sums not exceeding in all six hundred thousand dollars, to be used by said parties of the <i>second part</i> for the same purposes as said semi-annual payments, and to be <i>pro tanto in lieu</i> thereof, and to be repaid out of said semi-annual reservations as hereinafter prescribed, it being understood and agreed that each of said parties of the third part shall <i>only</i> be liable to reserve and advance or pay to the parties of the second part or to the party of the fourth part, as the case may be, its share of such reservation, advance, or payment, to be ascertained by the proportion which said gross receipts of each of said parties bear to the entire amount of said gross receipts between Ogdensburg and points eastward, upon road owned, leased, or operated by any of said third parties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be observed, in the <i>first</i> place, that the transaction is here called an <i>advance</i>, and not a loan; and, <i>secondly</i>, that the advance is made to the party of the <i>second</i> part, and not to the party of the <i>third</i> part. This party of the second part was J. Gregory Smith and George Stark, who were made trustees to receive this money, and see to its investment in securing the service of the transportation company, and who were to receive and refund to the Ogdensburg Company, for this advance, a certain proportion of the gross receipts of the railroad companies constituting the party of the third part, which was relied on to repay that company in full. This same article, in the very sentence in which the Ogdensburg Company agrees to advance the money to Smith and Stark, declares that each of the parties of the third part shall <i>only</i> be liable to reserve and advance or <i>pay</i> to the parties of the second part, or to the parties of the fourth part, its share of such reservation, to be ascertained by its proportion of said gross receipts. It is here also said that this advance is to be repaid out of said semi-annual reservation as hereinafter provided. We thus see, in this single article, that the money is to be advanced to the trustees, what use is to be made of it, that it is to be repaid out of a fund called the semi-annual reservation to be after wards provided, and that neither to the trustees nor to the Ogdensburg Company are the parties comprising the third party to become liable beyond its share of this reservation. This reservation is described in the same article of the agreement as a semi-annual sum not exceeding $150,000, or so much as may be adequate for the purposes herein set forth, 'out of the gross receipts either upon said line or upon any roads now leased or operated by the parties of the third part, or either of them, for transportation of freight and passengers brought to said line at Ogdensburg by the steamers of the party of the first part.' By article 4 these trustees are required to hold all the stock of the transportation company which they now have or may acquire, and all other property or rights which they may acquire under this agreement, to secure the repayment of the sums advanced by the Ogdensburg Company and by the parties of the third part, with interest thereon at 10 per cent. per annum. Article 5 makes a further provision for payment, out of this reservation from the gross receipts of the semi-annual interests of this advance by the Ogdensburg Company, and for a sinking fund to pay all in excess of the loan over $500,000, within two years, and the remainder within the nineteen years the contract had to run. It will be observed that this agreement was intended to expire at the same time that the lease of the Ogdensburg road expired. In all this it will be perceived that, while the mode of the repayment of the advance of $600,000 is carefully and repeatedly stated, and the security provided, it is nowhere hinted that the railroad companies of the third part are to be liable for it if these sources of payment fail. Indeed, the third article provides for security for advances which they may make in the same terms that it provides for the party of the fourth part, which is the Ogdensburg Company; and the language we have cited from article second, that each of the parties of the third part is liable <i>only</i> on this account for its proportionate reservation from the proceeds of traffic derived from the Ogdensburg road, leaves little room for further doubt that these resources were alone bound for the repayment of this advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The learned counsel for appellant makes a forcible argument against this view, based on the assumption that the Ogdensburg company had no interest in the traffic of the roads embraced in this agreement, because, its road being leased for a period coincident with that of this contract, the lessees received all its benefits and the company none. It must be confessed that if the Ogdensburg company had no other interest in the transaction than to secure the repayment of a loan of money and the interest on it, as if made by any other capitalist, the suggestion would be entitled to much weight; but in this assumption counsel is in error. The preamble recites, as one of the main inducements to making the agreement, that 'by reason of financial embarrassments the transportation company will be unable to continue its business, and its steamers will be withdrawn; and whereas, parties of the third part and the party of the fourth part (the Ogdensburg Company) <i>believe it to be for their interest</i> and the public interest to advance,' etc. The interest of the Ogdensburg company is here clearly stated as the cause of its advance of the money, though at the time the agreement was executed its road had already been leased a year, and the fact of the lease is recited in the agreement. Though this lease was for a fixed annual rent, the lessees were the trustees of two other railroad companies which were insolvent, and these trustees could only rely on the profits or receipts arising from this road to enable them to pay the rent. Indeed, so well founded was the apprehension of failure of rent arising from this fact, that in a few weeks after the withdrawal of the boats of the Northern Transportation Company the lease was rescinded, the road restored to the company, and the trustees of the two Vermont railroad companies released from any further liability on the contract we are now trying to construe. It is reasonably certain that the Ogdensburg Railroad Corporation had a deep interest in the success of the enterprise inaugurated by this contract, and probably a larger interest than any other party to the agreement, and clearly saw that it must make this advance, the only thing it did in the matter, at the risk of the success of the adventure, with such security for obtaining a return out of the proceeds of it as the contract gave. A stipulation of the parties was made on submitting the case to the court below, that, if that court held that no liability under the contract attached beyond that for a proportion of the gross receipts, there were no such receipts in defendant's hands, and the bill should be dismissed without requiring an accounting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court construed the contract as we do, and its decree dismissing the bill is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BLATCHFORD, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> S.
