The record shows that the suit was begun by Shirley, the appellee, a citizen of Texas, on the sixteenth of July, 1870, in the district court of McLennan county, Texas, against the Waco Tap Railroad Company, a Texas corporation, to recover a balance claimed to be due on a contract for the construction of the railroad of the defendant company. The company answered the petition on the twenty-fifth of November, 1870. Supplemental petitions were filed on the sixteenth and seventeenth of December, 1872, bringing in the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad Company, another Texas corporation, as a defendant. The case was tried to a jury on the second of February, 1875, and judgment rendered in favor of Shirley. This judgment was reversed by the supreme court of the state on the twenty-eighth of December, 1875, upon a writ of error brought by the* Waco Tap Company, and on the sixteenth of March, 1877, the cause was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. After the case got back to the district court the petition was several times amended, to the effect that since the commencement of the suit the road, road-bed, franchises, etc., of the Waco Tap Company had been sold to the Houston &amp; Texas Central Company under a deed of trust, and that the Waco Tap Company had become merged in the Houston &amp; Texas Central Company. The Houston &amp; Texas Central and the Waco Tap companies answered this amended petition, and the cause was again tried to a jury and a judgment rendered in favor of Shirley on the twenty-fifth of November, 1878. This judgment also was reversed by the supreme court of the state on the sixteenth of January, 1880, and the cause again remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute of Texas provides that: 'Whenever a sale of the road-bed, track, franchise, and chartered powers and privileges [of a railroad company] is made, * * * the directors or managers of the sold-out company, at the time of the sale, * * * shall be the trustees of the creditors and stockholders of the sold-out company, and shall have full power to settle the affairs of the sold-out company, collect and pay the outstanding debts, and divide among the stockholders the money and property remaining in their hands after the payment of the debts and necessary expenses; and the persons so constituted trustees shall have the authority to sue by the name of the trustees of such sold-out company, and may be sued as such, and shall be jointly and severally responsible to the creditors and stockholders of such company to the extent of the property and effects which shall come into their hands; and no suit pending for or against any railroad company at the time the sale may be made of its road-bed, track, franchise, and chartered privileges shall abate, but the same shall be continued in the name of the trustees of the sold-out company.'

Flint and others, all citizens of Texas, who were directors of the Waco Tap Company at the time of the sale of the road-bed, etc., brought in as defendants. In this last amended petition, Shirley describes himself as at that time a citizen of New York. Citations were issued to the individual defendants on the eighteenth of April, 1882, requiring them to appear and answer on the first Monday in May. At the appointed time they all appeared and filed a demurrer. On the twentieth of May they filed a petition, accompanied with the necessary security, for the removal of the cause to the circuit court of the United States for the Northern district of Texas. In the petition it is stated that the individual defendants were, at the time the suit was commenced against them, and still continued to be, citizens of Texas, and Shirely a citizen of New York, and 'that the main and essential controversy in this case is between the said plaintiff and the said trustees, John T. Flint <i>et al.</i>, principal petitioners herein.' The Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad Company united in the petition, alleging 'that this suit or action, as against it, is purely incidental and collateral to, and wholly depends upon, the plaintiff's right to recover in his said suit or action against its co-defendants herein, the said John T. Flint <i>et al.</i>, trustees of the said sold-out company, * * * for damages for breach of contract by said sold-out company, now represented by said Flint <i>et al.</i>, trustees.' The cause was docketed in the circuit court on the second of October, 1882, and on the sixth a motion was made to remand.

Long after this time had elapsed the railroad company filed an answer to an amended petition and actually went to trial in the state court. This trial resulted in another judgment against the company, which was also reversed by the supreme court, and the case sent back for another trial.
