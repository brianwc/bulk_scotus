On the 8th of March the complainant filed a motion to modify the amount of the appeal bond. On the 8th of June, while this motion was pending, the complainant filed with the clerk of the Circuit Court an appeal bond dated March 1, 1886, in the penal sum of $25,000, which had been approved by the District Judge as a supersedeas bond. On the 2d of October the motion to modify the amount of the appeal bond was overruled by the court, \"on the ground that the case was then in the Supreme Court of the United States.\" The case was docketed in this court October 15, 1886.
