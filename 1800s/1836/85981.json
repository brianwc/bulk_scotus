On the 14th of the same month, the application was granted by the lieutenant-governor, with directions to make the survey, and put the party into possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant or commission was proved to have been in the handwriting of the surveyor-general; the signature of the lieutenant-governor was also proved to be genuine.

In the evidence given in that case it was established, that Mr Choteau had erected a distillery on the tract granted to him in 1800, as early as 1796; which was occupied and in operation from that time until the date of the grant: after obtaining which he enlarged and continued the establishment at the same place. It is therefore perfectly consistent with the date of Mackey's application, that he should refer to land in the occupation and actual possession of Choteau; though he had not at the time any grant or order of survey. The record in the present case also shows that the court below have considered this subject, and did not think the reference to Choteau's land was such evidence of fraud or antedating of the grant, as to make it their duty to prevent it from being used as evidence of title to the land claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final decree was rendered on the 15th of January 1830.

It would be assuming much in this case, for this court to decide, as a matter of fact, that the grant was fraudulent and void: the proof of the signature to and the handwriting of the grant is positive and uncontradicted: and the reference to Choteau's land, before the date of the grant to him, is accounted for. We therefore are of opinion that the grant was genuine, and that the title of the petitioners derived therefrom is valid by the law of nations, of the United States, of Spain; under whose government the claim originated; and by the stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States; and ought to be confirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court, that the decree of the district court be, and the same is hereby reversed; and proceeding to render such decree as the said district court ought to have rendered; it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the title of the petitioners to the land described in their petition to the district court, is valid by the laws and treaty aforesaid, and the same is hereby confirmed as therein described: and that the surveyor of public lands in Missouri be, and he is hereby directed to survey the quantity of land claimed in the place described in the petition and grant, or concession; that he deliver to the petitioners a copy or plot of such survey, and also do and perform such other acts and things therein, as by law are directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>35 U.S. 261 (____)</b></center>\n<center><b>10 Pet. 261</b></center>\n<center><h1>*ISABELLA MACKEY, WIDOW, JOHN ZENON MACKEY AND OTHERS, HEIRS OF JAMES MACKEY, APPELLANTS,<br>\nv.<br>\nTHE UNITED STATES.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>It was argued by Mr. White, for the appellants; and by Mr. Butler, attorney-general, for the United States.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice BALDWIN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from the decree of the district court of Missouri, rejecting the claim of the appellants to eight hundred arpents of land in that state; for the confirmation of which they had filed their petition, pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1824, for the adjustment of land claims in that state.</p>\n<p>The petition was in the form prescribed by the law, presenting a proper case for the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p>The claim of the petitioners was founded on an application by James Mackey, to the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, on the 13th of September, 1799; for a grant of eight hundred arpents of land, at a place therein particularly described.
