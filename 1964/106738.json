Petitioners argue that the proceedings they had instituted in the District Court must be regarded as a continuation of the original suit brought by the United States, that the United States is a 'party' to the action within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2107 and Rule 73(a), and, therefore, all the parties have 60 days from the entry of judgment to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in granting rehearing does not pass on the merits of these contentions, leaving them for consideration by the Court of Appeals.

First, it was not altogether clear whether review in this type of action should be sought in the Court of Appeals or directly in this Court under &#167; 2 of the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 29. To avoid being impaled upon the horns of this procedural dilemma, petitioners attempted to pursue both routes. We have now clarified the law and held that the Expediting Act was inapplicable and that review should proceed through the Court of Appeals. 375 U.S. 39, 84 S.Ct. 8. Second, even if the first question had not been beset by uncertainties, it was not clearly settled whether, in proceeding to the Court of Appeals, petitioners' case would come within the 60-day, as opposed to the 30-day, appeal limitation. Under these circumstances, given the prior complexities and our decision that the case is one to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, we should now issue an order which will insure that petitioners' right to appellate review is properly safeguarded.

Here, as in the cited decisions, we have a case in which, as a result of uncertainties in federal appellate procedures and without unreasonable action by petitioners, it is conceivable under the Court's modified opinion that an appellate review of the merits of the case may not only be unnecessarily delayed but even ultimately thwarted.
