While the Railroad Company was described in the writ as a corporation 'operated and controlled by the United States Railroad Administration,' the writ was directed to, and served upon, the Railroad Company alone, and the declaration was filed against it alone; no effort being then made to sue the Director General.

An order of notice was then served upon Davis, who appeared specially, and moved that such service be set aside and the action against him dismissed, on the grounds that the service was void and the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action against him, because the proceeding against him had not been instituted within the time prescribed by section 206 of the Transportation Act; and that any provisions of the Massachusetts laws purporting to authorize such proceeding were repugnant to the Transportation Act and void.

The Railroad Company was not liable for the cause of action that had arisen during Federal Control; the sole liability being that of the Director General as the representative of the Government. Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554, 557, 41 S. Ct. 593, 65 L. Ed. 1087. The original suit against the Railroad Company was not a suit against the Director General, and the service of the original writ upon the Railroad Company did not bring him before the court. While originally, after the passage of the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, &#167;&#167; 31153/4 a-3115 3/4p), it was sometimes thought that the Government might be held liable in a suit brought against the carrier, describing it as in the hands or possession of the Director General, all doubt as to how the suit should be brought was cleared away by the General Order of the Director General requiring that it should be brought against the Director General of Railroads, and not otherwise. Ault Case, supra, p. 561 (1921).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> And it is immaterial that, as admitted at bar, the service of the writ against the Railroad Company was made upon a clerk upon whom process against the Director General might have been served if the suit had been brought against him. 'The Federal Agent was not bound to take cognizance of an action against the railroad corporation, even though the service was on the same local station agent, and even though the complaint stated a cause of action for personal injuries sustained during government control.'

It further provided, in section 206(a), that suits and proceedings based on causes of action arising out of the possession, use and operation of a railroad under Federal Control, of such character as prior thereto could have been brought against the railroad company, might, after the termination of Federal Control, he brought against an Agent designated by the President for such purpose, 'but not later than two years from the date of the passage of this Act.' It also provided, in section 206(d), that actions of the character above described, pending at the termination of Federal Control, should not abate by reason of such termination, but might be prosecuted to final judgment, substituting the Agent designated by the President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the termination of Federal Control there was no suit pending against the Director General to enforce the liability of the Government. The amendment of the writ and declaration in the suit against the Railroad Company, in October, 1922, by substituting the designated Agent as the defendant, was, in effect, the commencement of a new and independent proceeding to enforce this liability. Being commenced more than two years after the passage of the Transportation Act, it was repugnant to the provision of section 206(a) requiring such an action to be instituted not later than two years after the passage of the Act. This was the only consent the Government had given to being sued in such an action after the termination of Federal Control. Nor was this amendment authorized under section 206(d), which related solely to the substitution of the designated Agent as the defendant in a suit which had been previously brought against the Director General to enforce the liability of the Government, that is, merely authorized the substitution, in such a suit, of another Federal Agent for the one already before the court. It had no application to suits pending against a railroad company alone in which there was no Federal Agent for whom the designated Agent could be substituted, where the substitution of the designated Agent for the railroad company would work an entire change in the cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These conclusions, we may add, are substantially the same as those of the State courts in Fahey v.

Nor was this amendment authorized under § 206(d), which related solely to the substitution of the designated Agent as the defendant in a suit which had been previously brought against the Director General to enforce the liability of the Government, that is, merely authorized the substitution, in such a suit, of another Federal agent for the one already before the court. It had no application to suits pending against a railroad company alone in which there was no Federal agent for whom the designated Agent could be substituted, where the substitution of the designated Agent for the railroad company would work an entire change in the cause of action.</p>\n<p>These conclusions, we may add, are substantially the same as those of the State courts in <i>Fahey</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 224 Mich. 371; <i>Fischer</i> v. <i>Wabash Railway,</i> 235 N.Y. 568; <i>Currie</i> v. <i>Louisville &amp; Nash. Railroad,</i> 206 Ala. 402; <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Chrisp,</i> 159 Ark., <i>supra;</i> and <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Industrial Commission</i> (Ill.), 146 N.E. 569.</p>\n<p>It results that the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws under which the plaintiff was allowed to amend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*643</span> the writ and declaration so as to substitute the designated Agent as the defendant instead of the Railroad Company, as construed and applied in the present case, are void because of repugnancy to § 206 of the Transportation Act.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Act of Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456.</p>\n<p>[2]  See General Order No. 50 of the Director General, Oct. 28, 1918; amended by General Order No. 50-A, Jan. 11, 1919.
