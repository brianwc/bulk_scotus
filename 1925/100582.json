The following statement from the opinion of that court (287 F. 158, 159) sufficiently indicates the material issues:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'On March 3, 1921, in the District Court of the United States      for the Southern District of New York, was filed a creditors'      bill against Imbrie &amp; Co., stock and bond dealers and      brokers, citizens of New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts,      whose principal place of business was New York. Receivers      were appointed. On the same day, in the superior court of      Fulton county, Ga., other creditors, citizens of Georgia,      sought and obtained a receiver for assets of Imbrie &amp; Co. in      Georgia connected with a branch office operated in Atlanta.      On March 7, 1921, the New York receivers, by direction of the      New York court, applied for ancillary receivership in this      court and were, with the state court receiver, made such      ancillary receivers. On March 8th, Imbrie &amp; Co. removed to this court the case in the Fulton      superior court. The two proceedings were then consolidated by      consent, and numerous interventions have been allowed in this      court, among them that of I. S. Hozier. His claim, in brief,      is that he gave Imbrie &amp; Co. in Atlanta, on February 21,      1921, a check for $2,656.13, to be used as his brokers in      buying certain stocks; that Imbrie &amp; Co. deposited it to      their credit in Fulton National Bank on February 23d; that      the proceeds of its collection were still to the credit of      Imbrie &amp; Co. at said bank, though in equity belonging to      Hozier, when the firm failed without having bought the stock,      whereupon Fulton National Bank, on March 3d, offset certain      notes it held against Imbrie &amp; Co. against the deposit,      absorbing it. Hozier prays that the bank be made a party and      be required to pay the $2,656.13 to the receivers or to him.      By an amendment he asks also a judgment against the estate in      the receivers' hands, with a first lien or otherwise, if the      bank could not be required to repay the money to them for      him. This intervention was allowed, the bank was made a party      and the issues made by answers to the intervention referred      to a master. Exceptions to his report raise three principal      questions: First, has this court, as a federal court,      jurisdiction of this controversy; second, should it pass upon      it, or remand the parties to the primary jurisdiction in New      York; third, on the merits has the bank the right to make the      set-off as against Hozier.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the intervention petition as a dependent controversy, and decreed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the receivers in the above-stated consolidated cause      recover from the Fulton National Bank of Atlanta the      principal sum of twenty-six hundred fifty-six and 13/100      dollars ($2,656.13), together with interest at the rate of      seven per cent. (7%) per annum from the date of this      judgment, and upon the recovery of same, that said receivers pay said amount to I. S.

The cause is here by certiorari. It is insisted that the trial court erred (1) in assuming jurisdiction of the intervention petition; and (2) in holding the bank liable for the amount of the deposited check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that in no proper sense was the petition dependent or ancillary to the cause instituted for the purpose of administering the assets of Imbrie &amp; Co. Consequently, the trial court could not entertain it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule is that, when a federal court has properly acquired jurisdiction over a cause, it may entertain, by intervention, dependent or ancillary controversies; but no controversy can be regarded as dependent or ancillary unless it has direct relation to property or assets actually or constructively drawn into the court's possession or control by the principal suit.

Ed. 693; Union Stockyards Bank v. Gillespie, supra. There were no funds in the receivers' possession and none subject to their demand as to which Hozier asserted any right; his claim was against something in the bank's possession and beyond the receivers' reach. His petition sought to compel them to litigate with the bank for his sole interest and without possibility of benefit to the estate. As shown by the decree quoted above, the expected fruit of the litigation was for petitioner alone. He had no right to bring the bank, which for jurisdictional purposes was to be deemed a citizen of Georgia (Judicial Code, &#167; 24, subd. 16 [Comp. St. &#167; 991]), into the federal court, or to interfere with the affairs of the estate by injecting this controversy concerning which the receivers had no material interest&#8212;wherein the estate might lose much, but could gain nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree is reversed.
