Argued November 3, 2008—Decided February 24, 2009\nIdaho’s Right to Work Act permits public employees to authorize pay\n  roll deductions for general union dues, but prohibits such deductions\n  for union political activities. Respondents—a group of Idaho public\n  employee unions—sued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions\n  for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amend\n  ments. The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but\n  struck it down as it applies to local governments. In affirming, the\n  Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over\n  local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their\n  payroll deduction systems. The court applied strict scrutiny to hold\n  that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.\nHeld: Idaho’s ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local\n governmental units, does not infringe the unions’ First Amendment\n rights. Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) Content-based restrictions on speech are “presumptively inva\n lid” and subject to strict scrutiny. Davenport v. Washington Ed.\n Assn., 551 U. S. 177, ___. The First Amendment does not, however,\n impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech. See Regan\n v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549. Idaho’s\n law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote\n that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activi\n ties. Idaho’s public employee unions are free to engage in such\n speech as they see fit. They simply are barred from enlisting the\n State in support of that endeavor. Idaho’s decision to limit public\n employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions’\n First Amendment rights. The State accordingly need only demon\n strate a rational basis to justify the ban. Idaho’s justification is the\n2                  YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favorit\n    ism or entanglement with partisan politics. See, e.g., Civil Service\n    Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565. And the State’s re\n    sponse to the problem is limited to its source—political payroll deduc\n    tions. Cf. Davenport, supra. The ban plainly serves the State’s inter\n    est in separating public employment from political activities. Pp. 5–\n    8.\n       (b) The ban at issue is valid at the local level. The same deferential\n    review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local govern\n    mental entities. Political subdivisions have never been considered\n    sovereign entities but are instead “subordinate governmental in\n    strumentalities.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575. The State’s\n    legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it\n    is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart\n    of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies de\n    pending on the level of government affected. The ban furthers\n    Idaho’s interest in separating the operation of government from par\n    tisan politics, and that interest extends to all public employers at\n    whatever level of government.

POCATELLO EDUCATION \n\n             ASSOCIATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Under Idaho law, a public employee may elect to have a\nportion of his wages deducted by his employer and remit\nted to his union to pay union dues. He may not, however,\nchoose to have an amount deducted and remitted to the\nunion’s political action committee, because Idaho law\nprohibits payroll deductions for political activities. A\ngroup of unions representing Idaho public employees\nchallenged this limitation. They conceded that the limita\ntion was valid as applied at the state level, but argued\nthat it violated their First Amendment rights when ap\nplied to county, municipal, school district, and other local\npublic employers.\n   We do not agree. The First Amendment prohibits gov\nernment from “abridging the freedom of speech”; it does\nnot confer an affirmative right to use government payroll\nmechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expres\nsion. Idaho’s law does not restrict political speech, but\nrather declines to promote that speech by allowing public\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployee checkoffs for political activities. Such a decision\nis reasonable in light of the State’s interest in avoiding the\nappearance that carrying out the public’s business is\ntainted by partisan political activity. That interest ex\ntends to government at the local as well as state level, and\nnothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from\ndetermining that its political subdivisions may not provide\npayroll deductions for political activities.\n                                I\n   Idaho’s Right to Work Act declares that the “right to\nwork shall not be infringed or restricted in any way based\non membership in, affiliation with, or financial support of\na labor organization or on refusal to join, affiliate with, or\nfinancially or otherwise support a labor organization.”\n1985 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 2, §1 (codified at Idaho Code\n§44–2001 (Michie 2003)). As part of that policy, the Act\nprohibits any requirement for the payment of dues or fees\nto a labor organization as a condition of employment, §44–\n2003, but authorizes employers to deduct union fees from\nan employee’s wages with the employee’s “signed written\nauthorization,” §44–2004(1). The Act covers all employ\nees, “including all employees of the state and its political\nsubdivisions.” §44–2011.\n   Prior to 2003, employees could authorize both a payroll\ndeduction for general union dues and a payroll deduction\nfor union political activities conducted through a political\naction committee. App. 55–56, 83–84. In 2003, the Idaho\nLegislature passed the Voluntary Contributions Act\n(VCA). 2003 Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho\nCode §§44–2601 through 44–2605, and §44–2004). That\nlegislation, among other things, amended the Right to\nWork Act by adding a prohibition on payroll deductions for\npolitical purposes. That amendment provides: “Deduc\ntions for political activities as defined in chapter 26, title\n44, Idaho Code, shall not be deducted from the wages,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Violations of\n§44–2004(2) are punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000\nor up to 90 days of imprisonment, or both. §44–2007.\n   Shortly before the VCA was to take effect, plaintiff labor\norganizations sued the Bannock County prosecuting at\ntorney, the Idaho secretary of state, and the Idaho attor\nney general in their official capacities, alleging that the\nban on political payroll deductions was unconstitutional\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. App. 18–41.1 The District\nCourt rejected that argument with respect to public em\nployers at the state level, concluding that the First\nAmendment does not compel the State “to subsidize\nspeech by providing, at its own expense, payroll deduc\ntions for the purpose of paying union dues or association\nfees for State employees.” Pocatello Ed.

The\n\n——————\n   1 The unions also challenged other provisions of the VCA, including\n\none requiring labor organizations to establish a “separate segregated\nfund” for political activities. Idaho Code §§44–2601 through 44–2605\n(Michie 2002); see App. 27–34. In response to that challenge, the State\nagreed to strike “all of the VCA except for its ban on political payroll\ndeductions.” Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Heideman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3241745</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (D\nIdaho, Nov. 23, 2005). The State asserted that the ban could be “given\neffect since it operates without reference to the existence of a separate\nsegregated fund.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The unions\ndo not dispute that the ban on political payroll deductions is severable\nfrom the other challenged provisions. Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum in\nSupport of Their Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to\nthe State Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, in No. Civ. 03–\n256–E–BLW (D Idaho, Aug. 15, 2005), p. 3 (hereinafter Plaintiffs’ Reply\nMemorandum).\n4              YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nban was valid at the state level because “the State is\nincurring costs to set up and maintain the [payroll deduc\ntion] program.” Ibid. The court struck down the VCA,\nhowever, “to the extent that it applies to local govern\nments and private employers,” because the State had\nfailed to identify any subsidy it provided to such employ\ners to administer payroll deductions. Id., at *2 (footnote\nomitted), *6.\n   The state defendants appealed, contending that the ban\non political payroll deductions may be constitutionally\napplied to local government employees. Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heideman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\nNeither party challenged the District Court’s rulings as to\nprivate and state-level employees, and therefore the only\nissue remaining concerned application of the ban to local\ngovernment employees.\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\nthat there was “no subsidy by the State of Idaho for the\npayroll deduction systems of local governments.” Id., at\n1059. The appellate court remarked that “the generalized\nlawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a\nstate’s political subdivisions does not establish that the\nstate is acting as a proprietor” with respect to local gov\nernment employers. Id., at 1064. The court instead re\ngarded the relationship between the State and its political\nsubdivisions as analogous to that between the State and a\nregulated private utility. See id., at 1063–1065 (citing\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980)). While “Idaho has the ulti\nmate power of control over the units of government at\nissue,” it did not “actually operat[e] or contro[l] the payroll\ndeduction systems of local units of government.” 504\nF. 3d, at 1068. The court therefore applied strict scrutiny\nto Idaho’s decision to prevent local government employers\nfrom allowing payroll deductions for political purposes,\nand held the statute unconstitutional as applied at the\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlocal level. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. __ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n    Restrictions on speech based on its content are “pre\nsumptively invalid” and subject to strict scrutiny. Daven\nport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 188 (2007);\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992). The unions\nassert that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls\ninto this category because the law singles out political\nspeech for disfavored treatment.\n    The First Amendment, however, protects the right to be\nfree from government abridgment of speech. While in\nsome contexts the government must accommodate expres\nsion, it is not required to assist others in funding the\nexpression of particular ideas, including political ones.\n“[A] legislature’s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a\nfundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is\nnot subject to strict scrutiny.” Regan v. Taxation With\nRepresentation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549 (1983); cf.\nSmith v. Highway Employees, 441 U. S. 463, 465 (1979)\n(per curiam) (“First Amendment does not impose any\naffirmative obligation on the government to listen, to\nrespond or, in this context, to recognize [a labor] associa\ntion and bargain with it”).\n    The court below concluded, and Idaho does not dispute,\nthat “unions face substantial difficulties in collecting\nfunds for political speech without using payroll deduc\ntions.” 504 F. 3d, at 1058. But the parties agree that the\nState is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll\ndeductions at all. See Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum 10;\nsee also Toledo Area AFL–CIO Council v. Pizza, 154 F. 3d\n307, 319–320 (CA6 1998); cf. Charlotte v. Firefighters, 426\nU. S. 283, 286 (1976) (“Court would reject . . . contention\n. . . that respondents’ status as union members or their\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest in obtaining a dues checkoff . . . entitle[s] them to\nspecial treatment under the Equal Protection Clause”).\nWhile publicly administered payroll deductions for politi\ncal purposes can enhance the unions’ exercise of First\nAmendment rights, Idaho is under no obligation to aid the\nunions in their political activities. And the State’s deci\nsion not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions’\nspeech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see\nfit. They simply are barred from enlisting the State in\nsupport of that endeavor. Idaho’s decision to limit public\nemployer payroll deductions as it has “is not subject to\nstrict scrutiny” under the First Amendment. Regan, 461\nU. S., at 549.\n   Given that the State has not infringed the unions’ First\nAmendment rights, the State need only demonstrate a\nrational basis to justify the ban on political payroll deduc\ntions. Id., at 546–551. The prohibition is not “aim[ed] at\nthe suppression of dangerous ideas,” id., at 548 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but is instead justified by the\nState’s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics. We have previously recognized such a purpose in\nupholding limitations on public employee political activi\nties. See Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413\nU. S. 548, 565 (1973) (public perception of partiality can\nundermine confidence in representative government);\nPublic Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 96–100 (1947)\n(Congress may limit political acts by public officials to\npromote integrity in the discharge of official duties); cf.\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473\nU. S. 788, 809 (1985) (limitations on speech may be justi\nfied by interest in “avoiding the appearance of political\nfavoritism”); Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828, 839 (1976)\n(upholding policy aimed at keeping official military activi\nties “wholly free of entanglement with partisan political\ncampaigns of any kind”).

S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npolitical speech similarly furthers the government’s inter\nest in distinguishing between internal governmental\noperations and private speech. Idaho’s decision to allow\npayroll deductions for some purposes but not for political\nactivities is plainly reasonable.2\n   Davenport guides our resolution here. That case also\ninvolved a distinction based on the content of speech:\nSpecific consent was required from nonunion members\nbefore agency fees charged to them could be used for elec\ntion-related activities, but consent was not required with\nrespect to agency fees used for other purposes. 551 U. S.,\nat 181–182. We rejected the unions’ argument that this\nrequirement violated the First Amendment because it\nturned on the content of the speech at issue. Id., at 188–\n190. We recognized that the statute, rather than sup\npressing union speech, simply declined to assist that\nspeech by granting the unions the right to charge agency\nfees for election activities. That decision was reasonable\n\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER finds this analysis inapplicable because the chal\n\nlenged provision removes politically related deductions from an existing\nsystem. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut available deductions do not have tenure; a legislature is free to\naddress concerns as they arise.\n  JUSTICE BREYER would also subject the ban to more exacting scrutiny\nby analogizing it to various direct restrictions on expression. See post,\nat 2–4. That analogy misses the mark. A decision not to assist fund\nraising that may, as a practical matter, result in fewer contributions is\nsimply not the same as directly limiting expression. Cf. Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983)\n(“Although [a union] does not have as much money as it wants, and\nthus cannot exercise its freedom of speech as much as it would like, the\nConstitution does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be\nnecessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). We therefore would not subject Idaho’s\nstatute to the “open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors” proposed by\nthe dissent as an alternative to rational basis review. Jerome B.\nGrubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547\n(1995); see post, at 4.\n8                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven the State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nelection process. Ibid. We also concluded that the State\ndid “not have to enact an across-the-board limitation . . . to\nvindicate [its] more narrow concern.” Id., at 189.\n   Here the restriction is on the use of a checkoff to fund\npolitical activities, but the same analysis governs. Idaho\ndoes not suppress political speech but simply declines to\npromote it through public employer checkoffs for political\nactivities. The concern that political payroll deductions\nmight be seen as involving public employers in politics\narises only because Idaho permits public employer payroll\ndeductions in the first place. As in Davenport, the State’s\nresponse to that problem is limited to its source—in this\ncase, political payroll deductions. The ban on such deduc\ntions plainly serves the State’s interest in separating\npublic employment from political activities.3\n——————\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER suggests that the ban on political payroll deduc\n\ntions may not be applied evenhandedly to all politically related deduc\ntions. Post, at 4–6 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nJUSTICE STEVENS goes further and would find the ban unconstitutional\nin all its applications as discriminatory. Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion).\nThe District Court, however, noted that the ban “is not viewpoint\nbased,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3241745</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3; the unions acknowledged in their Court\nof Appeals brief that they “have not attempted to establish that Section\n44–2004(2) is based on viewpoint discrimination,” Brief for Plaintiffs-\nAppellees in No. 06–35004 (CA9), p. 18, n. 13; and nothing in the\nQuestions Presented before this Court raised any issue of viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   The ban on political payroll deductions is by its terms not limited to\nany particular type of political contribution. Nothing in the record\nsuggests that public employers permit deductions for some political\nactivities but not for those of unions. Idaho’s attorney general—\ncharged with enforcing the ban—explicitly confirmed that it “applies to\nall organizations, to any deduction regarding political issues, applies\nregardless of viewpoint or message, applies to all employers, and it does\nnot single out any candidates or issues.” App. 110. If the ban is not\nenforced evenhandedly, plaintiffs are free to bring an as applied chal\nlenge. See National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 587\n(1998).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The unions abandoned their challenge to the\nrestriction at the state level, but contend that strict scru\ntiny is still warranted when the ban is applied to local\ngovernment employers. In that context, the unions argue,\nthe State is no longer declining to facilitate speech\nthrough its own payroll system, but is obstructing speech\nin the local governments’ payroll systems. See Brief for\nRespondents 44–46. We find that distinction unpersua\nsive, and hold that the same deferential review applies\nwhether the prohibition on payroll deductions for political\nspeech is directed at state or local governmental entities.\n  “Political subdivisions of States—counties, cities, or\nwhatever—never were and never have been considered as\nsovereign entities.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575\n(1964).    They are instead “subordinate governmental\ninstrumentalities created by the State to assist in the\ncarrying out of state governmental functions.” Ibid.; see\nalso Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v. Mayor and Administrators\nof New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, 287 (1883) (“Municipal\ncorporations are instrumentalities of the State for the\nconvenient administration of government within their\nlimits”). State political subdivisions are “merely . . . de\npartment[s] of the State, and the State may withhold,\ngrant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit.”\nTrenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). Here the\nIdaho Legislature has elected to withhold from all public\nemployers the power to provide payroll deductions for\npolitical activities.\n  The State’s legislative action is of course subject to First\nAmendment and other constitutional scrutiny whether\nthat action is applicable at the state level, the local level,\nboth, or some subpart of either. But we are aware of no\ncase suggesting that a different analysis applies under the\nFirst Amendment depending on the level of government\n10            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffected, and the unions have cited none. The ban on\npolitical payroll deductions furthers Idaho’s interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics. That interest extends to all public employers at\nwhatever level of government.\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Ap\npeals invoked our decision in Consolidated Edison Co. of\nN. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530. In\nthat case, we held that a state commission could not,\nconsistent with the First Amendment, prohibit a privately\nowned electric utility from discussing controversial issues\nin its bill inserts. Id., at 544. We ruled that the fact that\nthe State regulated the utility did not authorize the prohi\nbition. Id., at 540. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe same analysis applied here, and that “the State’s\nbroad powers of control over local government entities are\nsolely those of a regulator, analogous to the [state commis\nsion’s] regulatory power over [the private utility].” 504\nF. 3d, at 1065.\n  That analogy is misguided. A private corporation is\nsubject to the government’s legal authority to regulate its\nconduct. A political subdivision, on the other hand, is a\nsubordinate unit of government created by the State to\ncarry out delegated governmental functions. A private\ncorporation enjoys constitutional protections, see First\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14\n(1978), but a political subdivision, “created by the state for\nthe better ordering of government, has no privileges or\nimmunities under the federal constitution which it may\ninvoke in opposition to the will of its creator.” Williams v.\nMayor of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, 40 (1933); see Trenton v.\nNew Jersey, supra, at 185 (municipality, as successor to a\nprivate water company, does not enjoy against the State\nthe same constitutional rights as the water company:\n“[T]he relations existing between the State and the water\ncompany were not the same as those between the State\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Given the\nrelationship between the State and its political subdivi\nsions, however, it is immaterial how the State allocates\nfunding or management responsibilities between the\ndifferent levels of government.

The\nsole question posed for this Court’s decision is the appro\npriate placement of the State’s political subdivisions: For\nthe purpose at hand, should the Court align local\ngovernment employment with private-sector employment\nor with state-level employment?\n  “Given the relationship between the State and its politi\ncal subdivisions,” the Court persuasively explains, “it is\nimmaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment.” Ante, at 11.

See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575 (1964).\nHence the fact that a state statute, rather than a munici\npal ordinance, limits the use of the municipality’s payroll\ndeduction system is beside the point. I agree that this is\nso, and I agree with JUSTICE SOUTER’s discussion about\nthe relationship between the state and the municipality.\n  I do not agree, however, with the Court’s further analy\nsis of the pertinent legal question—whether the state\nstatute violates the First Amendment. Nor do I agree\nwith its ultimate conclusion. Rather, in my view, we\nshould remand this case for further consideration.\n    The Court’s First Amendment analysis emphasizes its\ncharacterization of the statute as not “abridging” a union’s\nor a worker’s “freedom of speech,” but rather “declin[ing]\nto promote” that speech. Ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I agree that the First Amendment does\nnot prohibit government from “declining to promote”\nspeech. It says that government shall not “abridg[e] the\nfreedom of speech.” (Emphasis added) . But I do not think\nthe distinction particularly useful in this case.\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    That is because here the distinction is neither easy to\ndraw nor likely to prove determinative. Sometimes, I\nconcede, the distinction may help. Were there no payroll\ndeduction system at all and were the unions arguing for\nthe creation of such a system from scratch, one might\ncharacterize their claim as seeking the promotion of\nspeech. But that is not the situation here. A deduction\nsystem already exists. The unions attack a separate\nstatutory provision that removes politically related deduc\ntions from that system. And linguistically speaking, one\nneed not characterize such an attack as (1) seeking speech\npromotion rather than (2) seeking to prevent an abridg\nment of political-speech-related activity that otherwise\n(i.e., in the absence of the exception) would occur. In such\nan instance, the debate over characterization is more\nmetaphysical than practical.\n     More importantly, the characterization quite possibly\ndoes not matter.        Suppose, for example, a somewhat\nsimilar statutory exception picks and chooses among\npolitical causes, prohibiting deductions that help one\npolitical party while permitting deductions that help\nanother. The First Amendment result could not turn upon\nwhether one described the exception as an “abridgment” or\na “promotion” failure. And, as I shall explain, infra, at 5–\n6, such may be the case here.\n     I disagree with the Court’s characterizations in an\nother respect. The Court says that because the exception\n“has not infringed the unions’ First Amendment rights,”\n“strict scrutiny” does not apply and, thus, the State “need\nonly demonstrate a rational basis”—the standard of re\nview applicable to any ordinary legislation that does not\ninfringe fundamental rights—“to justify the ban on politi\ncal payroll deductions.” Ante, at 6 (emphasis added). I\nagree that the exception does not call for “strict scru\ntiny”—a categorization that almost always proves fatal to\nthe law in question. After all, the exception does not\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The exception\naffects speech, albeit indirectly, by restricting a channel\nthrough which speech-supporting finance might flow. As a\nresult, the alternative to “strict scrutiny” is not necessarily\na form of “rational basis” review—a test that almost every\nrestriction will pass. And instead of applying either “strict\nscrutiny” or “rational basis” review to the statutory excep\ntion, I would ask the question that this Court has asked in\nother speech-related contexts, namely whether the statute\nimposes a burden upon speech that is disproportionate in\nlight of the other interests the government seeks to\nachieve.

In doing so, it has considered the\nseriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will\nlikely cause, the importance of the provision’s countervail\ning objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to\nachieve those objectives, and whether there are other less\nrestrictive ways of doing so. In light of these considera\ntions, it has determined whether ultimately the statute\nworks speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its\njustifications. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (describing need for a “fit”\nbetween legislative ends and means “whose scope is ‘in\nproportion to the interest served’ ”); United States v.\nAmerican Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 217–218\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n    Where context calls for “strict scrutiny,” one would not\nnecessarily ask these proportionality questions; but I\nwould ask them in other contexts calling for less than\nordinary legislative leeway in light of the fact that consti\ntutionally protected expression is at issue. See id., at 218.\nTo do so, in my view, helps structure what the Court\nsometimes calls an “intermediate scrutiny” inquiry. See\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622\n(1994).\n   Applying this analysis here, I would find the statutory\nexception constitutional, but only if I were convinced that\nthe exception applied even handedly among similar politi\ncally related contributions. If so, the provision would still\nnegatively affect speech-related interests, for it would\nclose off one channel through which individuals might\nprovide speech-enabling funds to political institutions.\nBut, as the majority points out, many other channels for\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

I\nwould consequently find the restriction justified as propor\ntionately serving a legitimate, important governmental\nneed. Cf. Fox, supra, at 480.\n    It is not clear, however, whether the particular excep\ntion before us does, in fact, operate even handedly. To\nread the statute without more, I concede, suggests even\nhandedness. The provision says that “[d]eductions for\npolitical activities as defined in chapter 26, title 44, Idaho\nCode, shall not be deducted from wages, earnings or com\npensation of an employee.” Idaho Code Ann. §44–2004(2)\n(Michie 2003) (emphasis added). And chapter 26, title 44,\nIdaho Code, defines “political activities” without special\nreference to labor organizations. See §44–2602(e).\n   Nonetheless, certain features of the provision suggest it\nmay affect some politically-related deductions, namely\nlabor-related deductions, but not others. Title 44 of the\nIdaho Code—entitled “Labor”—is about labor activities.\nAnd the ban on payroll deductions for political activities\nwas enacted as part of a statute in which every other pro\nvision is concerned solely with union activities. See Vol\nuntary Contributions Act, 2003 Idaho Sess. Laws chs. 97\nand 340 (codified at Idaho Code Ann. §§44–2601 through\n44–2605 and §44–2004). At the same time, the provision\ncontaining the payroll deduction ban is immediately fol\nlowed by another related provision that expressly men\ntions labor unions. See §44–2004(3) (“Nothing in this\nchapter shall prohibit an employee from personally paying\ncontributions for political activities . . . to a labor organiza\ntion unless such payment is prohibited by law” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   It is important to know whether the exception concerns\nonly labor-related political deductions (while allowing\nother similar deductions) or treats all alike. A restriction\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat applies to the political activities of unions alone\nwould seem unlikely to further the government’s justifying\nobjective, namely providing the appearance of political\nneutrality. And in that case, the provision could well\nbring about speech-related harm that is disproportionate\nto the statute’s tendency to further the government’s\n“neutrality” objective.\n   Because the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue as if\nthe State “regulated” its municipalities (as government\nmight regulate a private firm), it did not resolve the ques\ntions I have just described. I would remand the case so\nthat it can decide whether the parties appropriately raised\nthose matters and, if so, consider them. Accordingly, I\nwould vacate the Court of Appeals’ decision and remand\nthe case.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

In 2003, however, the State\nenacted the Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA), 2003\nSess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code §44–\n2004, and §§44–2601 through 44–2605 (Michie 2003)),\nwhich, among other things, prohibits employers from\nallowing any payroll deduction for “political activities,”\n§44–2004(2). For several reasons, I cannot conclude as the\nCourt does that this restriction on payroll deductions was\nreasonably calculated to further the State’s “interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics,” ante, at 10. Because it is clear to me that the\nrestriction was intended to make it more difficult for\nunions to finance political speech, I would hold it unconsti\ntutional in all its applications.\n                             I\n  “It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate\nspeech based on its substantive content or the message it\nconveys.” Rosenberger v.

On its face, §44–2004(2)\nrestricts payroll deductions for all political activities, and\npetitioners contend that the State reasonably enacted\n§44–2004(2) “to avoid either the appearance or the reality\nof public employer involvement in . . . electoral politics.”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15. Several features of the statute, how\never, belie its purported viewpoint neutrality.\n   That the restriction was more narrowly intended to\ntarget union fundraising is first evidenced by its statutory\ncontext. The other provisions of the VCA with which §44–\n2004(2) was enacted pertain exclusively to unions.1 For\ninstance, §44–2603 requires unions to create separate\nfunds for political activities and places restrictions on\nunions’ solicitation of political contributions; §44–2604\nmakes it a misdemeanor, among other things, for unions\nto make expenditures for political activities from union\ndues; and §44–2605 establishes registration and reporting\nrequirements for union political funds. The provisions\nproximate to §44–2004(2), which were enacted roughly two\ndecades earlier as part of the Right to Work Act, 1985\nSess. Laws ch. 2, §1 (codified at Idaho Code §44–2001 et\nseq.), are similarly directed at union activities. Even the\nsubsection immediately preceding §44–2004(2) is aimed\nspecifically at unions: §44–2004(1) prohibits payroll deduc\ntions for union dues, fees, assessments, or other charges\nwithout an employee’s prior written authorization. And,\nfinally, §44–2004(2) is codified in a title of the Idaho Code\nentitled “Labor” and in a chapter entitled “Right to Work.”\nTogether, these statutory features strongly suggest that\nthe Idaho Legislature enacted §44–2004(2) specifically to\nimpede union fundraising.\n——————\n   1 Respondents also challenged these provisions of the VCA, and peti\n\ntioners conceded their invalidity earlier in this litigation, acknowledg\ning that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of\nlabor organizations to solicit political contributions.

Petitioners contend that the\nrestriction was enacted to further the State’s interest in\navoiding the appearance or actuality of public employer\ninvolvement in partisan politics. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.\nBut, as enacted, §44–2004(2) prohibited private as well as\npublic employers from making payroll deductions for\npolitical activities. As petitioners admitted at oral argu\nment, “the State has no interest in . . . private employers’\ndetermination to be involved or not involved in political\nmatters.” Id., at 6. That petitioners conceded the invalid\nity of §44–2004(2) as applied to private employers earlier\nin this litigation does not require us to ignore the breadth\nof the statute the State enacted in assessing the provi\nsion’s scope and purpose. Consideration of the provision\nactually passed by the legislature makes clear that the\nState’s asserted interest in the restriction is not compati\nble with its breadth.\n   The State’s interest in avoiding the appearance or real\nity of employer political involvement is also inconsistent\nwith its decision not to restrict deductions for charitable\nactivities. Such deductions will often present a similar\nrisk of creating an appearance of political involvement as\ndeductions for covered political activities. Yet the State\nhas made no effort to distinguish this type of political\nactivity. As with the State’s decision to apply §44–2004(2)\nto private employers, its failure to apply the restriction to\ncharitable deductions produces a significant mismatch\nbetween the restriction’s reach and its asserted purpose.\n   To my mind, it is clear from these features of the legisla\ntion that §44–2004(2)’s prohibition on payroll deductions\nfor “political activities” was intended to target union po\nlitical activity.

The Court of Appeals found this application of\nthe provision invalid due to the State’s failure to show that\nit “actually operates or controls the payroll deduction\nsystems of local units of government.” Pocatello Ed. Assn.\n——————\n    2 It\n       may even be true that §44–2004(2) only affects union political\nactivity, as petitioners can point to no evidence that another entity is\naffected by the statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. But it is unnecessary to\ndetermine whether other entities are actually affected by the restriction\nin light of its clearly discriminatory purpose.\n   3 The discriminatory nature of §44–2004(2) distinguishes it from the\n\nrestriction we upheld in Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S.\n177 (2007)—a decision on which the majority heavily relies. In that\ncase, state law authorized public-sector unions to charge nonmembers\nan agency fee equivalent to membership dues and to have employers\ncollect that fee through payroll deductions. Respondent challenged the\nvalidity of a state ballot initiative requiring public-sector unions to\nobtain nonmembers’ affirmative authorization before using their fees\nfor political purposes. We held that the affirmative-authorization\nprovision did not violate respondent’s First Amendment rights because\nit merely placed a viewpoint-neutral limitation on an “extraordinary”\nstate-law entitlement allowing it to collect and spend the money of\ngovernment employees. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 10). By contrast,\n§44–2004(2) is not a limitation on a state-law entitlement that specifi\ncally benefits unions but rather a union-specific exclusion from a\ngenerally available benefit.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2007).4 In the\nabsence of evidence of such control, the Court of Appeals\nheld, “the State has a relatively weak interest in prevent\ning [respondents] from exercising their First Amendment\nrights.” Ibid.\n    Unlike the Court of Appeals, the majority omits any\nexamination of the relationship Idaho has established\nwith its political subdivisions. Rather, the majority finds\nit sufficient to assert that States, as the creators of local\ngovernment, retain the authority to grant or withdraw\nsubdivision powers and privileges. Ante, at 8. The fact of\nthat authority, however, hardly proves that the particular\nrelationship between a State and its political subdivisions\nis irrelevant to our constitutional inquiry. All States do\nnot treat their subdivisions the same, and those differ\nences are sometimes consequential.\n    We have in other contexts recognized the constitutional\nsignificance of the relationship a State chooses to establish\nwith its political subdivisions. For instance, in Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977),\nwe stated that the answer to the question whether a\nschool board should “be treated as an arm of the State\npartaking of the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity\n. . . depends, at least in part, upon the nature of the entity\ncreated by state law.” And in McMillian v. Monroe\nCounty, 520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997), we held that whether a\nsheriff has county or state policymaking authority for\npurposes of determining liability under Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983 is ascertained by reference to “the actual\nfunction of a government official,” which is in turn “de\npendent on the definition of the official’s functions under\nrelevant state law.” In both cases, the constitutional\n——————\n  4 The State conceded at oral argument before the Court of Appeals\n\nthat it is not the proprietor of local government workplaces or their\npayroll deduction programs. See 504 F. 3d, at 1065.\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis turned in part on the way the State had struc\ntured its relationship with its political subdivisions.\n   Although we have not previously considered the impli\ncations of the state-subdivision relationship in the First\nAmendment context, we have repeatedly recognized the\nsignificance of an analogous inquiry: whether the govern\nment, in imposing speech restrictions, is acting in its\ncapacity as regulator or proprietor. See, e.g., Davenport v.\nWashington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, at ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 9–10); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 805–806 (1985). Accordingly, I\ncannot agree with the majority’s assertion that, because\npolitical subdivisions are instrumentalities of the State, “it\nis immaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment,” ante, at 11. Relationships between state and\nlocal governments are more varied, and the consequences\nof that variation are more significant, than the majority’s\nanalysis admits.\n   Because my conclusion that §44–2004(2) discriminates\nagainst labor organizations is sufficient to decide this case,\nI find it unnecessary to fully consider the implications of\nIdaho’s relationship with its political subdivisions.\nRather, I note the significance of this relationship to urge\nits careful consideration in future cases.\n                               III\n  The majority avoids acknowledging §44–2004(2)’s evi\ndently discriminatory purpose only by examining the\nstatute out of context and ignoring its initial applicability\nto private employers. Considering the provision as en\nacted, I cannot find it justified as the majority does by “the\nState’s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics,” ante, at 6.

So far as\nIdaho’s law affects freedom of expression, I am not per\nsuaded there is sufficient reason to treat the State’s statu\ntory prohibition differently depending on the unit of its\ngovernment employing the worker whose salary deduction\nwould fund political activity. There is no question in this\ncase that the lower echelons of Idaho government are\ncreatures of the State exercising state power in discharg\ning what are ultimately state responsibilities. Nor is there\nany apparent reason to think the State’s asserted legiti\nmate interest differs according to the level of government\ndoing the State’s work, whether that interest is having a\nfirewall between public administration and politics or\nsimply exercising a power to decide whether public em\nployees who administer payrolls should spend work time\nadvancing private political speech.\n   But I find it impossible to stop there. Although this case\ncomes to us as one about the scope of the public business\nthe State is free, within reasonable limits, to manage as it\nthinks wise, the specter of another First Amendment\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncategory, one of superior significance, is too insistent to\nignore. It is true that government may choose to manage\nits own affairs in ways that draw reasonable subject\nmatter lines affecting speech, being free, for example, to\nsell space on its buses for advertising soap but not politi\ncians. See Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298\n(1974). But a government is not free to draw those lines\nas a way to discourage or suppress the expression of view\npoints it disagrees with, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal De\nfense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806, 811–812,\n(1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 46, 49 (1983); only narrow tailoring to serve\na compelling state interest could justify that kind of selec\ntivity, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,\nInc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000).\n   This difference between viewpoint discrimination and\nneutral regulation of governmental activity is on point in\nthis case. For although the State invokes its legitimate\ninterest in keeping public administration free from politi\ncal involvement as its reason for Idaho Code §44–2004(2)\n(Michie 2003), this ostensibly viewpoint-neutral rationale\nsuffers from the circumstances JUSTICE STEVENS describes\nin detail, see ante, at 2–4 (dissenting opinion). Every\nother provision of the amendatory act in which §44–\n2004(2) was included deals with unions, the statute\namended regulates unions, and all this legislation is\nplaced in the State’s labor law codification. Ante., at 2.\nUnion speech, and nothing else, seems to have been on the\nlegislative mind.\n   The Court’s answer to this recalls Davenport v. Wash\nington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177 (2007), in suggesting that\nIdaho was merely limiting a self-created risk of entangling\npublic administration with politics, which followed from\nauthorizing public payroll deductions for union benefit in\nthe first place, ante, at 7–8. But the scope of the state\nenactment that imposes the prohibition places that expla\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nnation in question, for the statute goes beyond constrain\ning the government as employer, and criminalizes deduc\ntions for political purposes even when administered by\nprivate employers, an application of the law the State\nconcedes is unconstitutional. Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Hei\ndeman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007). Hence a reader\nof the statute may fairly suspect that Idaho’s legislative\nobject was not efficient, clean government, but that un\nions’ political viewpoints were its target, selected out of all\nthe politics the State might filter from its public work\nplaces.\n   What to do about this reasonable suspicion of viewpoint\ndiscrimination is a dilemma. We can hardly disregard it,\nfor it affects the weight this case can carry as precedent; a\ndecision that ignores the elephant in the room is a decision\nwith diminished authority. But the potential issue of\nviewpoint discrimination that should be addressed in this\ncase is not before us. Although the unions’ brief alludes to\nviewpoint discrimination in several places, that is not the\nfocus of their argument. The unions, instead, aim at\nshowing that the State is acting as a regulator of local\ngovernments (much as it regulates private corporations),\nnot as a manager setting limits to what government will\ndo with public resources; consequently they rest their\nposition on the argument that any state discrimination\nagainst political speech is illegitimate, however consis\ntently all shades of political speech may be treated. And\neven if we could properly recast the case by remanding to\nconsider viewpoint discrimination, see Cornelius, supra, at\n811–812, a remand could only affect the application of the\nstatute to subordinate units of government; the unions\nhave accepted the constitutionality of applying the law to\nthe State, where an effort at viewpoint discrimination\nwould be as unconstitutional as it would be at the level of\na town.\n   The upshot is that if we decide the case as it comes to us\n4            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwe will shut our eyes to a substantial, if not the substan\ntial, issue raised by the facts. But if we were to expand\nthe issues presented to us by remanding for enquiry into\nviewpoint discrimination, we would risk having to wink\nlater at an unconstitutional application of the law to the\nState, owing to the unions’ decision not to challenge that\napplication either in the Ninth Circuit or before us. This\nis a good description of a case that should not be in this\nCourt as a vehicle to refine First Amendment doctrine.\n   I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted, and I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145909, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/02/24/Ysursa_v._Pocatello_Ed._Assn..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 3, 2008—Decided February 24, 2009\nIdaho’s Right to Work Act permits public employees to authorize pay\n  roll deductions for general union dues, but prohibits such deductions\n  for union political activities. Respondents—a group of Idaho public\n  employee unions—sued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions\n  for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amend\n  ments. The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but\n  struck it down as it applies to local governments. In affirming, the\n  Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over\n  local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their\n  payroll deduction systems. The court applied strict scrutiny to hold\n  that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.\nHeld: Idaho’s ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local\n governmental units, does not infringe the unions’ First Amendment\n rights. Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) Content-based restrictions on speech are “presumptively inva\n lid” and subject to strict scrutiny. Davenport v. Washington Ed.\n Assn., 551 U. S. 177, ___. The First Amendment does not, however,\n impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech. See Regan\n v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549. Idaho’s\n law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote\n that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activi\n ties. Idaho’s public employee unions are free to engage in such\n speech as they see fit. They simply are barred from enlisting the\n State in support of that endeavor. Idaho’s decision to limit public\n employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions’\n First Amendment rights. The State accordingly need only demon\n strate a rational basis to justify the ban. Idaho’s justification is the\n2                  YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favorit\n    ism or entanglement with partisan politics. See, e.g., Civil Service\n    Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565. And the State’s re\n    sponse to the problem is limited to its source—political payroll deduc\n    tions. Cf. Davenport, supra. The ban plainly serves the State’s inter\n    est in separating public employment from political activities. Pp. 5–\n    8.\n       (b) The ban at issue is valid at the local level. The same deferential\n    review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local govern\n    mental entities. Political subdivisions have never been considered\n    sovereign entities but are instead “subordinate governmental in\n    strumentalities.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575. The State’s\n    legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it\n    is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart\n    of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies de\n    pending on the level of government affected. The ban furthers\n    Idaho’s interest in separating the operation of government from par\n    tisan politics, and that interest extends to all public employers at\n    whatever level of government.

He may not, however,\nchoose to have an amount deducted and remitted to the\nunion’s political action committee, because Idaho law\nprohibits payroll deductions for political activities. A\ngroup of unions representing Idaho public employees\nchallenged this limitation. They conceded that the limita\ntion was valid as applied at the state level, but argued\nthat it violated their First Amendment rights when ap\nplied to county, municipal, school district, and other local\npublic employers.\n   We do not agree. The First Amendment prohibits gov\nernment from “abridging the freedom of speech”; it does\nnot confer an affirmative right to use government payroll\nmechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expres\nsion. Idaho’s law does not restrict political speech, but\nrather declines to promote that speech by allowing public\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployee checkoffs for political activities. Such a decision\nis reasonable in light of the State’s interest in avoiding the\nappearance that carrying out the public’s business is\ntainted by partisan political activity. That interest ex\ntends to government at the local as well as state level, and\nnothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from\ndetermining that its political subdivisions may not provide\npayroll deductions for political activities.\n                                I\n   Idaho’s Right to Work Act declares that the “right to\nwork shall not be infringed or restricted in any way based\non membership in, affiliation with, or financial support of\na labor organization or on refusal to join, affiliate with, or\nfinancially or otherwise support a labor organization.”\n1985 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 2, §1 (codified at Idaho Code\n§44–2001 (Michie 2003)). As part of that policy, the Act\nprohibits any requirement for the payment of dues or fees\nto a labor organization as a condition of employment, §44–\n2003, but authorizes employers to deduct union fees from\nan employee’s wages with the employee’s “signed written\nauthorization,” §44–2004(1). The Act covers all employ\nees, “including all employees of the state and its political\nsubdivisions.” §44–2011.\n   Prior to 2003, employees could authorize both a payroll\ndeduction for general union dues and a payroll deduction\nfor union political activities conducted through a political\naction committee. App. 55–56, 83–84. In 2003, the Idaho\nLegislature passed the Voluntary Contributions Act\n(VCA). 2003 Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho\nCode §§44–2601 through 44–2605, and §44–2004). That\nlegislation, among other things, amended the Right to\nWork Act by adding a prohibition on payroll deductions for\npolitical purposes. That amendment provides: “Deduc\ntions for political activities as defined in chapter 26, title\n44, Idaho Code, shall not be deducted from the wages,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Violations of\n§44–2004(2) are punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000\nor up to 90 days of imprisonment, or both. §44–2007.\n   Shortly before the VCA was to take effect, plaintiff labor\norganizations sued the Bannock County prosecuting at\ntorney, the Idaho secretary of state, and the Idaho attor\nney general in their official capacities, alleging that the\nban on political payroll deductions was unconstitutional\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. App. 18–41.1 The District\nCourt rejected that argument with respect to public em\nployers at the state level, concluding that the First\nAmendment does not compel the State “to subsidize\nspeech by providing, at its own expense, payroll deduc\ntions for the purpose of paying union dues or association\nfees for State employees.” Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Heide\nman, 2005 WL 3241745, *2 (D Idaho, Nov. 23, 2005). The\n\n——————\n   1 The unions also challenged other provisions of the VCA, including\n\none requiring labor organizations to establish a “separate segregated\nfund” for political activities. Idaho Code §§44–2601 through 44–2605\n(Michie 2002); see App. 27–34. In response to that challenge, the State\nagreed to strike “all of the VCA except for its ban on political payroll\ndeductions.” Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Heideman, 2005 WL 3241745, *1 (D\nIdaho, Nov. 23, 2005). The State asserted that the ban could be “given\neffect since it operates without reference to the existence of a separate\nsegregated fund.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The unions\ndo not dispute that the ban on political payroll deductions is severable\nfrom the other challenged provisions.

POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nban was valid at the state level because “the State is\nincurring costs to set up and maintain the [payroll deduc\ntion] program.” Ibid. The court struck down the VCA,\nhowever, “to the extent that it applies to local govern\nments and private employers,” because the State had\nfailed to identify any subsidy it provided to such employ\ners to administer payroll deductions. Id., at *2 (footnote\nomitted), *6.\n   The state defendants appealed, contending that the ban\non political payroll deductions may be constitutionally\napplied to local government employees. Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heideman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\nNeither party challenged the District Court’s rulings as to\nprivate and state-level employees, and therefore the only\nissue remaining concerned application of the ban to local\ngovernment employees.\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\nthat there was “no subsidy by the State of Idaho for the\npayroll deduction systems of local governments.” Id., at\n1059. The appellate court remarked that “the generalized\nlawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a\nstate’s political subdivisions does not establish that the\nstate is acting as a proprietor” with respect to local gov\nernment employers. Id., at 1064. The court instead re\ngarded the relationship between the State and its political\nsubdivisions as analogous to that between the State and a\nregulated private utility. See id., at 1063–1065 (citing\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980)). While “Idaho has the ulti\nmate power of control over the units of government at\nissue,” it did not “actually operat[e] or contro[l] the payroll\ndeduction systems of local units of government.” 504\nF. 3d, at 1068.

The unions\nassert that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls\ninto this category because the law singles out political\nspeech for disfavored treatment.\n    The First Amendment, however, protects the right to be\nfree from government abridgment of speech. While in\nsome contexts the government must accommodate expres\nsion, it is not required to assist others in funding the\nexpression of particular ideas, including political ones.\n“[A] legislature’s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a\nfundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is\nnot subject to strict scrutiny.” Regan v.

But the parties agree that the\nState is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll\ndeductions at all. See Plaintiffs’ Reply Memorandum 10;\nsee also Toledo Area AFL–CIO Council v. Pizza, 154 F. 3d\n307, 319–320 (CA6 1998); cf. Charlotte v. Firefighters, 426\nU.

And the State’s deci\nsion not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions’\nspeech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see\nfit. They simply are barred from enlisting the State in\nsupport of that endeavor. Idaho’s decision to limit public\nemployer payroll deductions as it has “is not subject to\nstrict scrutiny” under the First Amendment. Regan, 461\nU. S., at 549.\n   Given that the State has not infringed the unions’ First\nAmendment rights, the State need only demonstrate a\nrational basis to justify the ban on political payroll deduc\ntions. Id., at 546–551. The prohibition is not “aim[ed] at\nthe suppression of dangerous ideas,” id., at 548 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but is instead justified by the\nState’s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics. We have previously recognized such a purpose in\nupholding limitations on public employee political activi\nties. See Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413\nU. S. 548, 565 (1973) (public perception of partiality can\nundermine confidence in representative government);\nPublic Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.

Idaho’s decision to allow\npayroll deductions for some purposes but not for political\nactivities is plainly reasonable.2\n   Davenport guides our resolution here. That case also\ninvolved a distinction based on the content of speech:\nSpecific consent was required from nonunion members\nbefore agency fees charged to them could be used for elec\ntion-related activities, but consent was not required with\nrespect to agency fees used for other purposes. 551 U. S.,\nat 181–182. We rejected the unions’ argument that this\nrequirement violated the First Amendment because it\nturned on the content of the speech at issue. Id., at 188–\n190. We recognized that the statute, rather than sup\npressing union speech, simply declined to assist that\nspeech by granting the unions the right to charge agency\nfees for election activities. That decision was reasonable\n\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER finds this analysis inapplicable because the chal\n\nlenged provision removes politically related deductions from an existing\nsystem. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut available deductions do not have tenure; a legislature is free to\naddress concerns as they arise.\n  JUSTICE BREYER would also subject the ban to more exacting scrutiny\nby analogizing it to various direct restrictions on expression. See post,\nat 2–4. That analogy misses the mark. A decision not to assist fund\nraising that may, as a practical matter, result in fewer contributions is\nsimply not the same as directly limiting expression. Cf. Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983)\n(“Although [a union] does not have as much money as it wants, and\nthus cannot exercise its freedom of speech as much as it would like, the\nConstitution does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be\nnecessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). We therefore would not subject Idaho’s\nstatute to the “open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors” proposed by\nthe dissent as an alternative to rational basis review. Jerome B.\nGrubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547\n(1995); see post, at 4.\n8                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven the State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nelection process. Ibid. We also concluded that the State\ndid “not have to enact an across-the-board limitation . . . to\nvindicate [its] more narrow concern.” Id., at 189.\n   Here the restriction is on the use of a checkoff to fund\npolitical activities, but the same analysis governs. Idaho\ndoes not suppress political speech but simply declines to\npromote it through public employer checkoffs for political\nactivities. The concern that political payroll deductions\nmight be seen as involving public employers in politics\narises only because Idaho permits public employer payroll\ndeductions in the first place. As in Davenport, the State’s\nresponse to that problem is limited to its source—in this\ncase, political payroll deductions. The ban on such deduc\ntions plainly serves the State’s interest in separating\npublic employment from political activities.3\n——————\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER suggests that the ban on political payroll deduc\n\ntions may not be applied evenhandedly to all politically related deduc\ntions. Post, at 4–6 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nJUSTICE STEVENS goes further and would find the ban unconstitutional\nin all its applications as discriminatory. Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion).\nThe District Court, however, noted that the ban “is not viewpoint\nbased,” 2005 WL 3241745, *3; the unions acknowledged in their Court\nof Appeals brief that they “have not attempted to establish that Section\n44–2004(2) is based on viewpoint discrimination,” Brief for Plaintiffs-\nAppellees in No. 06–35004 (CA9), p. 18, n. 13; and nothing in the\nQuestions Presented before this Court raised any issue of viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   The ban on political payroll deductions is by its terms not limited to\nany particular type of political contribution. Nothing in the record\nsuggests that public employers permit deductions for some political\nactivities but not for those of unions. Idaho’s attorney general—\ncharged with enforcing the ban—explicitly confirmed that it “applies to\nall organizations, to any deduction regarding political issues, applies\nregardless of viewpoint or message, applies to all employers, and it does\nnot single out any candidates or issues.” App. 110. If the ban is not\nenforced evenhandedly, plaintiffs are free to bring an as applied chal\nlenge. See National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 587\n(1998).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The unions abandoned their challenge to the\nrestriction at the state level, but contend that strict scru\ntiny is still warranted when the ban is applied to local\ngovernment employers. In that context, the unions argue,\nthe State is no longer declining to facilitate speech\nthrough its own payroll system, but is obstructing speech\nin the local governments’ payroll systems. See Brief for\nRespondents 44–46. We find that distinction unpersua\nsive, and hold that the same deferential review applies\nwhether the prohibition on payroll deductions for political\nspeech is directed at state or local governmental entities.\n  “Political subdivisions of States—counties, cities, or\nwhatever—never were and never have been considered as\nsovereign entities.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575\n(1964).    They are instead “subordinate governmental\ninstrumentalities created by the State to assist in the\ncarrying out of state governmental functions.” Ibid.; see\nalso Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v. Mayor and Administrators\nof New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, 287 (1883) (“Municipal\ncorporations are instrumentalities of the State for the\nconvenient administration of government within their\nlimits”). State political subdivisions are “merely . . . de\npartment[s] of the State, and the State may withhold,\ngrant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit.”\nTrenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). Here the\nIdaho Legislature has elected to withhold from all public\nemployers the power to provide payroll deductions for\npolitical activities.\n  The State’s legislative action is of course subject to First\nAmendment and other constitutional scrutiny whether\nthat action is applicable at the state level, the local level,\nboth, or some subpart of either. But we are aware of no\ncase suggesting that a different analysis applies under the\nFirst Amendment depending on the level of government\n10            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffected, and the unions have cited none. The ban on\npolitical payroll deductions furthers Idaho’s interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics. That interest extends to all public employers at\nwhatever level of government.\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Ap\npeals invoked our decision in Consolidated Edison Co. of\nN. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530. In\nthat case, we held that a state commission could not,\nconsistent with the First Amendment, prohibit a privately\nowned electric utility from discussing controversial issues\nin its bill inserts. Id., at 544. We ruled that the fact that\nthe State regulated the utility did not authorize the prohi\nbition. Id., at 540. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe same analysis applied here, and that “the State’s\nbroad powers of control over local government entities are\nsolely those of a regulator, analogous to the [state commis\nsion’s] regulatory power over [the private utility].” 504\nF. 3d, at 1065.\n  That analogy is misguided. A private corporation is\nsubject to the government’s legal authority to regulate its\nconduct. A political subdivision, on the other hand, is a\nsubordinate unit of government created by the State to\ncarry out delegated governmental functions. A private\ncorporation enjoys constitutional protections, see First\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14\n(1978), but a political subdivision, “created by the state for\nthe better ordering of government, has no privileges or\nimmunities under the federal constitution which it may\ninvoke in opposition to the will of its creator.” Williams v.\nMayor of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, 40 (1933); see Trenton v.\nNew Jersey, supra, at 185 (municipality, as successor to a\nprivate water company, does not enjoy against the State\nthe same constitutional rights as the water company:\n“[T]he relations existing between the State and the water\ncompany were not the same as those between the State\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand the City”).\n   Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found\nit significant that “there is no subsidy by the State of\nIdaho for the payroll deduction systems of local govern\nments.” 504 F. 3d, at 1059; see also 2005 WL 3241745, *2.\nThe Court of Appeals emphasized that there was no evi\ndence that “Idaho has attempted to use its asserted pow\ners to manage the day-to-day operations of local govern\nment personnel.”        504 F. 3d, at 1067.      Given the\nrelationship between the State and its political subdivi\nsions, however, it is immaterial how the State allocates\nfunding or management responsibilities between the\ndifferent levels of government. The question is whether\nthe State must affirmatively assist political speech by\nallowing public employers to administer payroll deduc\ntions for political activities. For the reasons set forth in\nthis opinion, the answer is no.\n                       *    *    *\n  The Court of Appeals ruling that Idaho Code §44–\n2004(2) is unconstitutional with respect to local units of\ngovernment is reversed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

See ante, at 4, 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4. The\nsole question posed for this Court’s decision is the appro\npriate placement of the State’s political subdivisions: For\nthe purpose at hand, should the Court align local\ngovernment employment with private-sector employment\nor with state-level employment?\n  “Given the relationship between the State and its politi\ncal subdivisions,” the Court persuasively explains, “it is\nimmaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment.” Ante, at 11. I agree that, in the context here\ninvolved, the Constitution compels no distinction between\nstate and local governmental entities.

See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575 (1964).\nHence the fact that a state statute, rather than a munici\npal ordinance, limits the use of the municipality’s payroll\ndeduction system is beside the point. I agree that this is\nso, and I agree with JUSTICE SOUTER’s discussion about\nthe relationship between the state and the municipality.\n  I do not agree, however, with the Court’s further analy\nsis of the pertinent legal question—whether the state\nstatute violates the First Amendment. Nor do I agree\nwith its ultimate conclusion. Rather, in my view, we\nshould remand this case for further consideration.\n    The Court’s First Amendment analysis emphasizes its\ncharacterization of the statute as not “abridging” a union’s\nor a worker’s “freedom of speech,” but rather “declin[ing]\nto promote” that speech. Ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I agree that the First Amendment does\nnot prohibit government from “declining to promote”\nspeech. It says that government shall not “abridg[e] the\nfreedom of speech.” (Emphasis added) . But I do not think\nthe distinction particularly useful in this case.\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    That is because here the distinction is neither easy to\ndraw nor likely to prove determinative. Sometimes, I\nconcede, the distinction may help. Were there no payroll\ndeduction system at all and were the unions arguing for\nthe creation of such a system from scratch, one might\ncharacterize their claim as seeking the promotion of\nspeech. But that is not the situation here. A deduction\nsystem already exists. The unions attack a separate\nstatutory provision that removes politically related deduc\ntions from that system. And linguistically speaking, one\nneed not characterize such an attack as (1) seeking speech\npromotion rather than (2) seeking to prevent an abridg\nment of political-speech-related activity that otherwise\n(i.e., in the absence of the exception) would occur. In such\nan instance, the debate over characterization is more\nmetaphysical than practical.\n     More importantly, the characterization quite possibly\ndoes not matter.        Suppose, for example, a somewhat\nsimilar statutory exception picks and chooses among\npolitical causes, prohibiting deductions that help one\npolitical party while permitting deductions that help\nanother. The First Amendment result could not turn upon\nwhether one described the exception as an “abridgment” or\na “promotion” failure. And, as I shall explain, infra, at 5–\n6, such may be the case here.\n     I disagree with the Court’s characterizations in an\nother respect. The Court says that because the exception\n“has not infringed the unions’ First Amendment rights,”\n“strict scrutiny” does not apply and, thus, the State “need\nonly demonstrate a rational basis”—the standard of re\nview applicable to any ordinary legislation that does not\ninfringe fundamental rights—“to justify the ban on politi\ncal payroll deductions.” Ante, at 6 (emphasis added). I\nagree that the exception does not call for “strict scru\ntiny”—a categorization that almost always proves fatal to\nthe law in question. After all, the exception does not\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nrestrict the content of the unions’ speech, impose a prior\nrestraint on that speech, or ban union speech on political\nissues altogether.\n     But I disagree with the Court in that I believe there is\na First Amendment interest at stake. The exception\naffects speech, albeit indirectly, by restricting a channel\nthrough which speech-supporting finance might flow. As a\nresult, the alternative to “strict scrutiny” is not necessarily\na form of “rational basis” review—a test that almost every\nrestriction will pass. And instead of applying either “strict\nscrutiny” or “rational basis” review to the statutory excep\ntion, I would ask the question that this Court has asked in\nother speech-related contexts, namely whether the statute\nimposes a burden upon speech that is disproportionate in\nlight of the other interests the government seeks to\nachieve. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433–434\n(1992) (election regulation); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 403 (2000) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (collecting cases); see also, e.g., Thompson v.\nWestern States Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 388 (2002)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting) (discussing the Court’s applica\ntion of this approach in the commercial speech context);\nDenver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v.\nFCC, 518 U. S. 727, 740–747 (1996) (plurality opinion)\n(cable programming regulation); Pickering v. Board of Ed.\nof Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S.\n563, 568 (1968) (government employee speech). Constitu\ntional courts in other nations also have used similar ap\nproaches when facing somewhat similar problems. See,\ne.g., Libman v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S. C.\nR. 569 (Canada) (applying proportionality in the campaign\nfinance context); Bowman v. United Kingdom, 26 Euro\npean Ct. of Human Rights 1 (1998) (same); Midi Television\n(Pty) Ltd v. Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] SCA 56\n(RSA) (South Africa) (applying proportionality in the\nfreedom of press context); Bakri v. Israel Film Council,\n4             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nHCJ 316/303 (Israel 2003) (applying proportionality in the\nfreedom of expression context).\n   In these cases the Court has sought to determine\nwhether the harm to speech-related interests is dispropor\ntionate in light of the degree of harm, justifications, and\npotential alternatives. In doing so, it has considered the\nseriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will\nlikely cause, the importance of the provision’s countervail\ning objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to\nachieve those objectives, and whether there are other less\nrestrictive ways of doing so. In light of these considera\ntions, it has determined whether ultimately the statute\nworks speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its\njustifications. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (describing need for a “fit”\nbetween legislative ends and means “whose scope is ‘in\nproportion to the interest served’ ”); United States v.\nAmerican Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 217–218\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n    Where context calls for “strict scrutiny,” one would not\nnecessarily ask these proportionality questions; but I\nwould ask them in other contexts calling for less than\nordinary legislative leeway in light of the fact that consti\ntutionally protected expression is at issue. See id., at 218.\nTo do so, in my view, helps structure what the Court\nsometimes calls an “intermediate scrutiny” inquiry. See\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622\n(1994).\n   Applying this analysis here, I would find the statutory\nexception constitutional, but only if I were convinced that\nthe exception applied even handedly among similar politi\ncally related contributions. If so, the provision would still\nnegatively affect speech-related interests, for it would\nclose off one channel through which individuals might\nprovide speech-enabling funds to political institutions.\nBut, as the majority points out, many other channels for\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthose funds exist, and the State has a strong interest in\n“avoiding the reality or appearance of government favorit\nism or entanglement with partisan politics,” ante, at 6. I\nwould consequently find the restriction justified as propor\ntionately serving a legitimate, important governmental\nneed. Cf. Fox, supra, at 480.\n    It is not clear, however, whether the particular excep\ntion before us does, in fact, operate even handedly. To\nread the statute without more, I concede, suggests even\nhandedness. The provision says that “[d]eductions for\npolitical activities as defined in chapter 26, title 44, Idaho\nCode, shall not be deducted from wages, earnings or com\npensation of an employee.” Idaho Code Ann. §44–2004(2)\n(Michie 2003) (emphasis added). And chapter 26, title 44,\nIdaho Code, defines “political activities” without special\nreference to labor organizations. See §44–2602(e).\n   Nonetheless, certain features of the provision suggest it\nmay affect some politically-related deductions, namely\nlabor-related deductions, but not others. Title 44 of the\nIdaho Code—entitled “Labor”—is about labor activities.\nAnd the ban on payroll deductions for political activities\nwas enacted as part of a statute in which every other pro\nvision is concerned solely with union activities. See Vol\nuntary Contributions Act, 2003 Idaho Sess. Laws chs. 97\nand 340 (codified at Idaho Code Ann. §§44–2601 through\n44–2605 and §44–2004). At the same time, the provision\ncontaining the payroll deduction ban is immediately fol\nlowed by another related provision that expressly men\ntions labor unions. See §44–2004(3) (“Nothing in this\nchapter shall prohibit an employee from personally paying\ncontributions for political activities . . . to a labor organiza\ntion unless such payment is prohibited by law” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   It is important to know whether the exception concerns\nonly labor-related political deductions (while allowing\nother similar deductions) or treats all alike. A restriction\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat applies to the political activities of unions alone\nwould seem unlikely to further the government’s justifying\nobjective, namely providing the appearance of political\nneutrality. And in that case, the provision could well\nbring about speech-related harm that is disproportionate\nto the statute’s tendency to further the government’s\n“neutrality” objective.\n   Because the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue as if\nthe State “regulated” its municipalities (as government\nmight regulate a private firm), it did not resolve the ques\ntions I have just described. I would remand the case so\nthat it can decide whether the parties appropriately raised\nthose matters and, if so, consider them. Accordingly, I\nwould vacate the Court of Appeals’ decision and remand\nthe case.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

POCATELLO EDUCATION \n\n             ASSOCIATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n  In both the public and private sector, payroll managers\nroutinely remit portions of employees’ wages to third\nparties pursuant to the employees’ written instructions.\nFor decades, employers in Idaho had discretion to allow\nsuch payroll deductions. In 2003, however, the State\nenacted the Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA), 2003\nSess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code §44–\n2004, and §§44–2601 through 44–2605 (Michie 2003)),\nwhich, among other things, prohibits employers from\nallowing any payroll deduction for “political activities,”\n§44–2004(2). For several reasons, I cannot conclude as the\nCourt does that this restriction on payroll deductions was\nreasonably calculated to further the State’s “interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics,” ante, at 10. Because it is clear to me that the\nrestriction was intended to make it more difficult for\nunions to finance political speech, I would hold it unconsti\ntutional in all its applications.\n                             I\n  “It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate\nspeech based on its substantive content or the message it\nconveys.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\n2                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nVa., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995). On its face, §44–2004(2)\nrestricts payroll deductions for all political activities, and\npetitioners contend that the State reasonably enacted\n§44–2004(2) “to avoid either the appearance or the reality\nof public employer involvement in . . . electoral politics.”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15. Several features of the statute, how\never, belie its purported viewpoint neutrality.\n   That the restriction was more narrowly intended to\ntarget union fundraising is first evidenced by its statutory\ncontext. The other provisions of the VCA with which §44–\n2004(2) was enacted pertain exclusively to unions.1 For\ninstance, §44–2603 requires unions to create separate\nfunds for political activities and places restrictions on\nunions’ solicitation of political contributions; §44–2604\nmakes it a misdemeanor, among other things, for unions\nto make expenditures for political activities from union\ndues; and §44–2605 establishes registration and reporting\nrequirements for union political funds. The provisions\nproximate to §44–2004(2), which were enacted roughly two\ndecades earlier as part of the Right to Work Act, 1985\nSess. Laws ch. 2, §1 (codified at Idaho Code §44–2001 et\nseq.), are similarly directed at union activities. Even the\nsubsection immediately preceding §44–2004(2) is aimed\nspecifically at unions: §44–2004(1) prohibits payroll deduc\ntions for union dues, fees, assessments, or other charges\nwithout an employee’s prior written authorization. And,\nfinally, §44–2004(2) is codified in a title of the Idaho Code\nentitled “Labor” and in a chapter entitled “Right to Work.”\nTogether, these statutory features strongly suggest that\nthe Idaho Legislature enacted §44–2004(2) specifically to\nimpede union fundraising.\n——————\n   1 Respondents also challenged these provisions of the VCA, and peti\n\ntioners conceded their invalidity earlier in this litigation, acknowledg\ning that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of\nlabor organizations to solicit political contributions. See Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The statute’s discriminatory purpose is further evi\ndenced by its substantial overinclusiveness and underin\nclusiveness with respect to the State’s asserted interest in\npassing the legislation. Petitioners contend that the\nrestriction was enacted to further the State’s interest in\navoiding the appearance or actuality of public employer\ninvolvement in partisan politics. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.\nBut, as enacted, §44–2004(2) prohibited private as well as\npublic employers from making payroll deductions for\npolitical activities. As petitioners admitted at oral argu\nment, “the State has no interest in . . . private employers’\ndetermination to be involved or not involved in political\nmatters.” Id., at 6. That petitioners conceded the invalid\nity of §44–2004(2) as applied to private employers earlier\nin this litigation does not require us to ignore the breadth\nof the statute the State enacted in assessing the provi\nsion’s scope and purpose. Consideration of the provision\nactually passed by the legislature makes clear that the\nState’s asserted interest in the restriction is not compati\nble with its breadth.\n   The State’s interest in avoiding the appearance or real\nity of employer political involvement is also inconsistent\nwith its decision not to restrict deductions for charitable\nactivities. Such deductions will often present a similar\nrisk of creating an appearance of political involvement as\ndeductions for covered political activities. Yet the State\nhas made no effort to distinguish this type of political\nactivity. As with the State’s decision to apply §44–2004(2)\nto private employers, its failure to apply the restriction to\ncharitable deductions produces a significant mismatch\nbetween the restriction’s reach and its asserted purpose.\n   To my mind, it is clear from these features of the legisla\ntion that §44–2004(2)’s prohibition on payroll deductions\nfor “political activities” was intended to target union po\nlitical activity.

ASSN.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n(noting that a rule restricting the use of state funds to\npromote or oppose unionization impermissibly expressed a\npro-union preference, thereby chilling one side of the\npublic debate).2 The majority’s facile assertion that the\nFirst Amendment does not confer a right to government\nsubsidization of private speech cannot validate an evi\ndently discriminatory restriction on fundraising for politi\ncal speech.3\n                              II\n  Although the statute’s discriminatory purpose provides\nan adequate ground for deciding this case, I briefly note\nmy disagreement with the majority’s analysis of §44–\n2004(2)’s constitutionality as applied to local government\nemployees. The Court of Appeals found this application of\nthe provision invalid due to the State’s failure to show that\nit “actually operates or controls the payroll deduction\nsystems of local units of government.” Pocatello Ed. Assn.\n——————\n    2 It\n       may even be true that §44–2004(2) only affects union political\nactivity, as petitioners can point to no evidence that another entity is\naffected by the statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. But it is unnecessary to\ndetermine whether other entities are actually affected by the restriction\nin light of its clearly discriminatory purpose.\n   3 The discriminatory nature of §44–2004(2) distinguishes it from the\n\nrestriction we upheld in Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S.\n177 (2007)—a decision on which the majority heavily relies. In that\ncase, state law authorized public-sector unions to charge nonmembers\nan agency fee equivalent to membership dues and to have employers\ncollect that fee through payroll deductions. Respondent challenged the\nvalidity of a state ballot initiative requiring public-sector unions to\nobtain nonmembers’ affirmative authorization before using their fees\nfor political purposes. We held that the affirmative-authorization\nprovision did not violate respondent’s First Amendment rights because\nit merely placed a viewpoint-neutral limitation on an “extraordinary”\nstate-law entitlement allowing it to collect and spend the money of\ngovernment employees. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 10). By contrast,\n§44–2004(2) is not a limitation on a state-law entitlement that specifi\ncally benefits unions but rather a union-specific exclusion from a\ngenerally available benefit.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2007).4 In the\nabsence of evidence of such control, the Court of Appeals\nheld, “the State has a relatively weak interest in prevent\ning [respondents] from exercising their First Amendment\nrights.” Ibid.\n    Unlike the Court of Appeals, the majority omits any\nexamination of the relationship Idaho has established\nwith its political subdivisions. Rather, the majority finds\nit sufficient to assert that States, as the creators of local\ngovernment, retain the authority to grant or withdraw\nsubdivision powers and privileges. Ante, at 8. The fact of\nthat authority, however, hardly proves that the particular\nrelationship between a State and its political subdivisions\nis irrelevant to our constitutional inquiry. All States do\nnot treat their subdivisions the same, and those differ\nences are sometimes consequential.\n    We have in other contexts recognized the constitutional\nsignificance of the relationship a State chooses to establish\nwith its political subdivisions. For instance, in Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977),\nwe stated that the answer to the question whether a\nschool board should “be treated as an arm of the State\npartaking of the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity\n. . . depends, at least in part, upon the nature of the entity\ncreated by state law.” And in McMillian v. Monroe\nCounty, 520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997), we held that whether a\nsheriff has county or state policymaking authority for\npurposes of determining liability under Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983 is ascertained by reference to “the actual\nfunction of a government official,” which is in turn “de\npendent on the definition of the official’s functions under\nrelevant state law.” In both cases, the constitutional\n——————\n  4 The State conceded at oral argument before the Court of Appeals\n\nthat it is not the proprietor of local government workplaces or their\npayroll deduction programs. See 504 F. 3d, at 1065.\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis turned in part on the way the State had struc\ntured its relationship with its political subdivisions.\n   Although we have not previously considered the impli\ncations of the state-subdivision relationship in the First\nAmendment context, we have repeatedly recognized the\nsignificance of an analogous inquiry: whether the govern\nment, in imposing speech restrictions, is acting in its\ncapacity as regulator or proprietor. See, e.g., Davenport v.\nWashington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, at ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 9–10); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 805–806 (1985). Accordingly, I\ncannot agree with the majority’s assertion that, because\npolitical subdivisions are instrumentalities of the State, “it\nis immaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment,” ante, at 11. Relationships between state and\nlocal governments are more varied, and the consequences\nof that variation are more significant, than the majority’s\nanalysis admits.\n   Because my conclusion that §44–2004(2) discriminates\nagainst labor organizations is sufficient to decide this case,\nI find it unnecessary to fully consider the implications of\nIdaho’s relationship with its political subdivisions.\nRather, I note the significance of this relationship to urge\nits careful consideration in future cases.\n                               III\n  The majority avoids acknowledging §44–2004(2)’s evi\ndently discriminatory purpose only by examining the\nstatute out of context and ignoring its initial applicability\nto private employers. Considering the provision as en\nacted, I cannot find it justified as the majority does by “the\nState’s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics,” ante, at 6.

So far as\nIdaho’s law affects freedom of expression, I am not per\nsuaded there is sufficient reason to treat the State’s statu\ntory prohibition differently depending on the unit of its\ngovernment employing the worker whose salary deduction\nwould fund political activity. There is no question in this\ncase that the lower echelons of Idaho government are\ncreatures of the State exercising state power in discharg\ning what are ultimately state responsibilities. Nor is there\nany apparent reason to think the State’s asserted legiti\nmate interest differs according to the level of government\ndoing the State’s work, whether that interest is having a\nfirewall between public administration and politics or\nsimply exercising a power to decide whether public em\nployees who administer payrolls should spend work time\nadvancing private political speech.\n   But I find it impossible to stop there. Although this case\ncomes to us as one about the scope of the public business\nthe State is free, within reasonable limits, to manage as it\nthinks wise, the specter of another First Amendment\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncategory, one of superior significance, is too insistent to\nignore. It is true that government may choose to manage\nits own affairs in ways that draw reasonable subject\nmatter lines affecting speech, being free, for example, to\nsell space on its buses for advertising soap but not politi\ncians. See Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298\n(1974). But a government is not free to draw those lines\nas a way to discourage or suppress the expression of view\npoints it disagrees with, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal De\nfense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806, 811–812,\n(1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 46, 49 (1983); only narrow tailoring to serve\na compelling state interest could justify that kind of selec\ntivity, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,\nInc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000).\n   This difference between viewpoint discrimination and\nneutral regulation of governmental activity is on point in\nthis case. For although the State invokes its legitimate\ninterest in keeping public administration free from politi\ncal involvement as its reason for Idaho Code §44–2004(2)\n(Michie 2003), this ostensibly viewpoint-neutral rationale\nsuffers from the circumstances JUSTICE STEVENS describes\nin detail, see ante, at 2–4 (dissenting opinion). Every\nother provision of the amendatory act in which §44–\n2004(2) was included deals with unions, the statute\namended regulates unions, and all this legislation is\nplaced in the State’s labor law codification. Ante., at 2.\nUnion speech, and nothing else, seems to have been on the\nlegislative mind.\n   The Court’s answer to this recalls Davenport v. Wash\nington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177 (2007), in suggesting that\nIdaho was merely limiting a self-created risk of entangling\npublic administration with politics, which followed from\nauthorizing public payroll deductions for union benefit in\nthe first place, ante, at 7–8. But the scope of the state\nenactment that imposes the prohibition places that expla\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nnation in question, for the statute goes beyond constrain\ning the government as employer, and criminalizes deduc\ntions for political purposes even when administered by\nprivate employers, an application of the law the State\nconcedes is unconstitutional. Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Hei\ndeman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007). Hence a reader\nof the statute may fairly suspect that Idaho’s legislative\nobject was not efficient, clean government, but that un\nions’ political viewpoints were its target, selected out of all\nthe politics the State might filter from its public work\nplaces.\n   What to do about this reasonable suspicion of viewpoint\ndiscrimination is a dilemma. We can hardly disregard it,\nfor it affects the weight this case can carry as precedent; a\ndecision that ignores the elephant in the room is a decision\nwith diminished authority. But the potential issue of\nviewpoint discrimination that should be addressed in this\ncase is not before us. Although the unions’ brief alludes to\nviewpoint discrimination in several places, that is not the\nfocus of their argument. The unions, instead, aim at\nshowing that the State is acting as a regulator of local\ngovernments (much as it regulates private corporations),\nnot as a manager setting limits to what government will\ndo with public resources; consequently they rest their\nposition on the argument that any state discrimination\nagainst political speech is illegitimate, however consis\ntently all shades of political speech may be treated. And\neven if we could properly recast the case by remanding to\nconsider viewpoint discrimination, see Cornelius, supra, at\n811–812, a remand could only affect the application of the\nstatute to subordinate units of government; the unions\nhave accepted the constitutionality of applying the law to\nthe State, where an effort at viewpoint discrimination\nwould be as unconstitutional as it would be at the level of\na town.\n   The upshot is that if we decide the case as it comes to us\n4            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwe will shut our eyes to a substantial, if not the substan\ntial, issue raised by the facts. But if we were to expand\nthe issues presented to us by remanding for enquiry into\nviewpoint discrimination, we would risk having to wink\nlater at an unconstitutional application of the law to the\nState, owing to the unions’ decision not to challenge that\napplication either in the Ninth Circuit or before us. This\nis a good description of a case that should not be in this\nCourt as a vehicle to refine First Amendment doctrine.\n   I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted, and I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145909/", "sha1": "9f57b8315200d334c9c52d036f739d6ec315e52a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-022", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:23"}
