The plaintiff thereupon, by leave of the court, filed an amended petition, containing a single count, alleging Baily 's ownership and possession of the land, and of the timber growing thereon, and that on January 1, 1875, 'and on divers other days from time to time continuously between that day and' May 4, 1885, sundry persons, knowing the land and the timber thereon to be Bailey's property, without any right or authority from him, and at the instance and for the use and benefit of the defendant, cut down and removed, and sawed into logs, a large quantity of the timber; and the defendant, knowing the logs to be cut from the land, and both land and logs to be Bailey's property, took the logs into its possession, and converted them to its own use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the filing of an answer denying the allegations of the amended petition, and before the case came to trial, the court, upon Ellenwood's suggestion that Walton's letters of administration had been revoked, and Ellenwood had been appointed administrator in his stead, entered an order reviving the action in the name of Ellenwood as administrator, but afterwards adjudged that this order be set aside, and that the action be abated and stricken from the docket. This writ of error was thereupon sued out in the name of Walton, and was permitted by this court to be amended by substituting the name of Ellenwood. Walton v. Chair Co., 157 U. S. 342, 15 Sup.

This allegation was of a single cause of action, in which the trespass upon the land was the principal thing, and the conversion of the timber was incidental only, and could not, therefore, be maintained by proof of the conversion of personal property without also proving the trespass upon real estate.
