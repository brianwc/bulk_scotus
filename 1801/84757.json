On the 27th of February 1801, the act of Congress passed providing for the government of the district of Columbia, and by that law a circuit court for the district was erected, and all cases depending in the court of hustings were transferred to the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After two terms of the circuit court of the United States had elapsed without the writ of inquiry being set aside, the defendant in that court moved to set it aside, on filing a special plea in justification to the action. This was refused by the court, and a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the court refusing the plea was tendered.
