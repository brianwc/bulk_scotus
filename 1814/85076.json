The Sally, at the time of her capture, bad on board a coaster's manifest, and a permission from the collector of the port of <i>Passamaquoddy</i>, dated <i>July</i> 7, 1812, to proceed to <i>Boston</i>. From the manifest, her cargo purported to be <i>one box</i> of hones, and <i>one box</i> of furs. She had on board, also, about <i>four thousand bushels of salt</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sally was licensed and enrolled for the coasting trade, at New London, <i>June</i> 6, 1812, upon the oath of <i>John Patterson</i>, of the city of <i>New York</i>, who swore that he was the agent of <i>James Mavor</i>, of <i>New York</i>, the owner.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Patterson</i> was on board at the time of capture. Upon the return of the monition in the District Court, <i>Patterson</i> claimed the brig for <i>Mavor</i>, and <i>Edward Monroe</i> claimed the salt for himself and <i>Lemuel P. Grosvenor</i>, of <i>Boston</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of claim of Monroe did not state where the salt was taken on board, nor for what reason it was not mentioned in the manifest.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Patterson, Porter</i>, the master, and the crew, upon the preparatory examinations, swere that the salt was put on board the brig at <i>Robinstown</i> and <i>Eastport</i>, in the district of Maine.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the papers found on board the Sally, was a permission to land her cargo of 60 tons of cordage and 50 bolts of duck, from the deputy collector of the port of Passamaquoddy, dated <i>June</i> 20, 1812.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also found on board, a letter to Messrs. <i>Monroe</i> and <i>Grosvenor, Boston</i>, dated Eastport, <i>July</i> 7, 1812, signed '<i>L. P. G.</i>' covering a bill of lading of the salt. In this letter it is said, 'I am sorry to say that no clearance of the salt can be obtained on board the brig; I have however despatched her, with a clearance of two small packages of John Brewer, consigned <i>to us</i>, and leave you to manage; it will, at least, be as well as the other goods sent&#8212;and I am hourly expecting a <i>seizure to pay for sundry prizes taken from St. Andrews</i>.' Again&#8212;'A protection can be had, for any vessel bound here with provisions, from the English admiral, &amp;c.' St. Andrews is a small town in New Brunswick, a province belonging to Great Britain.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the manifest of the Sally, the two small packages above mentioned are consigned to <i>Monroe</i> and <i>Grosvcnor</i>, Boston.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The captors produced witnesses in the District Court, who proved that the Sally ilischarged at <i>St. Andrews</i>, her cargo of cordage, after the 1<i>st July</i>, 1812, and took in there the salt.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel and cargo were condemned, in the District Court, to the captors, and an appeal entered by the Claimants. In the Circuit Court the decree was affirmed, and Monroe and Grosvenor appealed to this Court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim was interposed by the United States as for a forfeiture under the non-intercouse act.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the above statement (and upon the argument in the case of the <i>Rapid, ante p.</i> 155,) the case was submitted.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tuesday, March</i> 15<i>th.

In conformity with this rule, it has been solemnly adjudged, by the same course of decisions which has established the illegality of the intercourse, that the property engaged therein must be condemned as prize to the captors, and not to the crown.
