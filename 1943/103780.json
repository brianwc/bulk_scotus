The district court made findings of fact that the claims in issue did not embody any invention over the prior art and entered judgment dismissing the complaint on May 1, 1941. On May 28, 1941, after securing an enlargement of time under Rule 6(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, petitioner filed a motion under Rule 52(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> asking that the findings 'be amended and supplemented'. Petitioner requested that some of the findings relating to non-invention be amended in certain respects set out in the motion so as to show invention and to include a specific finding that the claims in issue did define invention over the prior art. Supplemental findings, intended to dispose of various other defenses asserted by respondent but not passed upon by the court, were also requested. The motion concluded with the statement that: 'Consistently with these findings, the conclusions of law should be amended to state that the claims * * * in suit are valid; that an injunction shall issue in the usual form, and that there be an accounting for past infringement.'
