Argued November 12, 2014—Decided March 25, 2015*\nIn 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State’s 105 House dis-\n  tricts and 35 Senate districts. In doing so, while Alabama sought to\n  achieve numerous traditional districting objectives—e.g., compact-\n  ness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and pro-\n  tecting incumbents—it placed yet greater importance on two goals:\n  (1) minimizing a district’s deviation from precisely equal population,\n  by keeping any deviation less than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2)\n  seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities’ “abil-\n  ity to elect their preferred candidates of choice” under §5 of the Vot-\n  ing Rights Act of 1965, 52 U. S. C. §10304(b), by maintaining roughly\n  the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority\n  districts.\n     Appellants—Alabama Legislative Black Caucus (Caucus), Alabama\n  Democratic Conference (Conference), and others—claim that Ala-\n  bama’s new district boundaries create a “racial gerrymander” in vio-\n  lation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Af-\n  ter a bench trial, the three-judge District Court ruled (2 to 1) for the\n  State. It recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Pro-\n  tection Clause when race is the “predominant” consideration in decid-\n  ing “to place a significant number of voters within or without a par-\n  ticular district,” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913, 916, and the\n  use of race is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state inter-\n  est,” Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 902 (Shaw II).\n     In ruling against appellants, it made four critical determinations:\n——————\n  *Together with No. 13–1138, Alabama Democratic Conference et al. v.\nAlabama et al., also on appeal from the same court.\n2     ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n (1) that both appellants had argued “that the Acts as a whole consti-\n tute racial gerrymanders,” and that the Conference had also argued\n that the State had racially gerrymandered Senate Districts 7, 11, 22,\n and 26; (2) that the Conference lacked standing to make its racial\n gerrymandering claims; (3) that, in any event, appellants’ claims\n must fail because race “was not the predominant motivating factor”\n in making the redistricting decisions; and (4) that, even were it\n wrong about standing and predominance, these claims must fail be-\n cause any predominant use of race was “narrowly tailored” to serve a\n “compelling state interest” in avoiding retrogression under §5.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court’s analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim\n as referring to the State “as a whole,” rather than district-by-district,\n was legally erroneous. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) This Court has consistently described a claim of racial gerry-\n mandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing\n of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts, see, e.g.,\n Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (Shaw I), and has described the\n plaintiff ’s evidentiary burden similarly, see Miller, supra, at 916.\n The Court’s district-specific language makes sense in light of the per-\n sonal nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering\n claim, see Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 957; Shaw I, supra, at 648.\n Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The District Court found the fact that racial criteria had not\n predominated in the drawing of some Alabama districts sufficient to\n defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the State as\n an undifferentiated whole. But a showing that race-based criteria did\n not significantly affect the drawing of some Alabama districts would\n have done little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria predomi-\n nantly affected the drawing of other Alabama districts. Thus, the\n District Court’s undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient,\n and the District Court must on remand consider racial gerrymander-\n ing with respect to the individual districts challenged by appellants.\n Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The Caucus and the Conference did not waive the right to fur-\n ther consideration of a district-by-district analysis. The record indi-\n cates that plaintiffs’ evidence and arguments embody the claim that\n individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered,\n and those are the districts that the District Court must reconsider.\n Although plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove\n that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines,\n neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show wide-\n spread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a\n set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the leg-\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nislature racially gerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated\n“whole.” Pp. 8–12.\n   2. The District Court also erred in deciding, sua sponte, that the\nConference lacked standing. It believed that the “record” did “not\nclearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the\n[Conference] reside.” But the Conference’s post-trial brief and the\ntestimony of a Conference representative support an inference that\nthe organization has members in all of the majority-minority dis-\ntricts, which is sufficient to meet the Conference’s burden of estab-\nlishing standing. At the very least, the Conference reasonably be-\nlieved that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for\nmore detailed information, it need not provide additional information\nsuch as a specific membership list. While the District Court had an\nindependent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, in these circum-\nstances elementary principles of procedural fairness required the\nDistrict Court, rather than acting sua sponte, to give the Conference\nan opportunity to provide evidence of member residence. On remand,\nthe District Court should permit the Conference to file its member-\nship list and the State to respond, as appropriate. Pp. 12–15.\n   3. The District Court also did not properly calculate “predomi-\nnance” in its alternative holding that “[r]ace was not the predominant\nmotivating factor” in the creation of any of the challenged districts.\nIt reached its conclusion in part because it placed in the balance,\namong other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of\napproximately equal population. An equal population goal, however,\nis not one of the “traditional” factors to be weighed against the use of\nrace to determine whether race “predominates,” see Miller, supra, at\n916. Rather, it is part of the redistricting background, taken as a\ngiven, when determining whether race, or other factors, predominate\nin a legislator’s determination as to how equal population objectives\nwill be met. Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the\nlaw, its “predominance” conclusions, including those concerning the\nfour districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well\nhave been different. For example, there is strong, perhaps over-\nwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the\nlegislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26. Pp. 15–19.\n   4. The District Court’s final alternative holding—that “the [chal-\nlenged] Districts would satisfy strict scrutiny”—rests upon a misper-\nception of the law. Section 5 does not require a covered jurisdiction to\nmaintain a particular numerical minority percentage. It requires the\njurisdiction to maintain a minority’s ability to elect a preferred can-\ndidate of choice. Pp. 19–23.\n      (a) The statute’s language, 52 U. S. C. §§10304(b), (d), and De-\npartment of Justice Guidelines make clear that §5 is satisfied if mi-\n4      ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    nority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.\n    The history of §5 further supports this view, as Congress adopted the\n    language in §5 to reject this Court’s decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft,\n    539 U. S. 461, and to accept the views of Justice Souter’s dissent—\n    that, in a §5 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new vot-\n    ing provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to\n    elect a candidate of their choice, and that courts should not mechani-\n    cally rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all\n    significant circumstances, id., at 493, 498, 505, 509. Here, both the\n    District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically\n    numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression. Pp. 19–\n    22.\n         (b) In saying this, this Court does not insist that a state legisla-\n    ture, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority\n    population §5 demands. A court’s analysis of the narrow tailoring re-\n    quirement insists only that the legislature have a “strong basis in ev-\n    idence” in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made. Brief\n    for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. Here, however, the District\n    Court and the legislature both asked the wrong question with respect\n    to narrow tailoring. They asked how to maintain the present minori-\n    ty percentages in majority-minority districts, instead of asking the\n    extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in\n    order to maintain the minority’s present ability to elect the candidate\n    of its choice. Because asking the wrong question may well have led to\n    the wrong answer, the Court cannot accept the District Court’s con-\n    clusion.

The appeals\nfocus upon the appellants’ claims that new district bound-\naries create “racial gerrymanders” in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. See,\ne.g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 907–908 (1996) (Shaw\nII) (Fourteenth Amendment forbids use of race as “ ‘pre-\ndominant’ ” district boundary-drawing “ ‘factor’ ” unless\nboundaries are “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “ ‘compel-\nling state interest’ ” (citations omitted)). We find that the\n2    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluat-\ning the claims. We consequently vacate its decision and\nremand the cases for further proceedings.\n                               I\n   The Alabama Constitution requires the legislature to\nreapportion its State House and Senate electoral districts\nfollowing each decennial census. Ala. Const., Art. IX,\n§§199–200. In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of\nthe State’s 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts.\n2012 Ala. Acts no. 602 (House plan); id., at no. 603 (Senate\nplan) (Acts). In doing so, Alabama sought to achieve\nnumerous traditional districting objectives, such as com-\npactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing\nchange, and protecting incumbents. But it placed yet\ngreater importance on achieving two other goals. See\nAlabama Legislature Reapportionment Committee Guide-\nlines in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 30–4, pp. 3–5 (Committee\nGuidelines).\n   First, it sought to minimize the extent to which a dis-\ntrict might deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely\nequal population. In particular, it set as a goal creating a\nset of districts in which no district would deviate from the\ntheoretical, precisely equal ideal by more than 1%—i.e., a\nmore rigorous deviation standard than our precedents\nhave found necessary under the Constitution. See Brown\nv. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 842 (1983) (5% deviation from\nideal generally permissible). No one here doubts the\ndesirability of a State’s efforts generally to come close to a\none-person, one-vote ideal.\n   Second, it sought to ensure compliance with federal law,\nand, in particular, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 79 Stat.\n439, as amended, 52 U. S. C. §10301 et seq. At the time of\nthe redistricting Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under\nthat Act. Accordingly §5 of the Act required Alabama to\ndemonstrate that an electoral change, such as redistrict-\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning, would not bring about retrogression in respect to\nracial minorities’ “ability . . . to elect their preferred can-\ndidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C. §10304(b). Specifically,\nAlabama believed that, to avoid retrogression under §5, it\nwas required to maintain roughly the same black popula-\ntion percentage in existing majority-minority districts.\nSee Appendix B, infra.\n   Compliance with these two goals posed particular diffi-\nculties with respect to many of the State’s 35 majority-\nminority districts (8 in the Senate, 27 in the House). That\nis because many of these districts were (compared with the\naverage district) underpopulated. In order for Senate\nDistrict 26, for example, to meet the State’s no-more-than-\n1% population-deviation objective, the State would have to\nadd about 16,000 individuals to the district. And, prior to\nredistricting, 72.75% of District 26’s population was black.\nAccordingly, Alabama’s plan added 15,785 new individ-\nuals, and only 36 of those newly added individuals were\nwhite.\n   This suit, as it appears before us, focuses in large part\nupon Alabama’s efforts to achieve these two goals. The\nCaucus and the Conference basically claim that the State,\nin adding so many new minority voters to majority-\nminority districts (and to others), went too far. They\nallege the State created a constitutionally forbidden “ra-\ncial gerrymander”—a gerrymander that (e.g., when the\nState adds more minority voters than needed for a minor-\nity group to elect a candidate of its choice) might, among\nother things, harm the very minority voters that Acts such\nas the Voting Rights Act sought to help.\n   After a bench trial, the Federal District Court held in\nfavor of the State, i.e., against the Caucus and the Confer-\nence, with respect to their racial gerrymandering claims\nas well as with respect to several other legal claims that\nthe Caucus and the Conference had made. With respect to\nracial gerrymandering, the District Court recognized that\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nelectoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause\nwhen (1) race is the “dominant and controlling” or “pre-\ndominant” consideration in deciding “to place a significant\nnumber of voters within or without a particular district,”\nMiller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913, 916 (1995), and (2)\nthe use of race is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compel-\nling state interest,” Shaw II, 517 U. S., at 902; see also\nShaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (1993) (Shaw I ) (Consti-\ntution forbids “separat[ion of] voters into different districts\non the basis of race” when the separation “lacks sufficient\njustification”); Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 958–959, 976\n(1996) (principal opinion of O’Connor, J.) (same). But,\nafter trial the District Court held (2 to 1) that the Caucus\nand the Conference had failed to prove their racial gerry-\nmandering claims. The Caucus along with the Conference\n(and several other plaintiffs) appealed. We noted probable\njurisdiction with respect to the racial gerrymandering\nclaims. 572 U. S. ___ (2014).\n   We shall focus upon four critical District Court determi-\nnations underlying its ultimate “no violation” conclusion.\nThey concern:\n   1.\t The Geographical Nature of the Racial Gerryman-\n        dering Claims. The District Court characterized\n        the appellants’ claims as falling into two categories.\n        In the District Court’s view, both appellants had ar-\n        gued “that the Acts as a whole constitute racial ger-\n        rymanders,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (MD Ala.\n        2013) (emphasis added), and one of the appellants\n        (the Conference) had also argued that the State had\n        racially gerrymandered four specific electoral dis-\n        tricts, Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26, id., at\n        1288.\n   2.\t Standing. The District Court held that the Caucus\n        had standing to argue its racial gerrymandering\n        claim with respect to the State “as a whole.” But\n        the Conference lacked standing to make any of its\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n       racial gerrymandering claims—the claim requiring\n       consideration of the State “as a whole,” and the\n       claims requiring consideration of four individual\n       Senate districts. Id., at 1292.\n   3.\t Racial Predominance. The District Court held that,\n       in any event, the appellants’ claims must fail be-\n       cause race “was not the predominant motivating\n       factor” either (a) “for the Acts as a whole” or (b) with\n       respect to “Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, or 26.” Id., at\n       1293.\n   4.\t Narrow Tailoring/Compelling State Interest. The\n       District Court also held that, even were it wrong\n       about standing and predominance, the appellants’\n       racial gerrymandering claims must fail. That is be-\n       cause any predominant use of race in the drawing of\n       electoral boundaries was “narrowly tailored” to\n       serve a “compelling state interest,” id., at 1306–\n       1307, namely the interest in avoiding retrogression\n       with respect to racial minorities’ “ability to elect\n       their preferred candidates of choice.” §10304(b).\n  In our view, each of these determinations reflects an\nerror about relevant law. And each error likely affected\nthe District Court’s conclusions—to the point where we\nmust vacate the lower court’s judgment and remand the\ncases to allow appellants to reargue their racial gerry-\nmandering claims. In light of our opinion, all parties\nremain free to introduce such further evidence as the\nDistrict Court shall reasonably find appropriate.\n                             II\n   We begin by considering the geographical nature of the\nracial gerrymandering claims. The District Court repeat-\nedly referred to the racial gerrymandering claims as\nclaims that race improperly motivated the drawing of\nboundary lines of the State considered as a whole. See,\ne.g., 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1293 (“Race was not the predomi-\n6    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnant motivating factor for the Acts as a whole”); id., at\n1287 (construing plaintiffs’ challenge as arguing that the\n“Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders”); id., at\n1292 (describing the plaintiffs’ challenge as a “claim of\nracial gerrymandering to the Acts as a whole”); cf. supra,\nat 4–5 (noting four exceptions).\n  A racial gerrymandering claim, however, applies to the\nboundaries of individual districts. It applies district-by-\ndistrict. It does not apply to a State considered as an\nundifferentiated “whole.” We have consistently described\na claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was\nimproperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or\nmore specific electoral districts. See, e.g., Shaw I, 509\nU. S., at 649 (violation consists of “separat[ing] voters into\ndifferent districts on the basis of race” (emphasis added));\nVera, 517 U. S., at 965 (principal opinion) (“[Courts] must\nscrutinize each challenged district . . .” (emphasis added)).\nWe have described the plaintiff ’s evidentiary burden\nsimilarly. See Miller, supra, at 916 (plaintiff must show\nthat “race was the predominant factor motivating the\nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of\nvoters within or without a particular district” (emphasis\nadded)).\n  Our district-specific language makes sense in light of\nthe nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerryman-\ndering claim. Those harms are personal. They include\nbeing “personally . . . subjected to [a] racial classification,”\nVera, supra, at 957 (principal opinion), as well as being\nrepresented by a legislator who believes his “primary\nobligation is to represent only the members” of a particu-\nlar racial group, Shaw I, supra, at 648. They directly\nthreaten a voter who lives in the district attacked. But\nthey do not so keenly threaten a voter who lives elsewhere\nin the State. Indeed, the latter voter normally lacks\nstanding to pursue a racial gerrymandering claim. United\nStates v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 744–745 (1995).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Voters, of course, can present statewide evidence in\norder to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular dis-\ntrict. See Miller, supra, at 916. And voters might make\nthe claim that every individual district in a State suffers\nfrom racial gerrymandering. But this latter claim is not\nthe claim that the District Court, when using the phrase\n“as a whole,” considered here. Rather, the concept as used\nhere suggests the existence of a legal unicorn, an animal\nthat exists only in the legal imagination.\n   This is not a technical, linguistic point. Nor does it\ncriticize what might seem, in effect, a slip of the pen.\nRather, here the District Court’s terminology mattered.\nThat is because the District Court found that racial crite-\nria had not predominated in the drawing of some Alabama\ndistricts. And it found that fact (the fact that race did not\npredominate in the drawing of some, or many districts)\nsufficient to defeat what it saw as the basic claim before it,\nnamely a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe State as an undifferentiated whole. See, e.g., 989\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1294 (rejecting plaintiffs’ challenge because\n“[the legislature] followed no bright-line rule” with respect\nto every majority-minority district); id., at 1298–1299,\n1301 (citing examples of majority-minority districts in\nwhich black population percentages were reduced and\nexamples of majority-white districts in which precincts\nwere split).\n   A showing that race-based criteria did not significantly\naffect the drawing of some Alabama districts, however,\nwould have done little to defeat a claim that race-based\ncriteria predominantly affected the drawing of other Ala-\nbama districts, such as Alabama’s majority-minority\ndistricts primarily at issue here. See id., at 1329 (Thomp-\nson, J., dissenting) (“[T]he drafters[’] fail[ure] to achieve\ntheir sought-after percentage in one district does not\ndetract one iota from the fact that they did achieve it in\nanother”). Thus, the District Court’s undifferentiated\n8    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatewide analysis is insufficient. And we must remand\nfor consideration of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe individual districts subject to the appellants’ racial\ngerrymandering challenges.\n   The State and principal dissent argue that (but for four\nspecifically mentioned districts) there were in effect no\nsuch districts. The Caucus and the Conference, the State\nand principal dissent say, did not seek a district-by-\ndistrict analysis. And, the State and principal dissent\nconclude that the Caucus and the Conference have conse-\nquently waived the right to any further consideration.\nBrief for Appellees 14, 31; post, at 5–12 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.).\n   We do not agree. We concede that the District Court’s\nopinion suggests that it was the Caucus and the Confer-\nence that led the Court to consider racial gerrymandering\nof the State “as a whole.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287. At\nleast the District Court interpreted their filings to allege\nonly that kind of claim. Ibid. But our review of the record\nindicates that the plaintiffs did not claim only that the\nlegislature had racially gerrymandered the State “as” an\nundifferentiated “whole.” Rather, their evidence and their\narguments embody the claim that individual majority-\nminority districts were racially gerrymandered. And those\nare the districts that we believe the District Court must\nreconsider.\n   There are 35 majority-minority districts, 27 in the\nHouse and 8 in the Senate. The District Court’s opinion\nitself refers to evidence that the legislature’s redistricting\ncommittee, in order to satisfy what it believed the Voting\nRights Act required, deliberately chose additional black\nvoters to move into underpopulated majority-minority\ndistricts, i.e., a specific set of individual districts. See, e.g.,\n989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1274 (referring to Senator Dial’s testi-\nmony that the Committee “could have used,” but did not\nuse, “white population within Jefferson County to repopu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlate the majority-black districts” because “doing so would\nhave resulted in the retrogression of the majority-black\ndistricts and potentially created a problem for [Justice\nDepartment] preclearance”); id., at 1276 (stating that\nRepresentative Jim McClendon, also committee cochair,\n“testified consistently with Senator Dial”); id., at 1277\n(noting that the committee’s expert, Randolph Hinaman,\ntestified that “he needed to add population” to majority-\nblack districts “without significantly lowering the percent-\nage of the population in each district that was majority-\nblack”).\n   The Caucus and the Conference presented much evidence\nat trial to show that that the legislature had deliberately\nmoved black voters into these majority-minority dis-\ntricts—again, a specific set of districts—in order to pre-\nvent the percentage of minority voters in each district\nfrom declining. See, e.g., Committee Guidelines 3–5; 1 Tr.\n28–29, 36–37, 55, 63, 67–68, 77, 81, 96, 115, 124, 136, 138\n(testimony of Senator Dial); Deposition of Gerald Dial in\nNo. 12–cv–691 (May 21, 2013), Doc. 123–5, pp. 17, 39–41,\n62, 100 (Dial Deposition); 3 Tr. 222 (testimony of Repre-\nsentative McClendon); id., at 118–119, 145–146, 164, 182–\n183, 186–187 (testimony of Hinaman); Deposition of Ran-\ndolph Hinaman in No. 12–cv–691 (June 25, 2013), Doc.\n134–4, pp. 23–24, 101 (Hinaman Deposition).\n   In their post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Con-\nclusions of Law, the plaintiffs stated that the evidence\nshowed a racial gerrymander with respect to the majority\nof the majority-minority districts; they referred to the\nspecific splitting of precinct and county lines in the draw-\ning of many majority-minority districts; and they pointed\nto much district-specific evidence. E.g., Alabama Legisla-\ntive Black Caucus Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing Proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–\n691, Doc. 194, pp. 9–10, 13–14, 30–35, 40 (Caucus Post-\nTrial Brief); Newton Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing Proposed\n10   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–\n691, Doc. 195, pp. 33–35, 56–61, 64–67, 69–74, 82–85, 108,\n121–122 (Conference Post-Trial Brief); see also Appendix\nA, infra (organizing these citations by district).\n   We recognize that the plaintiffs relied heavily upon\nstatewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the\ndrawing of individual district lines. See generally Caucus\nPost-Trial Brief 1, 3–7, 48–50; Conference Post-Trial Brief\n2, 44–45, 105–106. And they also sought to prove that the\nuse of race to draw the boundaries of the majority-\nminority districts affected the boundaries of other districts\nas well. See, e.g., 1 Tr. 36–37, 48, 55, 70–71, 93, 111, 124\n(testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 142, 162 (testimony of Hinaman);\nsee generally Caucus Post-Trial Brief 8–16. Such evidence\nis perfectly relevant. We have said that the plaintiff ’s\nburden in a racial gerrymandering case is “to show, either\nthrough circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and\ndemographics or more direct evidence going to legislative\npurpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating\nthe legislature’s decision to place a significant number of\nvoters within or without a particular district.” Miller, 515\nU. S., at 916. Cf. Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 258\n(2001) (explaining the plaintiff ’s burden in cases, unlike\nthese, in which the State argues that politics, not race,\nwas its predominant motive). That Alabama expressly\nadopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical\nracial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-\nperson, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated\nthe drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the\nState. And neither the use of statewide evidence nor the\neffort to show widespread effect can transform a racial\ngerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts\ninto a separate, general claim that the legislature racially\ngerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated “whole.”\n   We, like the principal dissent, recognize that the plain-\ntiffs could have presented their district-specific claims\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore clearly, post, at 6–8, 10–12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.),\nbut the dissent properly concedes that its objection would\nweaken had the Conference “developed such a claim in the\ncourse of discovery and trial.” Post, at 6. And that is just\nwhat happened.\n   In the past few pages and in Appendix A, we set forth\nthe many record references that establish this fact. The\nCaucus helps to explain the complaint omissions when it\ntells us that the plaintiffs unearthed the factual basis for\ntheir racial gerrymandering claims when they deposed the\ncommittee’s redistricting expert. See Brief for Appellants\nin No. 13–895, pp. 12–13. The State neither disputes this\nprocedural history nor objects that plaintiffs’ pleadings\nfailed to conform with the proof. Indeed, throughout, the\nplaintiffs litigated these claims not as if they were wholly\nseparate entities but as if they were a team. See, e.g.,\nCaucus Post-Trial Brief 1 (“[We] support the additional\nclaims made by the [Conference] plaintiffs”); but cf. post,\nat 3–12 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (treating separately Con-\nference claims from Caucus claims). Thus we, like the\ndissenting judge below (who also lived with these cases\nthrough trial), conclude that the record as a whole shows\nthat the plaintiffs brought, and their argument rested\nsignificantly upon, district-specific claims.       See 989\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1313 (Thompson, J., dissenting) (constru-\ning plaintiffs as also challenging “each majority-Black\nHouse and Senate District”).\n   The principal dissent adds that the Conference waived\nits district-specific claims on appeal. Cf. post, at 8. But\nthat is not so. When asked specifically about its position\nat oral argument, the Conference stated that it was rely-\ning on statewide evidence to prove its district-specific\nchallenges. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15–16. Its counsel said that\n“the exact same policy was applied in every black-majority\ndistrict,” id., at 15, and “[b]y statewide, we simply mean a\ncommon policy applied to every district in the State,” id.,\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 16. We accept the Conference’s clarification, which is\nconsistent with how it presented these claims below.\n  We consequently conclude that the District Court’s\nanalysis of racial gerrymandering of the State “as a whole”\nwas legally erroneous. We find that the appellants did not\nwaive their right to consideration of their claims as ap-\nplied to particular districts. Accordingly, we remand the\ncases. See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 291\n(1982) (remand is required when the District Court “failed\nto make a finding because of an erroneous view of the\nlaw”); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 757 (2006)\n(same).\n                               III\n   We next consider the District Court’s holding with\nrespect to standing. The District Court, sua sponte, held\nthat the Conference lacked standing—either to bring\nracial gerrymandering claims with respect to the four\nindividual districts that the court specifically considered\n(i.e., Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26) or to bring a racial\ngerrymandering claim with respect to the “State as a\nwhole.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1292.\n   The District Court recognized that ordinarily\n     “[a]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf\n     of its members when its members would have standing\n     to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are\n     germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither\n     the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires\n     individuals members’ participation in the lawsuit.”\n     Id., at 1291 (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\n     Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528\n     U. S. 167, 181 (2000); emphasis added).\nIt also recognized that a “member” of an association\n“would have standing to sue” in his or her “own right”\nwhen that member “resides in the district that he alleges\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas the product of a racial gerrymander.” 989 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1291 (citing Hays, 515 U. S., at 744–745). But, the\nDistrict Court nonetheless denied standing because it\nbelieved that the “record” did “not clearly identify the\ndistricts in which the individual members of the [Confer-\nence] reside,” and the Conference had “not proved that it\nhas members who have standing to pursue any district-\nspecific claims of racial gerrymandering.” 989 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1292.\n   The District Court conceded that Dr. Joe Reed, a repre-\nsentative of the Conference, testified that the Conference\n“has members in almost every county in Alabama.” Ibid.\nBut, the District Court went on to say that “the counties in\nAlabama are split into many districts.” Ibid. And the\n“Conference offered no testimony or evidence that it has\nmembers in all of the districts in Alabama or in any of the\n[four] specific districts that it challenged.” Ibid.\n   The record, however, lacks adequate support for the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion. Dr. Reed’s testimony sup-\nports, and nothing in that record undermines, the Confer-\nence’s own statement, in its post-trial brief, that it is a\n“statewide political caucus founded in 1960.” Conference\nPost-Trial Brief 3. It has the “purpose” of “endors[ing]\ncandidates for political office who will be responsible to the\nneeds of the blacks and other minorities and poor people.”\nId., at 3–4. These two statements (the second of which the\nprincipal dissent ignores), taken together with Dr. Reed’s\ntestimony, support an inference that the organization has\nmembers in all of the State’s majority-minority districts,\nother things being equal, which is sufficient to meet the\nConference’s burden of establishing standing. That is to\nsay, it seems highly likely that a “statewide” organization\nwith members in “almost every county,” the purpose of\nwhich is to help “blacks and other minorities and poor\npeople,” will have members in each majority-minority\ndistrict. But cf. post, at 3–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n14   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the very least, the common sense inference is strong\nenough to lead the Conference reasonably to believe that,\nin the absence of a state challenge or a court request for\nmore detailed information, it need not provide additional\ninformation such as a specific membership list. We have\nfound nothing in the record, nor has the State referred us\nto anything in the record, that suggests the contrary. Cf.\nApp. 204–205, 208 (State arguing lack of standing, not\nbecause of inadequate member residency but because an\nassociation “lives” nowhere and that the Conference\nshould join individual members). The most the State\nargued was that “[n]one of the individual [p]laintiffs [who\nbrought the case with the Conference] claims to live in”\nSenate District 11, id., at 205 (emphasis added), but the\nConference would likely not have understood that argu-\nment as a request that it provide a membership list. In\nfact, the Conference might have understood the argument\nas an indication that the State did not contest its member-\nship in every district.\n   To be sure, the District Court had an independent obli-\ngation to confirm its jurisdiction, even in the absence of a\nstate challenge. See post, at 4–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nBut, in these circumstances, elementary principles of\nprocedural fairness required that the District Court, rather\nthan acting sua sponte, give the Conference an oppor-\ntunity to provide evidence of member residence. Cf. Warth\nv. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501–502 (1975) (explaining that a\ncourt may “allow or [r]equire” a plaintiff to supplement the\nrecord to show standing and that “[i]f, after this opportu-\nnity, the plaintiff ’s standing does not adequately appear\nfrom all materials of record, the complaint must be dis-\nmissed” (emphasis added)). Moreover, we have no reason\nto believe that the Conference would have been unable to\nprovide a list of members, at least with respect to the\nmajority-minority districts, had it been asked. It has filed\njust such a list in this Court. See Affidavit of Joe L. Reed\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPursuant to this Court’s Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Conference\naffidavit listing members residing in each majority-\nminority district in the State); see also Parents Involved in\nCommunity Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S.\n701, 718 (2007) (accepting a lodged affidavit in similar\ncircumstances). Thus, the District Court on remand\nshould reconsider the Conference’s standing by permitting\nthe Conference to file its list of members and permitting\nthe State to respond, as appropriate.\n                               IV\n   The District Court held in the alternative that the\nclaims of racial gerrymandering must fail because “[r]ace\nwas not the predominant motivating factor” in the crea-\ntion of any of the challenged districts. 989 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1293. In our view, however, the District Court did not\nproperly calculate “predominance.”           In particular, it\njudged race to lack “predominance” in part because it\nplaced in the balance, among other nonracial factors,\nlegislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal\npopulation. See, e.g., id., at 1305 (the “need to bring the\nneighboring districts into compliance with the require-\nment of one person, one vote served as the primary moti-\nvating factor for the changes to [Senate] District 22” (em-\nphasis added)); id., at 1297 (the “constitutional\nrequirement of one person, one vote trumped every other\ndistricting principle”); id., at 1296 (the “record establishes\nthat the drafters of the new districts, above all, had to\ncorrect [for] severe malapportionment . . .”); id., at 1306\n(the “inclusion of additional precincts [in Senate District\n26] is a reasonable response to the underpopulation of the\nDistrict”).\n   In our view, however, an equal population goal is not\none factor among others to be weighed against the use of\nrace to determine whether race “predominates.” Rather, it\nis part of the redistricting background, taken as a given,\n16   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen determining whether race, or other factors, predom-\ninate in a legislator’s determination as to how equal popu-\nlation objectives will be met.\n   To understand this conclusion, recall what “predomi-\nnance” is about: A plaintiff pursuing a racial gerrymander-\ning claim must show that “race was the predominant\nfactor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a\nsignificant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Miller, 515 U. S., at 916. To do so, the “plaintiff\nmust prove that the legislature subordinated traditional\nrace-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considera-\ntions.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Now consider the nature of those offsetting “traditional\nrace-neutral districting principles.” We have listed several,\nincluding “compactness, contiguity, respect for political\nsubdivisions or communities defined by actual shared\ninterests,” ibid., incumbency protection, and political\naffiliation, Vera, 517 U. S., at 964, 968 (principal opinion).\n   But we have not listed equal population objectives. And\nthere is a reason for that omission. The       reason     that\nequal population objectives do not appear on this list of\n“traditional” criteria is that equal population objectives\nplay a different role in a State’s redistricting process.\nThat role is not a minor one. Indeed, in light of the Con-\nstitution’s demands, that role may often prove “predomi-\nnant” in the ordinary sense of that word. But, as the\nUnited States points out, “predominance” in the context of\na racial gerrymandering claim is special. It is not about\nwhether a legislature believes that the need for equal\npopulation takes ultimate priority. Rather, it is, as we\nsaid, whether the legislature “placed” race “above tradi-\ntional districting considerations in determining which\npersons were placed in appropriately apportioned dis-\ntricts.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (some\nemphasis added). In other words, if the legislature must\nplace 1,000 or so additional voters in a particular district\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin order to achieve an equal population goal, the “predom-\ninance” question concerns which voters the legislature\ndecides to choose, and specifically whether the legislature\npredominately uses race as opposed to other, “traditional”\nfactors when doing so.\n   Consequently, we agree with the United States that the\nrequirement that districts have approximately equal\npopulations is a background rule against which redistrict-\ning takes place. Id., at 12. It is not a factor to be treated\nlike other nonracial factors when a court determines\nwhether race predominated over other, “traditional” fac-\ntors in the drawing of district boundaries.\n   Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the\nlaw, its “predominance” conclusions, including those con-\ncerning the four districts that the Conference specifically\nchallenged, might well have been different. For example,\nonce the legislature’s “equal population” objectives are put\nto the side—i.e., seen as a background principle—then\nthere is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race\ndid predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the\nboundaries of Senate District 26, the one district that the\nparties have discussed here in depth.\n   The legislators in charge of creating the redistricting\nplan believed, and told their technical adviser, that a\nprimary redistricting goal was to maintain existing racial\npercentages in each majority-minority district, insofar as\nfeasible. See supra, at 9–10 (compiling extensive record\ntestimony in support of this point). There is considerable\nevidence that this goal had a direct and significant impact\non the drawing of at least some of District 26’s boundaries.\nSee 3 Tr. 175–180 (testimony of Hinaman); Appendix C,\ninfra (change of district’s shape from rectangular to irreg-\nular). Of the 15,785 individuals that the new redistricting\nlaws added to the population of District 26, just 36 were\nwhite—a remarkable feat given the local demographics.\nSee, e.g., 2 Tr. 127–128 (testimony of Senator Quinton\n18   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRoss); 3 Tr. 179 (testimony of Hinaman). Transgressing\ntheir own redistricting guidelines, Committee Guidelines\n3–4, the drafters split seven precincts between the majority-\nblack District 26 and the majority-white District 25,\nwith the population in those precincts clearly divided on\nracial lines. See Exh. V in Support of Newton Plaintiffs’\nOpposition to Summary Judgment in No. 12–cv–691, Doc.\n140–1, pp. 91–95. And the District Court conceded that\nrace “was a factor in the drawing of District 26,” and that\nthe legislature “preserved” “the percentage of the popula-\ntion that was black.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1306.\n   We recognize that the District Court also found, with\nrespect to District 26, that “preservi[ng] the core of the\nexisting [d]istrict,” following “county lines,” and following\n“highway lines” played an important boundary-drawing\nrole. Ibid. But the first of these (core preservation) is not\ndirectly relevant to the origin of the new district inhabit-\nants; the second (county lines) seems of marginal im-\nportance since virtually all Senate District 26 boundaries\ndeparted from county lines; and the third (highways) was\nnot mentioned in the legislative redistricting guidelines.\nCf. Committee Guidelines 3–5.\n   All this is to say that, with respect to District 26 and\nlikely others as well, had the District Court treated equal\npopulation goals as background factors, it might have\nconcluded that race was the predominant boundary-\ndrawing consideration. Thus, on remand, the District\nCourt should reconsider its “no predominance” conclusions\nwith respect to Senate District 26 and others to which our\nanalysis is applicable.\n   Finally, we note that our discussion in this section is\nlimited to correcting the District Court’s misapplication of\nthe “predominance” test for strict scrutiny discussed in\nMiller, 515 U. S., at 916. It does not express a view on the\nquestion of whether the intentional use of race in redis-\ntricting, even in the absence of proof that traditional\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)               19\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ndistricting principles were subordinated to race, triggers\nstrict scrutiny. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 996 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n                                  V\n   The District Court, in a yet further alternative holding,\nfound that “[e]ven if the [State] subordinated traditional\ndistricting principles to racial considerations,” the racial\ngerrymandering claims failed because, in any event, “the\nDistricts would satisfy strict scrutiny.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1306. In the District Court’s view, the “Acts are narrowly\ntailored to comply with Section 5” of the Voting Rights Act.\nId., at 1311. That provision “required the Legislature to\nmaintain, where feasible, the existing number of majority-\nblack districts and not substantially reduce the relative\npercentages of black voters in those districts.” Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). And, insofar as the State’s redistricting\nembodied racial considerations, it did so in order to meet\nthis §5 requirement.\n   In our view, however, this alternative holding rests\nupon a misperception of the law. Section 5, which covered\nparticular States and certain other jurisdictions, does not\nrequire a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular\nnumerical minority percentage. It requires the jurisdic-\ntion to maintain a minority’s ability to elect a preferred\ncandidate of choice. That is precisely what the language of\nthe statute says. It prohibits a covered jurisdiction from\nadopting any change that “has the purpose of or will have\nthe effect of diminishing the ability of [the minority group]\nto elect their preferred candidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C.\n§10304(b); see also §10304(d) (the “purpose of subsection\n(b) . . . is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their\npreferred candidates of choice”).\n   That is also just what Department of Justice Guidelines\nsay. The Guidelines state specifically that the Depart-\nment’s preclearance determinations are not based\n20   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     “on any predetermined or fixed demographic percent-\n     ages. . . . Rather, in the Department’s view, this de-\n     termination requires a functional analysis of the elec-\n     toral behavior within the particular jurisdiction or\n     election district. . . . [C]ensus data alone may not pro-\n     vide sufficient indicia of electoral behavior to make\n     the requisite determination.” Guidance Concerning\n     Redistricting Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n     Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7471 (2011).\nConsistent with this view, the United States tells us that\n“Section 5” does not “requir[e] the State to maintain the\nsame percentage of black voters in each of the majority-\nblack districts as had existed in the prior districting\nplans.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.\nRather, it “prohibits only those diminutions of a minority\ngroup’s proportionate strength that strip the group within\na district of its existing ability to elect its candidates of\nchoice.” Id., at 22–23. We agree. Section 5 does not re-\nquire maintaining the same population percentages in\nmajority-minority districts as in the prior plan. Rather, §5\nis satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect\ntheir preferred candidates.\n  The history of §5 further supports this view. In adopt-\ning the statutory language to which we referred above,\nCongress rejected this Court’s decision in Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, 539 U. S. 461, 480 (2003) (holding that it is not nec-\nessarily retrogressive for a State to replace safe majority-\nminority districts with crossover or influence districts),\nand it adopted the views of the dissent. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–478, pp. 68–69, and n. 183 (2006). While the thrust of\nJustice Souter’s dissent was that, in a §5 retrogression\ncase, courts should ask whether a new voting provision\nwould likely deprive minority voters of their ability to\nelect a candidate of their choice—language that Congress\nadopted in revising §5—his dissent also made clear that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts should not mechanically rely upon numerical per-\ncentages but should take account of all significant circum-\nstances. Georgia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 493, 498, 505, 509.\nAnd while the revised language of §5 may raise some\ninterpretive questions—e.g., its application to coalition,\ncrossover, and influence districts—it is clear that Congress\ndid not mandate that a 1% reduction in a 70% black popu-\nlation district would be necessarily retrogressive. See\nPersily, The Promises and Pitfalls of the New Voting\nRights Act, 117 Yale L. J. 174, 218 (2007). Indeed, Ala-\nbama’s mechanical interpretation of §5 can raise serious\nconstitutional concerns. See Miller, supra, at 926.\n   The record makes clear that both the District Court and\nthe legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numeri-\ncal view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression. See\nAppendix B, infra. And the difference between that view\nand the more purpose-oriented view reflected in the stat-\nute’s language can matter. Imagine a majority-minority\ndistrict with a 70% black population. Assume also that\nvoting in that district, like that in the State itself, is ra-\ncially polarized. And assume that the district has long\nelected to office black voters’ preferred candidate. Other\nthings being equal, it would seem highly unlikely that a\nredistricting plan that, while increasing the numerical size\nof the district, reduced the percentage of the black popula-\ntion from, say, 70% to 65% would have a significant im-\npact on the black voters’ ability to elect their preferred\ncandidate. And, for that reason, it would be difficult to\nexplain just why a plan that uses racial criteria predomi-\nnately to maintain the black population at 70% is “narrowly\ntailored” to achieve a “compelling state interest,” namely\nthe interest in preventing §5 retrogression. The cir-\ncumstances of this hypothetical example, we add, are\nclose to those characterizing Senate District 26, as set\nforth in the District Court’s opinion and throughout the\nrecord. See, e.g., 1 Tr. 131–132 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr.\n22   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n180 (testimony of Hinaman).\n   In saying this, we do not insist that a legislature guess\nprecisely what percentage reduction a court or the Justice\nDepartment might eventually find to be retrogressive. The\nlaw cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistrict-\ning, determine precisely what percent minority population\n§5 demands. The standards of §5 are complex; they often\nrequire evaluation of controverted claims about voting\nbehavior; the evidence may be unclear; and, with respect\nto any particular district, judges may disagree about the\nproper outcome. The law cannot lay a trap for an unwary\nlegislature, condemning its redistricting plan as either (1)\nunconstitutional racial gerrymandering should the legisla-\nture place a few too many minority voters in a district or\n(2) retrogressive under §5 should the legislature place a\nfew too few. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 977 (principal opin-\nion). Thus, we agree with the United States that a court’s\nanalysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only\nthat the legislature have a “strong basis in evidence” in\nsupport of the (race-based) choice that it has made. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 29 (citing Ricci v.\nDeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 585 (2009)). This standard, as\nthe United States points out, “does not demand that a\nState’s actions actually be necessary to achieve a compel-\nling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. And legisla-\ntors “may have a strong basis in evidence to use racial\nclassifications in order to comply with a statute when they\nhave good reasons to believe such use is required, even if a\ncourt does not find that the actions were necessary for\nstatutory compliance.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Here the District Court enunciated a narrow tailoring\nstandard close to the one we have just mentioned. It said\nthat a plan is “narrowly tailored . . . when the race-based\naction taken was reasonably necessary” to achieve a com-\npelling interest. 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1307 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd it held that preventing retrogression is a compel-\nling interest. Id., at 1306–1307. While we do not here\ndecide whether, given Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S.\n___ (2013), continued compliance with §5 remains a com-\npelling interest, we conclude that the District Court and\nthe legislature asked the wrong question with respect to\nnarrow tailoring. They asked: “How can we maintain\npresent minority percentages in majority-minority dis-\ntricts?” But given §5’s language, its purpose, the Justice\nDepartment Guidelines, and the relevant precedent, they\nshould have asked: “To what extent must we preserve\nexisting minority percentages in order to maintain the\nminority’s present ability to elect the candidate of its\nchoice?” Asking the wrong question may well have led to\nthe wrong answer. Hence, we cannot accept the District\nCourt’s “compelling interest/narrow tailoring” conclusion.\n                        *      *     *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is\nvacated. We note that appellants have also raised addi-\ntional questions in their jurisdictional statements, relating\nto their one-person, one-vote claims (Caucus) and vote\ndilution claims (Conference), which were also rejected by\nthe District Court. We do not pass upon these claims. The\nDistrict Court remains free to reconsider the claims should\nit find reconsideration appropriate. And the parties are\nfree to raise them, including as modified by the District\nCourt, on any further appeal.\n   The cases are remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n24   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v.

If the Court’s destination seems fantas-\ntical, just wait until you see the journey.\n   Two groups of plaintiffs, the Alabama Democratic Con-\nference and the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus,\nbrought separate challenges to the way in which Alabama\ndrew its state legislative districts following the 2010 cen-\nsus.

Even after a full trial, the District Court\nlamented that “[t]he filings and arguments made by the\nplaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court understood both groups of plaintiffs to\nargue, as relevant here, only that “the Acts as a whole\nconstitute racial gerrymanders.” Id., at 1287. It also\nunderstood the Democratic Conference to argue that\n“Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26 constitute racial gerry-\nmanders,” id., at 1288, but held that the Democratic Con-\nference lacked standing to bring “any district-specific\nclaims of racial gerrymandering,” id., at 1292 (emphasis\nadded). It then found for Alabama on the merits.\n   The Court rightly concludes that our racial gerryman-\ndering jurisprudence does not allow for statewide claims.\nAnte, at 5–12. However, rather than holding appellants to\nthe misguided legal theory they presented to the District\nCourt, it allows them to take a mulligan, remanding the\ncase with orders that the District Court consider whether\nsome (all?) of Alabama’s 35 majority-minority districts\nresult from impermissible racial gerrymandering. In\ndoing this, the Court disregards the detailed findings and\nthoroughly reasoned conclusions of the District Court—in\nparticular its determination, reached after watching the\ndevelopment of the case from complaint to trial, that no\nappellant proved (or even pleaded) district-specific claims\nwith respect to the majority-minority districts. Worse\nstill, the Court ignores the Democratic Conference’s ex-\npress waiver of these claims before this Court. It does this\non the basis of a few stray comments, cherry-picked from\ndistrict-court filings that are more Rorschach brief than\nBrandeis brief, in which the vague outline of what could be\ndistrict-specific racial-gerrymandering claims begins to\ntake shape only with the careful, post-hoc nudging of\nappellate counsel.\n   Racial gerrymandering strikes at the heart of our demo-\ncratic process, undermining the electorate’s confidence in\nits government as representative of a cohesive body politic\nin which all citizens are equal before the law. It is there-\nfore understandable, if not excusable, that the Court balks\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

But allowing appellants\na second bite at the apple invites lower courts similarly to\ndepart from the premise that ours is an adversarial sys-\ntem whenever they deem the stakes sufficiently high.\nBecause I do not believe that Article III empowers this\nCourt to act as standby counsel for sympathetic litigants, I\ndissent.\n           I. The Alabama Democratic Conference\n  The District Court concluded that the Democratic Con-\nference lacked standing to bring district-specific claims. It\ndid so on the basis of the Conference’s failure to present\nany evidence that it had members who voted in the chal-\nlenged districts, and because the individual Conference\nplaintiffs did not claim to vote in them. 989 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1292.\n  A voter has standing to bring a racial-gerrymandering\nclaim only if he votes in a gerrymandered district, or if\nspecific evidence demonstrates that he has suffered the\nspecial harms that attend racial gerrymandering. United\nStates v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 744–745 (1995). However,\nthe Democratic Conference only claimed to have “chapters\nand members in almost all counties in the state.” Newton\nPlaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 195–1, pp. 3–4 (Democratic\nConference Post-Trial Brief) (emphasis added). Yet the\nCourt concludes that this fact, combined with the Confer-\nence’s self-description as a “ ‘statewide political caucus’ ”\nthat endorses candidates for political office, “supports an\ninference that the organization has members in all of the\nState’s majority-minority districts, other things being\nequal.” Ante, at 13. The Court provides no support for\nthis theory of jurisdiction by illogical inference, perhaps\nbecause this Court has rejected other attempts to peddle\nmore-likely-than-not standing. See Summers v. Earth\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 497 (2009) (rejecting a test\nfor organizational standing that asks “whether, accepting\n[an] organization’s self-description of the activities of its\nmembers, there is a statistical probability that some of\nthose members are threatened with concrete injury”).\n   The inference to be drawn from the Conference’s state-\nments cuts in precisely the opposite direction. What is at\nissue here is not just counties but voting districts within\ncounties. If the Conference has members in almost every\ncounty, then there must be counties in which it does not\nhave members; and we have no basis for concluding (or\ninferring) that those counties do not contain all of the\nmajority-minority voting districts. Morever, even in those\ncounties in which the Conference does have members, we\nhave no basis for concluding (or inferring) that those\nmembers vote in majority-minority districts. The Confer-\nence had plenty of opportunities, including at trial, to\ndemonstrate that this was the case, and failed to do so.\nThis failure lies with the Democratic Conference, and the\nconsequences should be borne by it, not by the people of\nAlabama, who must now shoulder the expense of further\nlitigation and the uncertainty that attends a resuscitated\nconstitutional challenge to their legislative districts.\n   Incredibly, the Court thinks that “elementary principles\nof procedural fairness” require giving the Democratic\nConference the opportunity to prove on appeal what it\nneglected to prove at trial. Ante, at 14. It observes that\nthe Conference had no reason to believe it should provide\nsuch information because “the State did not contest its\nmembership in every district,” and the opinion cites an\naffidavit lodged with this Court providing a list of the\nConference’s members in each majority-minority district\nin Alabama. Ibid. I cannot imagine why the absence of a\nstate challenge would matter. Whether or not there was\nsuch a challenge, it was the Conference’s responsibility, as\n“[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction,” to establish\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstanding. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.\n555, 561 (1992). That responsibility was enforceable,\nchallenge or no, by the court: “The federal courts are un-\nder an independent obligation to examine their own juris-\ndiction, and standing ‘is perhaps the most important of\n[the jurisdictional] doctrines.’ ” FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,\n493 U. S. 215, 230–231 (1990) (citations omitted). And\nbecause standing is not a “mere pleading requiremen[t]\nbut rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff ’s case,\neach element must be supported in the same way as any\nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of\nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence re-\nquired at the successive stages of the litigation.” Defend-\ners of Wildlife, supra, at 561.\n   The Court points to Parents Involved in Community\nSchools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 718\n(2007), as support for its decision to sandbag Alabama\nwith the Democratic Conference’s out-of-time (indeed, out-\nof-court) lodging in this Court. The circumstances in that\ncase, however, are far afield. The organization of parents\nin that case had established organizational standing in the\nlower court by showing that it had members with children\nwho would be subject to the school district’s “integration\ntiebreaker,” which was applied at ninth grade. Brief for\nRespondents, O. T. 2006, No. 05–908, p. 16. By the time\nthe case reached this Court, however, the youngest of\nthese children had entered high school, and so would no\nlonger be subject to the challenged policy. Ibid. Accord-\ningly, we accepted a lodging that provided names of addi-\ntional, younger children in order to show that the organi-\nzation had not lost standing as a result of the long delay\nthat often accompanies federal litigation. Here, by con-\ntrast, the Democratic Conference’s lodging in the Supreme\nCourt is its first attempt to show that it has members in\nthe majority-minority districts. This is too little, too late.\n   But that is just the start. Even if the Democratic Con-\n6   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nference had standing to bring district-specific racial-\ngerrymandering claims, there remains the question\nwhether it did bring them. Its complaint alleged three\ncounts: (1) Violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act, (2)\nRacial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause, and (3) §1983 violations of the Voting Rights Act\nand the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Com-\nplaint in No. 2:12–cv–1081, Doc. 1, pp. 17–18. The racial\ngerrymandering count alleged that “Alabama Acts 2012-\n602 and 2012-603 were drawn for the purpose and effect of\nminimizing the opportunity of minority voters to partici-\npate effectively in the political process,” and that this\n“racial gerrymandering by Alabama Acts 2012-602 and\n2012-603 violates the rights of Plaintiffs.” Id., at 17. It\nmade no reference to specific districts that were racially\ngerrymandered; indeed, the only particular jurisdictions\nmentioned anywhere in the complaint were Senate District\n11, Senate District 22, Madison County Senate Districts,\nHouse District 73, and Jefferson and Montgomery County\nHouse Districts. None of the Senate Districts is majority-\nminority. Nor is House District 73. Jefferson County\ndoes, admittedly, contain 8 of the 27 majority-minority\nHouse Districts in Alabama, and Montgomery County\ncontains another 4, making a total of 12. But they also\ncontain 14 majority-white House Districts between them.\nIn light of this, it is difficult to understand the Court’s\nstatement that appellants’ “evidence and . . . arguments\nembody the claim that individual majority-minority dis-\ntricts were racially gerrymandered.” Ante, at 8.\n   That observation would, of course, make sense if the\nDemocratic Conference had developed such a claim in the\ncourse of discovery and trial. But in its post-trial Pro-\nposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Con-\nference hewed to its original charge of statewide racial\ngerrymandering—or, rather, it did so as much as it rea-\nsonably could without actually proposing that the Court\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfind any racial gerrymandering, statewide or otherwise.\nInstead, the Conference chose only to pursue claims that\nAlabama violated §2 of the Voting Rights Act under two\ntheories. See Democratic Conference Post-Trial Brief 91–\n103 (alleging a violation of the results prong of Voting\nRights Act §2) and 103–124 (alleging a violation of the\npurpose prong of Voting Rights Act §2).\n   To be sure, the Conference employed language and\npresented factual claims at various points in its 126-page\npost-trial brief that are evocative of a claim of racial ger-\nrymandering. But in clinging to these stray comments to\nsupport its conclusion that the Conference made district-\nspecific racial-gerrymandering claims, ante, at 9–10, the\nCourt ignores the context in which these comments ap-\npear—the context of a clear Voting Rights Act §2 claim.\nVoting Rights Act claims and racial-gerrymandering\nclaims share some of the same elements. See League of\nUnited Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399,\n514 (2006) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). Thus, allegations made in the course\nof arguing a §2 claim will often be indistinguishable from\nallegations that would be made in support of a racial-\ngerrymandering claim. The appearance of such allega-\ntions in one of the Conference’s briefs might support re-\nversal if this case came to us on appeal from the District\nCourt’s grant of a motion to dismiss. See Johnson v. City\nof Shelby, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op.,\nat 1) (noting that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “do\nnot countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect\nstatement of the legal theory supporting the claim as-\nserted”). But here the District Court held a full trial be-\nfore concluding that the Conference failed to make or prove\nany district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims with\nrespect to the majority-minority districts. In this posture,\nand on this record, I cannot agree with the Court that the\nConference’s district-specific evidence, clearly made in the\n8    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourse of arguing a §2 theory, should be read to give rise to\ndistrict-specific claims of racial gerrymandering with\nrespect to Alabama’s majority-minority districts.\n   The Court attempts to shift responsibility for the Demo-\ncratic Conference’s ill-fated statewide theory from the\nConference to the District Court, implying that it was the\n“legally erroneous” analysis of the District Court, ante, at\n12, rather than the arguments made by the Conference,\nthat conjured this “legal unicorn,” ante, at 7, so that the\nConference did not forfeit the claims that the Court now\nattributes to it, ante, at 12. I suspect this will come as a\ngreat surprise to the Conference. Whatever may have\nbeen presented to the District Court, the Conference un-\nequivocally stated in its opening brief: “Appellants chal-\nlenge Alabama’s race-based statewide redistricting policy,\nnot the design of any one particular election district.”\nBrief for Appellants in No. 13–1138, p. 2 (emphasis added).\nIt drove the point home in its reply brief: “[I]f the\nCourt were to apply a predominant-motive and narrow-\ntailoring analysis, that analysis should be applied to the\nstate’s policy, not to the design of each particular district\none-by-one.” Reply Brief in No. 11–1138, p. 7. How could\nanything be clearer? As the Court observes, the Confer-\nence attempted to walk back this unqualified description\nof its case at oral argument. Ante, at 11–12. Its assertion\nthat what it really meant to challenge was the policy as\napplied to every district (not every majority-minority\ndistrict, mind you) is not “clarification,” ante, at 12, but an\nentirely new argument—indeed, the same argument it\nexpressly disclaimed in its briefing. “We will not revive a\nforfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures\ntoward it in its reply brief.” Republic of Argentina v. NML\nCapital, Ltd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5,\nn. 2); we certainly should not do so when the issue is first\npresented at oral argument.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

The Alabama Legislative Black Caucus\n  The Court does not bother to disentangle the independ-\nent claims brought by the Black Caucus from those of the\nDemocratic Conference, but it strongly implies that both\nparties asserted racial-gerrymandering claims with re-\nspect to Alabama’s 35 majority-minority districts. As we\nhave described, the Democratic Conference brought no\nsuch claims; and the Black Caucus’s filings provide even\nweaker support for the Court’s conclusion.\n  The Black Caucus complaint contained three counts: (1)\nViolation of One Person, One Vote, see Reynolds v. Sims,\n377 U. S. 533 (1964); (2) Dilution and Isolation of Black\nVoting Strength in violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act;\nand (3) Partisan Gerrymandering. Complaint in No. 2:12–\ncv–691, Doc. 1, pp. 15–22. The failure to raise any racial-\ngerrymandering claim was not a mere oversight or the\nconsequence of inartful pleading. Indeed, in its amended\ncomplaint the Black Caucus specifically cited this Court’s\nleading racial-gerrymandering case for the proposition\nthat “traditional or neutral districting principles may not\nbe subordinated in a dominant fashion by either racial or\npartisan interests absent a compelling state interest for\ndoing so.” Amended Complaint in No. 2:12–cv–691, Doc.\n60, p. 23 (citing Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 642 (1993);\nemphasis added). This quote appears in the first para-\ngraph under the “Partisan Gerrymandering” heading, and\nclaims of subordination to racial interests are notably\nabsent from the Black Caucus complaint.\n  Racial gerrymandering was not completely ignored,\nhowever. In a brief introductory paragraph to the amended\ncomplaint, before addressing jurisdiction and venue, the\nBlack Caucus alleged that “Acts 2012-602 and 2012-\n603 are racial gerrymanders that unnecessarily minimize\npopulation deviations and violate the whole-county provi-\nsions of the Alabama Constitution with both the purpose\nand effect of minimizing black voting strength and isolat-\n10   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ning from influence in the Alabama Legislature legislators\nchosen by African Americans.” Amended Complaint, at 3.\nThis was the first and last mention of racial gerrymander-\ning, and like the Democratic Conference’s complaint, it\nfocused exclusively on the districting maps as a whole\nrather than individual districts. Moreover, even this\nallegation appears primarily concerned with the use of\nracially motivated districting as a means of violating one\nperson, one vote (by splitting counties), and §2 of the\nVoting Rights Act (by minimizing and isolating black\nvoters and legislators).\n   To the extent the Black Caucus cited particular districts\nin the body of its complaint, it did so only with respect to\nits enumerated one-person, one-vote, Voting Rights Act,\nand partisan-gerrymandering counts. See, e.g., id., at 13–\n14 (alleging that the “deviation restriction and disregard\nof the ‘whole county’ requirements . . . facilitated the\nRepublican majority’s efforts to gerrymander the district\nboundaries in Acts 2012–602 and 2012–603 for partisan\npurposes. By packing the majority-black House and Sen-\nate districts, the plans remove reliable Democratic voters\nfrom adjacent majority-white districts . . .”); id., at 36\n(“The partisan purpose of [one] gerrymander was to re-\nmove predominately black Madison County precincts to\nSD 1, avoiding a potential crossover district”); id., at 44–\n45 (asserting that “splitting Jefferson County among 11\nHouse and Senate districts” and “increasing the size of its\nlocal legislative delegation and the number of other coun-\nties whose residents elect members” of the delegation\n“dilut[es] the votes of Jefferson County residents” by\ndiminishing their ability to control county-level legislation\nin the state legislature). And even these claims were\nmade with a statewide scope in mind. Id., at 55 (“Viewed\nin their entirety, the plans in Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603\nhave the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportuni-\nties for black and white voters who support the Democratic\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nParty to elect candidates of their choice”).\n   Here again, discovery and trial failed to produce any\nclear claims with respect to the majority-minority dis-\ntricts. In a curious inversion of the Democratic Confer-\nence’s practice of pleading racial gerrymandering and then\neffectively abandoning the claims, the Black Caucus,\nwhich failed to plead racial gerrymandering, did clearly\nadvance the theory after the trial. See Alabama Legisla-\ntive Black Caucus Plaintiffs’ Post-Trial Proposed Findings\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 2:12–cv–691, Doc.\n194, pp. 48–51 (Black Caucus Post-Trial Brief). The Black\nCaucus asserted racial-gerrymandering claims in its post-\ntrial brief, but they all had a clear statewide scope. It\ncharged that Alabama “started their line drawing with the\nmajority-black districts” so as to maximize the size of their\nblack majorities, which “impacted the drawing of majority-\nwhite districts in nearly every part of the state.” Id., at\n48–49. “[R]ace was the predominant factor in drafting\nboth plans,” id., at 49, which “drove nearly every district-\ning decision,” “dilut[ing] the influence of black voters in\nthe majority-white districts,” id., at 50.\n   The Black Caucus did present district-specific evidence\nin the course of developing its other legal theories. Al-\nthough this included evidence that Alabama manipulated\nthe racial composition of certain majority-minority dis-\ntricts, it also included evidence that Alabama manipulated\nracial distributions with respect to the districting maps as\na whole, id., at 6 (“Maintaining the same high black per-\ncentages had a predominant impact on the entire plan”),\nand with respect to majority-white districts, id., at 10–11\n(“Asked why [majority-white] SD 11 was drawn in a semi-\ndonut-shape that splits St. Clair, Talladega, and Shelby\nCounties, Sen. Dial blamed that also on the need to pre-\nserve the black majorities in Jefferson County Senate\ndistricts”), and 43–44 (“Sen. Irons’ quick, ‘primative’ [sic]\nanalysis of the new [majority-white] SD 1 convinced her\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat it was designed to ‘shed’ the minority population of\nSen. Sanford’s [majority-white] SD 7 to SD 1” in order to\n“crack a minority influence district”). The Black Caucus\nwas attacking the legislative districts from every angle.\nNothing gives rise to an inference that it ever homed in on\nmajority-minority districts—or, for that matter, any par-\nticular set of districts. Indeed, the fair reading of the\nBlack Caucus’s filings is that it was presenting illustrative\nevidence in particular districts—majority-minority, minor-\nity-influence, and majority-white—in an effort to make out\na claim of statewide racial gerrymandering. The fact that\nthe Court now concludes that this is not a valid legal\ntheory does not justify its repackaging the claims for a\nsecond round of litigation.\n                      III. Conclusion\n  Frankly, I do not know what to make of appellants’\narguments. They are pleaded with such opacity that,\nsquinting hard enough, one can find them to contain just\nabout anything. This, the Court believes, justifies de-\nmanding that the District Court go back and squint harder,\nso that it may divine some new means of construing\nthe filings. This disposition is based, it seems, on the\nimplicit premise that plaintiffs only plead legally correct\ntheories. That is a silly premise. We should not reward\nthe practice of litigation by obfuscation, especially when\nwe are dealing with a well-established legal claim that\nnumerous plaintiffs have successfully brought in the past.\nSee, e.g., Amended Complaint and Motion for Preliminary\nand Permanent Injunction in Cromartie v. Hunt, No. 4:96–\ncv–104 (EDNC), Doc. 21, p. 9 (“Under the March 1997\nredistricting plan, the Twelfth District and First District\nhave boundaries which were drawn pursuant to a predom-\ninantly racial motivation,” which were “the fruit of [earlier]\nracially gerrymandered plans”). Even the complaint in\nShaw, which established a cause of action for racial ger-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          13\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrymandering, displayed greater lucidity than appellants’,\nalleging that defendants “creat[ed] two amorphous dis-\ntricts which embody a scheme for segregation of voters by\nrace in order to meet a racial quota” “totally unrelated to\nconsiderations of compactness, contiguous, and geographic\nor jurisdictional communities of interest.” Complaint and\nMotion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and for\nTemporary Restraining Order in Shaw v. Barr, No. 5:92–\ncv–202 (EDNC), Doc. 1, pp. 11–12.\n   The Court seems to acknowledge that appellants never\nfocused their racial-gerrymandering claims on Alabama’s\nmajority-minority districts. While remanding to consider\nwhether the majority-minority districts were racially\ngerrymandered, it admits that plaintiffs “basically claim\nthat the State, in adding so many new minority voters to\nmajority-minority districts (and to others), went too far.”\nAnte, at 3 (emphasis added). It further concedes that\nappellants “relied heavily upon statewide evidence,” and\nthat they “also sought to prove that the use of race to draw\nthe boundaries of the majority-minority districts affected\nthe boundaries of other districts as well.” Ante, at 10.\n   The only reason I see for the Court’s selection of the\nmajority-minority districts as the relevant set of districts\nfor the District Court to consider on remand is that this\nwas the set chosen by appellants after losing on the claim\nthey actually presented in the District Court. By playing\nalong with appellants’ choose-your-own-adventure style of\nlitigation, willingly turning back the page every time a\nstrategic decision leads to a dead-end, the Court discour-\nages careful litigation and punishes defendants who are\ndenied both notice and repose. The consequences of this\nunprincipled decision will reverberate far beyond the\nnarrow circumstances presented in this case.\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

ALABAMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nin this area continues to be infected with error.\n                               I\n   The Alabama Legislature faced a difficult situation in\nits 2010 redistricting efforts. It began with racially segre-\ngated district maps that were inherited from previous\ndecades. The maps produced by the 2001 redistricting\ncontained 27 majority-black House districts and 8 majority-\nblack Senate districts—both at the time they were\ndrawn, App. to Juris. Statement 47–48, and at the time of\nthe 2010 Census, App. 103–108. Many of these majority-\nblack districts were over 70% black when they were drawn\nin 2001, and even more were over 60% black. App. to\nJuris. Statement 47–48. Even after the 2010 Census, the\npopulation remained above 60% black in the majority of\ndistricts. App. 103–108.\n   Under the 2006 amendments to §5 of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965, Alabama was also under a federal command\nto avoid drawing new districts that would “have the effect\nof diminishing the ability” of black voters “to elect their\npreferred candidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C. §10304(b). To\ncomply with §5, the legislature adopted a policy of main-\ntaining the same percentage of black voters within each of\nthose districts as existed in the 2001 plans. See ante, at\n16. This, the districting committee thought, would pre-\nserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number\nof preferred candidates. App. to Juris. Statement 174–\n175. The Department of Justice (DOJ) apparently agreed.\nActing under its authority to administer §5 of the Voting\nRights Act, the DOJ precleared Alabama’s plans.1 Id.,\n——————\n   1 As I have previously explained, §5 of the Voting Rights Act is uncon-\n\nstitutional. See Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1). And §5 no longer applies to\nAlabama after the Court’s decision in Shelby County. See id., at ___\n(slip op., at 24) (majority opinion). Because the appellants’ claims are\nnot properly before us, however, I express no opinion on whether\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nat 9.\n   Appellants—including the Alabama Legislative Black\nCaucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference—saw\nmatters differently. They sued Alabama, and on appeal\nthey argue that the State’s redistricting plans are racially\ngerrymandered because many districts are highly packed\nwith black voters. According to appellants, black voters\nwould have more voting power if they were spread over\nmore districts rather than concentrated in the same num-\nber of districts as in previous decades. The DOJ has en-\ntered the fray in support of appellants, arguing that the\nState’s redistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the\nState focused too heavily on a single racial characteristic—\nthe number of black voters in majority-minority districts—\nwhich potentially resulted in impermissible packing of\nblack voters.\n   Like the DOJ, today’s majority sides with appellants,\nfaulting Alabama for choosing the wrong percentage of\nblacks in the State’s majority-black districts, or at least for\narriving at that percentage using the wrong reasoning. In\ndoing so, the Court—along with appellants and the DOJ—\nexacerbates a problem many years in the making. It\nseems fitting, then, to trace that history here. The prac-\ntice of creating highly packed—“safe”—majority-minority\ndistricts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence,\nwhich created a system that forces States to segregate\nvoters into districts based on the color of their skin. Ala-\nbama’s current legislative districts have their genesis in\nthe “max-black” policy that the DOJ itself applied to §5\nthroughout the 1990’s and early 2000’s.            The 2006\namendments to §5 then effectively locked in place Ala-\n\n——————\ncompliance with §5 was a compelling governmental purpose at the time\nof Alabama’s 2012 redistricting, nor do I suggest that Alabama would\nnecessarily prevail if appellants had properly raised district-specific\nclaims.\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbama’s max-black districts that were established during\nthe 1990’s and 2000’s. These three problems—a jurispru-\ndence requiring segregated districts, the distortion created\nby the DOJ’s max-black policy, and the ossifying effects of\nthe 2006 amendments—are the primary culprits in this\ncase, not Alabama’s redistricting policy. Nor does this\nCourt have clean hands.\n                               II\n   This Court created the current system of race-based\nredistricting by adopting expansive readings of §2 and §5\nof the Voting Rights Act. Both §2 and §5 prohibit States\nfrom implementing voting laws that “den[y] or abridg[e]\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.” §§10304(a),\n10301(a). But both provisions extend to only certain types\nof voting laws: any “voting qualification or prerequisite to\nvoting, or standard, practice, or procedure.” Ibid. As I\nhave previously explained, the terms “ ‘standard, practice,\nor procedure’ . . . refer only to practices that affect minor-\nity citizens’ access to the ballot,” such as literacy tests.\nHolder, 512 U. S. at 914 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nThey do not apply to “[d]istricting systems and electoral\nmechanisms that may affect the ‘weight’ given to a ballot\nduly cast and counted.” Ibid. Yet this Court has adopted\nfar-reaching interpretations of both provisions, holding\nthat they encompass legislative redistricting and other\nactions that might “dilute” the strength of minority votes.\nSee generally Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986)\n(§2 “vote dilution” challenge to legislative districting plan);\nsee also Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 583–\n587 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part).\n   The Court’s interpretation of §2 and §5 have resulted in\nchallenge after challenge to the drawing of voting districts.\nSee, e.g., Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1 (2009); League\nof United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

In pursuing “undiluted” or maximized\nminority voting power, “we have devised a remedial mech-\nanism that encourages federal courts to segregate voters\ninto racially designated districts to ensure minority elec-\ntoral success.” Holder, supra, at 892 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Section 5, the provision at issue here,\nhas been applied to require States that redistrict to main-\ntain the number of pre-existing majority-minority dis-\ntricts, in which minority voters make up a large enough\nportion of the population to be able to elect their candidate\nof choice. See, e.g., Miller, supra, at 923–927 (rejecting the\nDOJ’s policy of requiring States to increase the number of\nmajority-black districts because maintaining the same\nnumber of majority-black districts would not violate §5).\n   In order to maintain these “racially ‘safe burroughs,’ ”\nStates or courts must perpetually “divid[e] the country\ninto electoral districts along racial lines—an enterprise of\nsegregating the races into political homelands.” Holder,\nsupra, at 905 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The assumptions underlying this practice\nof creating and maintaining “safe minority districts”—\n“that members of [a] racial group must think alike and\nthat their interests are so distinct that they must be pro-\nvided a separate body of representatives”—remain “re-\n6   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v.

It did so by enforcing §5 in a man-\nner that required States, including Alabama, to create\nsupermajority-black voting districts or face denial of\npre-clearance.\n  The details of this so-called “max-black” policy were\nhighlighted in federal court during Georgia’s 1991 con-\ngressional redistricting.

S.\n28 (2000) (per curiam).\n   Following the 1990 Census, the Alabama Legislature\nbegan redrawing its state legislative districts. After sev-\neral proposals failed in the legislature, a group of plaintiffs\nsued, and the State entered into a consent decree agreeing\nto use the “Reed-Buskey” plan. 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 1309.\nThe primary designer of this plan was Dr. Joe Reed, the\ncurrent chairman of appellant Alabama Democratic Con-\nference. According to Dr. Reed, the previous plan from the\n1980’s was not “fair” because it did not achieve the num-\nber of “black-preferred” representatives that was propor-\ntionate to the percentage of blacks in the population. Id.,\nat 1310. And because of the DOJ’s max-black policy, “it\nwas widely assumed that a state could (and, according to\nDOJ, had to) draw district lines with the primary intent of\nmaximizing election of black officials.” Id., at 1310, n. 14.\n“Dr. Reed thus set out to maximize the number of black\nrepresentatives and senators elected to the legislature by\nmaximizing the number of black-majority districts.” Id.,\nat 1310. Illustrating this strategy, Alabama’s letter to the\nDOJ seeking preclearance of the Reed-Buskey plan “em-\nphasize[d] the Plan’s deliberate creation of enough majority-\nblack districts to assure nearly proportional representa-\ntion in the legislature,” ibid., n. 14 and boasted that the\nplan had created four new majority-black districts and two\nadditional majority-black Senate districts. Ibid.\n   Dr. Reed populated these districts with a percentage of\nblack residents that achieved an optimal middle ground—\na “happy medium”—between too many and too few. Id., at\n1311. Twenty-three of the twenty-seven majority-black\nHouse districts were between 60% and 70% black under\nReed’s plan, id., at 1311, and Senate District 26—one of\nthe districts at issue today—was pushed from 65% to 70%\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

And “to maintain the same relative percent-\nages of black voters in those districts,” the legislature\n“redrew the districts by shifting more black voters into the\nmajority-black districts.” App. to Juris. Statement 4. The\nState’s letters requesting preclearance of the 2001 plans\nboasted that the maps maintained the same number of\nmajority-black districts and the same (or higher) percent-\nages of black voters within those districts, other than\n“slight reductions” that were “necessary to satisfy other\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory redistricting considera-\ntions.” Letter from William H.

Although appellants\ndisclaim any argument that the State must achieve an optimal per-\ncentage of black voters in majority-black districts, id., at 35, it is clear\nthat that is what they seek: a plan that maximizes voting strength by\nmaintaining “safe” majority-minority districts while also spreading\nblack voters into other districts where they can influence elections. Id.,\nat 17–18.\n10   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nGeneral, to Voting Section Chief, Civil Rights Division,\nDepartment of Justice 7, 9 (Sept. 4, 2001) (House\ndistricts).\n  Section 5 tied the State to those districts: Under this\nCourt’s §5 precedents, States are prohibited from enacting\na redistricting plan that “would lead to a retrogression in\nthe position of racial minorities.” Beer v. United States,\n425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976). In other words, the State could\nnot retrogress from the previous plan if it wished to com-\nply with §5.\n                               IV\n   Alabama’s quandary as it attempted to redraw its legis-\nlative districts after 2010 was exacerbated by the 2006\namendments to §5. Those amendments created an inflexi-\nble definition of “retrogression” that Alabama understand-\nably took as requiring it to maintain the same percentages\nof minority voters in majority-minority districts. The\namendments thus provide the last piece of the puzzle that\nexplains why the State sought to maintain the same per-\ncentages of blacks in each majority-black district.\n   Congress passed the 2006 amendments in response to\nour attempt to define “retrogression” in Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, 539 U. S. 461. Prior to that decision, practically any\nreapportionment change could “be deemed ‘retrogressive’\nunder our vote dilution jurisprudence by a court inclined\nto find it so.” Bossier I, 520 U. S., at 490–491 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). “[A] court could strike down any reappor-\ntionment plan, either because it did not include enough\nmajority-minority districts or because it did (and thereby\ndiluted the minority vote in the remaining districts).” Id.,\nat 491. Our §5 jurisprudence thus “inevitably force[d] the\ncourts to make political judgments regarding which type of\napportionment best serves supposed minority interests—\njudgments courts are ill equipped to make.” Id., at 492.\n   We tried to pull the courts and the DOJ away from\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmaking these sorts of judgments in Georgia v. Ashcroft,\nsupra. Insofar as §5 applies to the drawing of voting\ndistricts, we held that a District Court had wrongly re-\njected Georgia’s reapportionment plan, and we adopted a\nretrogression standard that gave States flexibility in\ndetermining the percentage of black voters in each dis-\ntrict. Id., at 479–481. As we explained, “a State may\nchoose to create a certain number of ‘safe’ districts, in\nwhich it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to\nelect the candidate of their choice.” Id., at 480. Alterna-\ntively, “a State may choose to create a greater number of\ndistricts in which it is likely—although perhaps not quite\nas likely as under the benchmark plan—that minority\nvoters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.”\nIbid. We noted that “spreading out minority voters over a\ngreater number of districts creates more districts in which\nminority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candi-\ndate of their choice,” even if success is not guaranteed, and\neven if it diminished the chance of electing a representa-\ntive in some districts. Id., at 481. Thus, States would be\npermitted to make judgments about how best to prevent\nretrogression in a minority group’s voting power, including\nassessing the range of appropriate minority population\npercentages within each district. Id., at 480–481.\n   In response, Congress amended §5 and effectively over-\nruled Georgia v. Ashcroft. See 120 Stat. 577. The 2006\namendments added subsection (b), which provides:\n    “Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\n    standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting\n    that has the purpose or will have the effect of dimin-\n    ishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\n    on account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred\n    candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to\n    vote within the meaning of . . . this section.” 52\n    U. S. C. §10304(b). See §5, 120 Stat. 577.\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nThus, any change that has the effect of “diminishing the\nability” of a minority group to “elect their preferred candi-\ndate of choice” is retrogressive.\n   Some were rightly worried that the 2006 amendments\nwould impose too much inflexibility on the States as they\nsought to comply with §5. Richard Pildes, who argued on\nbehalf of the Alabama Democratic Conference in these\ncases, testified in congressional hearings on the 2006\namendments. He explained that Georgia v. Ashcroft “rec-\nognizes room . . . for some modest flexibility in Section 5,”\nand warned that if “Congress overturns Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, it will make even this limited amount of flexibility\nillegal.” Hearing on the Continuing Need for Section 5\nPre-Clearance before the Senate Committee on the Judici-\nary, 109th Congress, 2d Sess., pp. 11–12 (2006). Pildes\nalso observed that the proposed standard of “no ‘dimin-\nished ability to elect’ . . . has a rigidity and a mechanical\nquality that can lock into place minority districts in the\nsouth at populations that do not serve minority voters’\ninterests.” Id., at 12. Although this testimony says\nnothing about how §5 ought to be interpreted, it tells us\nthat the Alabama Democratic Conference’s own attorney\nbelieves that the State was subject to a “rigi[d]” and\n“mechanical” standard in determining the number of\nblack voters that must be maintained in a majority-black\ndistrict.\n                           V\n  All of this history explains Alabama’s circumstances\nwhen it attempted to redistrict after the 2010 Census.\nThe legislature began with the max-black district maps\nthat it inherited from the days of Reed-Buskey. Using\nthese inherited maps, combined with population data from\nthe 2010 Census, many of the State’s majority-black\nHouse and Senate districts were between 60% and 70%\nblack, and some were over 70%. App. to Juris. Statement\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n103–108. And the State was prohibited from drawing new\ndistricts that would “have the effect of diminishing the\nability” of blacks “to elect their preferred candidates of\nchoice.” §10304(b). The legislature thus adopted a policy\nof maintaining the same number of majority-black dis-\ntricts and roughly the same percentage of blacks within\neach of those districts. See ante, at 16.\n   The majority faults the State for taking this approach. I\ndo not pretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes\nto its sordid history of racial politics. But, today the State\nis not the one that is culpable. Its redistricting effort was\nindeed tainted, but it was tainted by our voting rights\njurisprudence and the uses to which the Voting Rights Act\nhas been put. Long ago, the DOJ and special-interest\ngroups like the ACLU hijacked the Act, and they have\nbeen using it ever since to achieve their vision of maxim-\nized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the\nvoters they purport to help. States covered by §5 have\nbeen whipsawed, first required to create “safe” majority-\nblack districts, then told not to “diminis[h]” the ability to\nelect, and now told they have been too rigid in preventing\nany “diminishing” of the ability to elect. Ante, at 17–18.\n   Worse, the majority’s solution to the appellants’ gerry-\nmandering claims requires States to analyze race even\nmore exhaustively, not less, by accounting for black voter\nregistration and turnout statistics. Ante, at 18–19. The\nmajority’s command to analyze black voting patterns en\nroute to adopting the “correct” racial quota does nothing to\nease the conflict between our color-blind Constitution and\nthe “consciously segregated districting system” the Court\nhas required in the name of equality. Holder, 512 U. S., at\n907. Although I dissent today on procedural grounds, I\nalso continue to disagree with the Court’s misguided and\ndamaging jurisprudence.\n</pre>", "id": 2788983, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2015/03/25/alabama_legislative_black_caucus_v._alabama.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2014                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 12, 2014—Decided March 25, 2015*\nIn 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State’s 105 House dis-\n  tricts and 35 Senate districts. In doing so, while Alabama sought to\n  achieve numerous traditional districting objectives—e.g., compact-\n  ness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and pro-\n  tecting incumbents—it placed yet greater importance on two goals:\n  (1) minimizing a district’s deviation from precisely equal population,\n  by keeping any deviation less than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2)\n  seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities’ “abil-\n  ity to elect their preferred candidates of choice” under §5 of the Vot-\n  ing Rights Act of 1965, 52 U. S. C. §10304(b), by maintaining roughly\n  the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority\n  districts.\n     Appellants—Alabama Legislative Black Caucus (Caucus), Alabama\n  Democratic Conference (Conference), and others—claim that Ala-\n  bama’s new district boundaries create a “racial gerrymander” in vio-\n  lation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Af-\n  ter a bench trial, the three-judge District Court ruled (2 to 1) for the\n  State. It recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Pro-\n  tection Clause when race is the “predominant” consideration in decid-\n  ing “to place a significant number of voters within or without a par-\n  ticular district,” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913, 916, and the\n  use of race is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state inter-\n  est,” Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 902 (Shaw II).\n     In ruling against appellants, it made four critical determinations:\n——————\n  *Together with No. 13–1138, Alabama Democratic Conference et al. v.\nAlabama et al., also on appeal from the same court.\n2     ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n (1) that both appellants had argued “that the Acts as a whole consti-\n tute racial gerrymanders,” and that the Conference had also argued\n that the State had racially gerrymandered Senate Districts 7, 11, 22,\n and 26; (2) that the Conference lacked standing to make its racial\n gerrymandering claims; (3) that, in any event, appellants’ claims\n must fail because race “was not the predominant motivating factor”\n in making the redistricting decisions; and (4) that, even were it\n wrong about standing and predominance, these claims must fail be-\n cause any predominant use of race was “narrowly tailored” to serve a\n “compelling state interest” in avoiding retrogression under §5.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court’s analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim\n as referring to the State “as a whole,” rather than district-by-district,\n was legally erroneous. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) This Court has consistently described a claim of racial gerry-\n mandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing\n of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts, see, e.g.,\n Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (Shaw I), and has described the\n plaintiff ’s evidentiary burden similarly, see Miller, supra, at 916.\n The Court’s district-specific language makes sense in light of the per-\n sonal nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering\n claim, see Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 957; Shaw I, supra, at 648.\n Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The District Court found the fact that racial criteria had not\n predominated in the drawing of some Alabama districts sufficient to\n defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the State as\n an undifferentiated whole. But a showing that race-based criteria did\n not significantly affect the drawing of some Alabama districts would\n have done little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria predomi-\n nantly affected the drawing of other Alabama districts. Thus, the\n District Court’s undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient,\n and the District Court must on remand consider racial gerrymander-\n ing with respect to the individual districts challenged by appellants.\n Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The Caucus and the Conference did not waive the right to fur-\n ther consideration of a district-by-district analysis. The record indi-\n cates that plaintiffs’ evidence and arguments embody the claim that\n individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered,\n and those are the districts that the District Court must reconsider.\n Although plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove\n that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines,\n neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show wide-\n spread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a\n set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the leg-\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nislature racially gerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated\n“whole.” Pp. 8–12.\n   2. The District Court also erred in deciding, sua sponte, that the\nConference lacked standing. It believed that the “record” did “not\nclearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the\n[Conference] reside.” But the Conference’s post-trial brief and the\ntestimony of a Conference representative support an inference that\nthe organization has members in all of the majority-minority dis-\ntricts, which is sufficient to meet the Conference’s burden of estab-\nlishing standing. At the very least, the Conference reasonably be-\nlieved that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for\nmore detailed information, it need not provide additional information\nsuch as a specific membership list. While the District Court had an\nindependent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, in these circum-\nstances elementary principles of procedural fairness required the\nDistrict Court, rather than acting sua sponte, to give the Conference\nan opportunity to provide evidence of member residence. On remand,\nthe District Court should permit the Conference to file its member-\nship list and the State to respond, as appropriate. Pp. 12–15.\n   3. The District Court also did not properly calculate “predomi-\nnance” in its alternative holding that “[r]ace was not the predominant\nmotivating factor” in the creation of any of the challenged districts.\nIt reached its conclusion in part because it placed in the balance,\namong other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of\napproximately equal population. An equal population goal, however,\nis not one of the “traditional” factors to be weighed against the use of\nrace to determine whether race “predominates,” see Miller, supra, at\n916. Rather, it is part of the redistricting background, taken as a\ngiven, when determining whether race, or other factors, predominate\nin a legislator’s determination as to how equal population objectives\nwill be met. Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the\nlaw, its “predominance” conclusions, including those concerning the\nfour districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well\nhave been different. For example, there is strong, perhaps over-\nwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the\nlegislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26. Pp. 15–19.\n   4. The District Court’s final alternative holding—that “the [chal-\nlenged] Districts would satisfy strict scrutiny”—rests upon a misper-\nception of the law. Section 5 does not require a covered jurisdiction to\nmaintain a particular numerical minority percentage. It requires the\njurisdiction to maintain a minority’s ability to elect a preferred can-\ndidate of choice. Pp. 19–23.\n      (a) The statute’s language, 52 U. S. C. §§10304(b), (d), and De-\npartment of Justice Guidelines make clear that §5 is satisfied if mi-\n4      ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    nority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.\n    The history of §5 further supports this view, as Congress adopted the\n    language in §5 to reject this Court’s decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft,\n    539 U. S. 461, and to accept the views of Justice Souter’s dissent—\n    that, in a §5 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new vot-\n    ing provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to\n    elect a candidate of their choice, and that courts should not mechani-\n    cally rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all\n    significant circumstances, id., at 493, 498, 505, 509. Here, both the\n    District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically\n    numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression. Pp. 19–\n    22.\n         (b) In saying this, this Court does not insist that a state legisla-\n    ture, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority\n    population §5 demands. A court’s analysis of the narrow tailoring re-\n    quirement insists only that the legislature have a “strong basis in ev-\n    idence” in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made. Brief\n    for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. Here, however, the District\n    Court and the legislature both asked the wrong question with respect\n    to narrow tailoring. They asked how to maintain the present minori-\n    ty percentages in majority-minority districts, instead of asking the\n    extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in\n    order to maintain the minority’s present ability to elect the candidate\n    of its choice.

The appeals\nfocus upon the appellants’ claims that new district bound-\naries create “racial gerrymanders” in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. See,\ne.g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 907–908 (1996) (Shaw\nII) (Fourteenth Amendment forbids use of race as “ ‘pre-\ndominant’ ” district boundary-drawing “ ‘factor’ ” unless\nboundaries are “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “ ‘compel-\nling state interest’ ” (citations omitted)). We find that the\n2    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluat-\ning the claims. We consequently vacate its decision and\nremand the cases for further proceedings.\n                               I\n   The Alabama Constitution requires the legislature to\nreapportion its State House and Senate electoral districts\nfollowing each decennial census. Ala. Const., Art. IX,\n§§199–200. In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of\nthe State’s 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts.\n2012 Ala. Acts no. 602 (House plan); id., at no. 603 (Senate\nplan) (Acts). In doing so, Alabama sought to achieve\nnumerous traditional districting objectives, such as com-\npactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing\nchange, and protecting incumbents. But it placed yet\ngreater importance on achieving two other goals. See\nAlabama Legislature Reapportionment Committee Guide-\nlines in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 30–4, pp. 3–5 (Committee\nGuidelines).\n   First, it sought to minimize the extent to which a dis-\ntrict might deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely\nequal population. In particular, it set as a goal creating a\nset of districts in which no district would deviate from the\ntheoretical, precisely equal ideal by more than 1%—i.e., a\nmore rigorous deviation standard than our precedents\nhave found necessary under the Constitution. See Brown\nv. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 842 (1983) (5% deviation from\nideal generally permissible). No one here doubts the\ndesirability of a State’s efforts generally to come close to a\none-person, one-vote ideal.\n   Second, it sought to ensure compliance with federal law,\nand, in particular, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 79 Stat.\n439, as amended, 52 U. S. C. §10301 et seq. At the time of\nthe redistricting Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under\nthat Act. Accordingly §5 of the Act required Alabama to\ndemonstrate that an electoral change, such as redistrict-\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning, would not bring about retrogression in respect to\nracial minorities’ “ability . . . to elect their preferred can-\ndidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C. §10304(b). Specifically,\nAlabama believed that, to avoid retrogression under §5, it\nwas required to maintain roughly the same black popula-\ntion percentage in existing majority-minority districts.\nSee Appendix B, infra.\n   Compliance with these two goals posed particular diffi-\nculties with respect to many of the State’s 35 majority-\nminority districts (8 in the Senate, 27 in the House). That\nis because many of these districts were (compared with the\naverage district) underpopulated. In order for Senate\nDistrict 26, for example, to meet the State’s no-more-than-\n1% population-deviation objective, the State would have to\nadd about 16,000 individuals to the district. And, prior to\nredistricting, 72.75% of District 26’s population was black.\nAccordingly, Alabama’s plan added 15,785 new individ-\nuals, and only 36 of those newly added individuals were\nwhite.\n   This suit, as it appears before us, focuses in large part\nupon Alabama’s efforts to achieve these two goals. The\nCaucus and the Conference basically claim that the State,\nin adding so many new minority voters to majority-\nminority districts (and to others), went too far. They\nallege the State created a constitutionally forbidden “ra-\ncial gerrymander”—a gerrymander that (e.g., when the\nState adds more minority voters than needed for a minor-\nity group to elect a candidate of its choice) might, among\nother things, harm the very minority voters that Acts such\nas the Voting Rights Act sought to help.\n   After a bench trial, the Federal District Court held in\nfavor of the State, i.e., against the Caucus and the Confer-\nence, with respect to their racial gerrymandering claims\nas well as with respect to several other legal claims that\nthe Caucus and the Conference had made. With respect to\nracial gerrymandering, the District Court recognized that\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nelectoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause\nwhen (1) race is the “dominant and controlling” or “pre-\ndominant” consideration in deciding “to place a significant\nnumber of voters within or without a particular district,”\nMiller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 913, 916 (1995), and (2)\nthe use of race is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compel-\nling state interest,” Shaw II, 517 U. S., at 902; see also\nShaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (1993) (Shaw I ) (Consti-\ntution forbids “separat[ion of] voters into different districts\non the basis of race” when the separation “lacks sufficient\njustification”); Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 958–959, 976\n(1996) (principal opinion of O’Connor, J.) (same). But,\nafter trial the District Court held (2 to 1) that the Caucus\nand the Conference had failed to prove their racial gerry-\nmandering claims. The Caucus along with the Conference\n(and several other plaintiffs) appealed. We noted probable\njurisdiction with respect to the racial gerrymandering\nclaims. 572 U. S. ___ (2014).\n   We shall focus upon four critical District Court determi-\nnations underlying its ultimate “no violation” conclusion.\nThey concern:\n   1.\t The Geographical Nature of the Racial Gerryman-\n        dering Claims. The District Court characterized\n        the appellants’ claims as falling into two categories.\n        In the District Court’s view, both appellants had ar-\n        gued “that the Acts as a whole constitute racial ger-\n        rymanders,” 989 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala.\n        2013) (emphasis added), and one of the appellants\n        (the Conference) had also argued that the State had\n        racially gerrymandered four specific electoral dis-\n        tricts, Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26, id., at\n        1288.\n   2.\t Standing. The District Court held that the Caucus\n        had standing to argue its racial gerrymandering\n        claim with respect to the State “as a whole.” But\n        the Conference lacked standing to make any of its\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n       racial gerrymandering claims—the claim requiring\n       consideration of the State “as a whole,” and the\n       claims requiring consideration of four individual\n       Senate districts. Id., at 1292.\n   3.\t Racial Predominance. The District Court held that,\n       in any event, the appellants’ claims must fail be-\n       cause race “was not the predominant motivating\n       factor” either (a) “for the Acts as a whole” or (b) with\n       respect to “Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, or 26.” Id., at\n       1293.\n   4.\t Narrow Tailoring/Compelling State Interest. The\n       District Court also held that, even were it wrong\n       about standing and predominance, the appellants’\n       racial gerrymandering claims must fail. That is be-\n       cause any predominant use of race in the drawing of\n       electoral boundaries was “narrowly tailored” to\n       serve a “compelling state interest,” id., at 1306–\n       1307, namely the interest in avoiding retrogression\n       with respect to racial minorities’ “ability to elect\n       their preferred candidates of choice.” §10304(b).\n  In our view, each of these determinations reflects an\nerror about relevant law. And each error likely affected\nthe District Court’s conclusions—to the point where we\nmust vacate the lower court’s judgment and remand the\ncases to allow appellants to reargue their racial gerry-\nmandering claims. In light of our opinion, all parties\nremain free to introduce such further evidence as the\nDistrict Court shall reasonably find appropriate.\n                             II\n   We begin by considering the geographical nature of the\nracial gerrymandering claims. The District Court repeat-\nedly referred to the racial gerrymandering claims as\nclaims that race improperly motivated the drawing of\nboundary lines of the State considered as a whole. See,\ne.g., 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1293 (“Race was not the predomi-\n6    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnant motivating factor for the Acts as a whole”); id., at\n1287 (construing plaintiffs’ challenge as arguing that the\n“Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders”); id., at\n1292 (describing the plaintiffs’ challenge as a “claim of\nracial gerrymandering to the Acts as a whole”); cf. supra,\nat 4–5 (noting four exceptions).\n  A racial gerrymandering claim, however, applies to the\nboundaries of individual districts. It applies district-by-\ndistrict. It does not apply to a State considered as an\nundifferentiated “whole.” We have consistently described\na claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was\nimproperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or\nmore specific electoral districts. See, e.g., Shaw I, 509\nU. S., at 649 (violation consists of “separat[ing] voters into\ndifferent districts on the basis of race” (emphasis added));\nVera, 517 U. S., at 965 (principal opinion) (“[Courts] must\nscrutinize each challenged district . . .” (emphasis added)).\nWe have described the plaintiff ’s evidentiary burden\nsimilarly. See Miller, supra, at 916 (plaintiff must show\nthat “race was the predominant factor motivating the\nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of\nvoters within or without a particular district” (emphasis\nadded)).\n  Our district-specific language makes sense in light of\nthe nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerryman-\ndering claim. Those harms are personal. They include\nbeing “personally . . . subjected to [a] racial classification,”\nVera, supra, at 957 (principal opinion), as well as being\nrepresented by a legislator who believes his “primary\nobligation is to represent only the members” of a particu-\nlar racial group, Shaw I, supra, at 648. They directly\nthreaten a voter who lives in the district attacked. But\nthey do not so keenly threaten a voter who lives elsewhere\nin the State. Indeed, the latter voter normally lacks\nstanding to pursue a racial gerrymandering claim. United\nStates v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 744–745 (1995).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Voters, of course, can present statewide evidence in\norder to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular dis-\ntrict. See Miller, supra, at 916. And voters might make\nthe claim that every individual district in a State suffers\nfrom racial gerrymandering. But this latter claim is not\nthe claim that the District Court, when using the phrase\n“as a whole,” considered here. Rather, the concept as used\nhere suggests the existence of a legal unicorn, an animal\nthat exists only in the legal imagination.\n   This is not a technical, linguistic point. Nor does it\ncriticize what might seem, in effect, a slip of the pen.\nRather, here the District Court’s terminology mattered.\nThat is because the District Court found that racial crite-\nria had not predominated in the drawing of some Alabama\ndistricts. And it found that fact (the fact that race did not\npredominate in the drawing of some, or many districts)\nsufficient to defeat what it saw as the basic claim before it,\nnamely a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe State as an undifferentiated whole. See, e.g., 989\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1294 (rejecting plaintiffs’ challenge because\n“[the legislature] followed no bright-line rule” with respect\nto every majority-minority district); id., at 1298–1299,\n1301 (citing examples of majority-minority districts in\nwhich black population percentages were reduced and\nexamples of majority-white districts in which precincts\nwere split).\n   A showing that race-based criteria did not significantly\naffect the drawing of some Alabama districts, however,\nwould have done little to defeat a claim that race-based\ncriteria predominantly affected the drawing of other Ala-\nbama districts, such as Alabama’s majority-minority\ndistricts primarily at issue here. See id., at 1329 (Thomp-\nson, J., dissenting) (“[T]he drafters[’] fail[ure] to achieve\ntheir sought-after percentage in one district does not\ndetract one iota from the fact that they did achieve it in\nanother”). Thus, the District Court’s undifferentiated\n8    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatewide analysis is insufficient. And we must remand\nfor consideration of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe individual districts subject to the appellants’ racial\ngerrymandering challenges.\n   The State and principal dissent argue that (but for four\nspecifically mentioned districts) there were in effect no\nsuch districts. The Caucus and the Conference, the State\nand principal dissent say, did not seek a district-by-\ndistrict analysis. And, the State and principal dissent\nconclude that the Caucus and the Conference have conse-\nquently waived the right to any further consideration.\nBrief for Appellees 14, 31; post, at 5–12 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.).\n   We do not agree. We concede that the District Court’s\nopinion suggests that it was the Caucus and the Confer-\nence that led the Court to consider racial gerrymandering\nof the State “as a whole.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287. At\nleast the District Court interpreted their filings to allege\nonly that kind of claim. Ibid. But our review of the record\nindicates that the plaintiffs did not claim only that the\nlegislature had racially gerrymandered the State “as” an\nundifferentiated “whole.” Rather, their evidence and their\narguments embody the claim that individual majority-\nminority districts were racially gerrymandered. And those\nare the districts that we believe the District Court must\nreconsider.\n   There are 35 majority-minority districts, 27 in the\nHouse and 8 in the Senate. The District Court’s opinion\nitself refers to evidence that the legislature’s redistricting\ncommittee, in order to satisfy what it believed the Voting\nRights Act required, deliberately chose additional black\nvoters to move into underpopulated majority-minority\ndistricts, i.e., a specific set of individual districts. See, e.g.,\n989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1274 (referring to Senator Dial’s testi-\nmony that the Committee “could have used,” but did not\nuse, “white population within Jefferson County to repopu-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlate the majority-black districts” because “doing so would\nhave resulted in the retrogression of the majority-black\ndistricts and potentially created a problem for [Justice\nDepartment] preclearance”); id., at 1276 (stating that\nRepresentative Jim McClendon, also committee cochair,\n“testified consistently with Senator Dial”); id., at 1277\n(noting that the committee’s expert, Randolph Hinaman,\ntestified that “he needed to add population” to majority-\nblack districts “without significantly lowering the percent-\nage of the population in each district that was majority-\nblack”).\n   The Caucus and the Conference presented much evidence\nat trial to show that that the legislature had deliberately\nmoved black voters into these majority-minority dis-\ntricts—again, a specific set of districts—in order to pre-\nvent the percentage of minority voters in each district\nfrom declining. See, e.g., Committee Guidelines 3–5; 1 Tr.\n28–29, 36–37, 55, 63, 67–68, 77, 81, 96, 115, 124, 136, 138\n(testimony of Senator Dial); Deposition of Gerald Dial in\nNo. 12–cv–691 (May 21, 2013), Doc. 123–5, pp. 17, 39–41,\n62, 100 (Dial Deposition); 3 Tr. 222 (testimony of Repre-\nsentative McClendon); id., at 118–119, 145–146, 164, 182–\n183, 186–187 (testimony of Hinaman); Deposition of Ran-\ndolph Hinaman in No. 12–cv–691 (June 25, 2013), Doc.\n134–4, pp. 23–24, 101 (Hinaman Deposition).\n   In their post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Con-\nclusions of Law, the plaintiffs stated that the evidence\nshowed a racial gerrymander with respect to the majority\nof the majority-minority districts; they referred to the\nspecific splitting of precinct and county lines in the draw-\ning of many majority-minority districts; and they pointed\nto much district-specific evidence. E.g., Alabama Legisla-\ntive Black Caucus Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing Proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–\n691, Doc. 194, pp. 9–10, 13–14, 30–35, 40 (Caucus Post-\nTrial Brief); Newton Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing Proposed\n10   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–\n691, Doc. 195, pp. 33–35, 56–61, 64–67, 69–74, 82–85, 108,\n121–122 (Conference Post-Trial Brief); see also Appendix\nA, infra (organizing these citations by district).\n   We recognize that the plaintiffs relied heavily upon\nstatewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the\ndrawing of individual district lines. See generally Caucus\nPost-Trial Brief 1, 3–7, 48–50; Conference Post-Trial Brief\n2, 44–45, 105–106. And they also sought to prove that the\nuse of race to draw the boundaries of the majority-\nminority districts affected the boundaries of other districts\nas well. See, e.g., 1 Tr. 36–37, 48, 55, 70–71, 93, 111, 124\n(testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 142, 162 (testimony of Hinaman);\nsee generally Caucus Post-Trial Brief 8–16. Such evidence\nis perfectly relevant. We have said that the plaintiff ’s\nburden in a racial gerrymandering case is “to show, either\nthrough circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and\ndemographics or more direct evidence going to legislative\npurpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating\nthe legislature’s decision to place a significant number of\nvoters within or without a particular district.” Miller, 515\nU. S., at 916. Cf. Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 258\n(2001) (explaining the plaintiff ’s burden in cases, unlike\nthese, in which the State argues that politics, not race,\nwas its predominant motive). That Alabama expressly\nadopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical\nracial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-\nperson, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated\nthe drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the\nState. And neither the use of statewide evidence nor the\neffort to show widespread effect can transform a racial\ngerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts\ninto a separate, general claim that the legislature racially\ngerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated “whole.”\n   We, like the principal dissent, recognize that the plain-\ntiffs could have presented their district-specific claims\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore clearly, post, at 6–8, 10–12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.),\nbut the dissent properly concedes that its objection would\nweaken had the Conference “developed such a claim in the\ncourse of discovery and trial.” Post, at 6. And that is just\nwhat happened.\n   In the past few pages and in Appendix A, we set forth\nthe many record references that establish this fact. The\nCaucus helps to explain the complaint omissions when it\ntells us that the plaintiffs unearthed the factual basis for\ntheir racial gerrymandering claims when they deposed the\ncommittee’s redistricting expert. See Brief for Appellants\nin No. 13–895, pp. 12–13. The State neither disputes this\nprocedural history nor objects that plaintiffs’ pleadings\nfailed to conform with the proof. Indeed, throughout, the\nplaintiffs litigated these claims not as if they were wholly\nseparate entities but as if they were a team. See, e.g.,\nCaucus Post-Trial Brief 1 (“[We] support the additional\nclaims made by the [Conference] plaintiffs”); but cf. post,\nat 3–12 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (treating separately Con-\nference claims from Caucus claims). Thus we, like the\ndissenting judge below (who also lived with these cases\nthrough trial), conclude that the record as a whole shows\nthat the plaintiffs brought, and their argument rested\nsignificantly upon, district-specific claims.       See 989\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1313 (Thompson, J., dissenting) (constru-\ning plaintiffs as also challenging “each majority-Black\nHouse and Senate District”).\n   The principal dissent adds that the Conference waived\nits district-specific claims on appeal. Cf. post, at 8. But\nthat is not so. When asked specifically about its position\nat oral argument, the Conference stated that it was rely-\ning on statewide evidence to prove its district-specific\nchallenges. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15–16. Its counsel said that\n“the exact same policy was applied in every black-majority\ndistrict,” id., at 15, and “[b]y statewide, we simply mean a\ncommon policy applied to every district in the State,” id.,\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 16. We accept the Conference’s clarification, which is\nconsistent with how it presented these claims below.\n  We consequently conclude that the District Court’s\nanalysis of racial gerrymandering of the State “as a whole”\nwas legally erroneous. We find that the appellants did not\nwaive their right to consideration of their claims as ap-\nplied to particular districts. Accordingly, we remand the\ncases. See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 291\n(1982) (remand is required when the District Court “failed\nto make a finding because of an erroneous view of the\nlaw”); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 757 (2006)\n(same).\n                               III\n   We next consider the District Court’s holding with\nrespect to standing. The District Court, sua sponte, held\nthat the Conference lacked standing—either to bring\nracial gerrymandering claims with respect to the four\nindividual districts that the court specifically considered\n(i.e., Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26) or to bring a racial\ngerrymandering claim with respect to the “State as a\nwhole.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1292.\n   The District Court recognized that ordinarily\n     “[a]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf\n     of its members when its members would have standing\n     to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are\n     germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither\n     the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires\n     individuals members’ participation in the lawsuit.”\n     Id., at 1291 (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\n     Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528\n     U. S. 167, 181 (2000); emphasis added).\nIt also recognized that a “member” of an association\n“would have standing to sue” in his or her “own right”\nwhen that member “resides in the district that he alleges\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwas the product of a racial gerrymander.” 989 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1291 (citing Hays, 515 U. S., at 744–745). But, the\nDistrict Court nonetheless denied standing because it\nbelieved that the “record” did “not clearly identify the\ndistricts in which the individual members of the [Confer-\nence] reside,” and the Conference had “not proved that it\nhas members who have standing to pursue any district-\nspecific claims of racial gerrymandering.” 989 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1292.\n   The District Court conceded that Dr. Joe Reed, a repre-\nsentative of the Conference, testified that the Conference\n“has members in almost every county in Alabama.” Ibid.\nBut, the District Court went on to say that “the counties in\nAlabama are split into many districts.” Ibid. And the\n“Conference offered no testimony or evidence that it has\nmembers in all of the districts in Alabama or in any of the\n[four] specific districts that it challenged.” Ibid.\n   The record, however, lacks adequate support for the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion. Dr. Reed’s testimony sup-\nports, and nothing in that record undermines, the Confer-\nence’s own statement, in its post-trial brief, that it is a\n“statewide political caucus founded in 1960.” Conference\nPost-Trial Brief 3. It has the “purpose” of “endors[ing]\ncandidates for political office who will be responsible to the\nneeds of the blacks and other minorities and poor people.”\nId., at 3–4. These two statements (the second of which the\nprincipal dissent ignores), taken together with Dr. Reed’s\ntestimony, support an inference that the organization has\nmembers in all of the State’s majority-minority districts,\nother things being equal, which is sufficient to meet the\nConference’s burden of establishing standing. That is to\nsay, it seems highly likely that a “statewide” organization\nwith members in “almost every county,” the purpose of\nwhich is to help “blacks and other minorities and poor\npeople,” will have members in each majority-minority\ndistrict. But cf. post, at 3–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n14   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   At the very least, the common sense inference is strong\nenough to lead the Conference reasonably to believe that,\nin the absence of a state challenge or a court request for\nmore detailed information, it need not provide additional\ninformation such as a specific membership list. We have\nfound nothing in the record, nor has the State referred us\nto anything in the record, that suggests the contrary. Cf.\nApp. 204–205, 208 (State arguing lack of standing, not\nbecause of inadequate member residency but because an\nassociation “lives” nowhere and that the Conference\nshould join individual members). The most the State\nargued was that “[n]one of the individual [p]laintiffs [who\nbrought the case with the Conference] claims to live in”\nSenate District 11, id., at 205 (emphasis added), but the\nConference would likely not have understood that argu-\nment as a request that it provide a membership list. In\nfact, the Conference might have understood the argument\nas an indication that the State did not contest its member-\nship in every district.\n   To be sure, the District Court had an independent obli-\ngation to confirm its jurisdiction, even in the absence of a\nstate challenge. See post, at 4–5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nBut, in these circumstances, elementary principles of\nprocedural fairness required that the District Court, rather\nthan acting sua sponte, give the Conference an oppor-\ntunity to provide evidence of member residence. Cf. Warth\nv. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501–502 (1975) (explaining that a\ncourt may “allow or [r]equire” a plaintiff to supplement the\nrecord to show standing and that “[i]f, after this opportu-\nnity, the plaintiff ’s standing does not adequately appear\nfrom all materials of record, the complaint must be dis-\nmissed” (emphasis added)). Moreover, we have no reason\nto believe that the Conference would have been unable to\nprovide a list of members, at least with respect to the\nmajority-minority districts, had it been asked. It has filed\njust such a list in this Court. See Affidavit of Joe L. Reed\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPursuant to this Court’s Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Conference\naffidavit listing members residing in each majority-\nminority district in the State); see also Parents Involved in\nCommunity Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S.\n701, 718 (2007) (accepting a lodged affidavit in similar\ncircumstances). Thus, the District Court on remand\nshould reconsider the Conference’s standing by permitting\nthe Conference to file its list of members and permitting\nthe State to respond, as appropriate.\n                               IV\n   The District Court held in the alternative that the\nclaims of racial gerrymandering must fail because “[r]ace\nwas not the predominant motivating factor” in the crea-\ntion of any of the challenged districts. 989 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1293. In our view, however, the District Court did not\nproperly calculate “predominance.”           In particular, it\njudged race to lack “predominance” in part because it\nplaced in the balance, among other nonracial factors,\nlegislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal\npopulation. See, e.g., id., at 1305 (the “need to bring the\nneighboring districts into compliance with the require-\nment of one person, one vote served as the primary moti-\nvating factor for the changes to [Senate] District 22” (em-\nphasis added)); id., at 1297 (the “constitutional\nrequirement of one person, one vote trumped every other\ndistricting principle”); id., at 1296 (the “record establishes\nthat the drafters of the new districts, above all, had to\ncorrect [for] severe malapportionment . . .”); id., at 1306\n(the “inclusion of additional precincts [in Senate District\n26] is a reasonable response to the underpopulation of the\nDistrict”).\n   In our view, however, an equal population goal is not\none factor among others to be weighed against the use of\nrace to determine whether race “predominates.” Rather, it\nis part of the redistricting background, taken as a given,\n16   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen determining whether race, or other factors, predom-\ninate in a legislator’s determination as to how equal popu-\nlation objectives will be met.\n   To understand this conclusion, recall what “predomi-\nnance” is about: A plaintiff pursuing a racial gerrymander-\ning claim must show that “race was the predominant\nfactor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a\nsignificant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Miller, 515 U. S., at 916. To do so, the “plaintiff\nmust prove that the legislature subordinated traditional\nrace-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considera-\ntions.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Now consider the nature of those offsetting “traditional\nrace-neutral districting principles.” We have listed several,\nincluding “compactness, contiguity, respect for political\nsubdivisions or communities defined by actual shared\ninterests,” ibid., incumbency protection, and political\naffiliation, Vera, 517 U. S., at 964, 968 (principal opinion).\n   But we have not listed equal population objectives. And\nthere is a reason for that omission. The       reason     that\nequal population objectives do not appear on this list of\n“traditional” criteria is that equal population objectives\nplay a different role in a State’s redistricting process.\nThat role is not a minor one. Indeed, in light of the Con-\nstitution’s demands, that role may often prove “predomi-\nnant” in the ordinary sense of that word. But, as the\nUnited States points out, “predominance” in the context of\na racial gerrymandering claim is special. It is not about\nwhether a legislature believes that the need for equal\npopulation takes ultimate priority. Rather, it is, as we\nsaid, whether the legislature “placed” race “above tradi-\ntional districting considerations in determining which\npersons were placed in appropriately apportioned dis-\ntricts.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (some\nemphasis added). In other words, if the legislature must\nplace 1,000 or so additional voters in a particular district\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin order to achieve an equal population goal, the “predom-\ninance” question concerns which voters the legislature\ndecides to choose, and specifically whether the legislature\npredominately uses race as opposed to other, “traditional”\nfactors when doing so.\n   Consequently, we agree with the United States that the\nrequirement that districts have approximately equal\npopulations is a background rule against which redistrict-\ning takes place. Id., at 12. It is not a factor to be treated\nlike other nonracial factors when a court determines\nwhether race predominated over other, “traditional” fac-\ntors in the drawing of district boundaries.\n   Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the\nlaw, its “predominance” conclusions, including those con-\ncerning the four districts that the Conference specifically\nchallenged, might well have been different. For example,\nonce the legislature’s “equal population” objectives are put\nto the side—i.e., seen as a background principle—then\nthere is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race\ndid predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the\nboundaries of Senate District 26, the one district that the\nparties have discussed here in depth.\n   The legislators in charge of creating the redistricting\nplan believed, and told their technical adviser, that a\nprimary redistricting goal was to maintain existing racial\npercentages in each majority-minority district, insofar as\nfeasible. See supra, at 9–10 (compiling extensive record\ntestimony in support of this point). There is considerable\nevidence that this goal had a direct and significant impact\non the drawing of at least some of District 26’s boundaries.\nSee 3 Tr. 175–180 (testimony of Hinaman); Appendix C,\ninfra (change of district’s shape from rectangular to irreg-\nular). Of the 15,785 individuals that the new redistricting\nlaws added to the population of District 26, just 36 were\nwhite—a remarkable feat given the local demographics.\nSee, e.g., 2 Tr. 127–128 (testimony of Senator Quinton\n18   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRoss); 3 Tr. 179 (testimony of Hinaman). Transgressing\ntheir own redistricting guidelines, Committee Guidelines\n3–4, the drafters split seven precincts between the majority-\nblack District 26 and the majority-white District 25,\nwith the population in those precincts clearly divided on\nracial lines. See Exh. V in Support of Newton Plaintiffs’\nOpposition to Summary Judgment in No. 12–cv–691, Doc.\n140–1, pp. 91–95. And the District Court conceded that\nrace “was a factor in the drawing of District 26,” and that\nthe legislature “preserved” “the percentage of the popula-\ntion that was black.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1306.\n   We recognize that the District Court also found, with\nrespect to District 26, that “preservi[ng] the core of the\nexisting [d]istrict,” following “county lines,” and following\n“highway lines” played an important boundary-drawing\nrole. Ibid. But the first of these (core preservation) is not\ndirectly relevant to the origin of the new district inhabit-\nants; the second (county lines) seems of marginal im-\nportance since virtually all Senate District 26 boundaries\ndeparted from county lines; and the third (highways) was\nnot mentioned in the legislative redistricting guidelines.\nCf. Committee Guidelines 3–5.\n   All this is to say that, with respect to District 26 and\nlikely others as well, had the District Court treated equal\npopulation goals as background factors, it might have\nconcluded that race was the predominant boundary-\ndrawing consideration. Thus, on remand, the District\nCourt should reconsider its “no predominance” conclusions\nwith respect to Senate District 26 and others to which our\nanalysis is applicable.\n   Finally, we note that our discussion in this section is\nlimited to correcting the District Court’s misapplication of\nthe “predominance” test for strict scrutiny discussed in\nMiller, 515 U. S., at 916. It does not express a view on the\nquestion of whether the intentional use of race in redis-\ntricting, even in the absence of proof that traditional\n                   Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)               19\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ndistricting principles were subordinated to race, triggers\nstrict scrutiny. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 996 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n                                  V\n   The District Court, in a yet further alternative holding,\nfound that “[e]ven if the [State] subordinated traditional\ndistricting principles to racial considerations,” the racial\ngerrymandering claims failed because, in any event, “the\nDistricts would satisfy strict scrutiny.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1306. In the District Court’s view, the “Acts are narrowly\ntailored to comply with Section 5” of the Voting Rights Act.\nId., at 1311. That provision “required the Legislature to\nmaintain, where feasible, the existing number of majority-\nblack districts and not substantially reduce the relative\npercentages of black voters in those districts.” Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). And, insofar as the State’s redistricting\nembodied racial considerations, it did so in order to meet\nthis §5 requirement.\n   In our view, however, this alternative holding rests\nupon a misperception of the law. Section 5, which covered\nparticular States and certain other jurisdictions, does not\nrequire a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular\nnumerical minority percentage. It requires the jurisdic-\ntion to maintain a minority’s ability to elect a preferred\ncandidate of choice. That is precisely what the language of\nthe statute says. It prohibits a covered jurisdiction from\nadopting any change that “has the purpose of or will have\nthe effect of diminishing the ability of [the minority group]\nto elect their preferred candidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C.\n§10304(b); see also §10304(d) (the “purpose of subsection\n(b) . . . is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their\npreferred candidates of choice”).\n   That is also just what Department of Justice Guidelines\nsay. The Guidelines state specifically that the Depart-\nment’s preclearance determinations are not based\n20   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     “on any predetermined or fixed demographic percent-\n     ages. . . . Rather, in the Department’s view, this de-\n     termination requires a functional analysis of the elec-\n     toral behavior within the particular jurisdiction or\n     election district. . . . [C]ensus data alone may not pro-\n     vide sufficient indicia of electoral behavior to make\n     the requisite determination.” Guidance Concerning\n     Redistricting Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n     Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7471 (2011).\nConsistent with this view, the United States tells us that\n“Section 5” does not “requir[e] the State to maintain the\nsame percentage of black voters in each of the majority-\nblack districts as had existed in the prior districting\nplans.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.\nRather, it “prohibits only those diminutions of a minority\ngroup’s proportionate strength that strip the group within\na district of its existing ability to elect its candidates of\nchoice.” Id., at 22–23. We agree. Section 5 does not re-\nquire maintaining the same population percentages in\nmajority-minority districts as in the prior plan. Rather, §5\nis satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect\ntheir preferred candidates.\n  The history of §5 further supports this view. In adopt-\ning the statutory language to which we referred above,\nCongress rejected this Court’s decision in Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, 539 U. S. 461, 480 (2003) (holding that it is not nec-\nessarily retrogressive for a State to replace safe majority-\nminority districts with crossover or influence districts),\nand it adopted the views of the dissent. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–478, pp. 68–69, and n. 183 (2006). While the thrust of\nJustice Souter’s dissent was that, in a §5 retrogression\ncase, courts should ask whether a new voting provision\nwould likely deprive minority voters of their ability to\nelect a candidate of their choice—language that Congress\nadopted in revising §5—his dissent also made clear that\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts should not mechanically rely upon numerical per-\ncentages but should take account of all significant circum-\nstances. Georgia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 493, 498, 505, 509.\nAnd while the revised language of §5 may raise some\ninterpretive questions—e.g., its application to coalition,\ncrossover, and influence districts—it is clear that Congress\ndid not mandate that a 1% reduction in a 70% black popu-\nlation district would be necessarily retrogressive. See\nPersily, The Promises and Pitfalls of the New Voting\nRights Act, 117 Yale L. J. 174, 218 (2007). Indeed, Ala-\nbama’s mechanical interpretation of §5 can raise serious\nconstitutional concerns. See Miller, supra, at 926.\n   The record makes clear that both the District Court and\nthe legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numeri-\ncal view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression. See\nAppendix B, infra. And the difference between that view\nand the more purpose-oriented view reflected in the stat-\nute’s language can matter. Imagine a majority-minority\ndistrict with a 70% black population. Assume also that\nvoting in that district, like that in the State itself, is ra-\ncially polarized. And assume that the district has long\nelected to office black voters’ preferred candidate. Other\nthings being equal, it would seem highly unlikely that a\nredistricting plan that, while increasing the numerical size\nof the district, reduced the percentage of the black popula-\ntion from, say, 70% to 65% would have a significant im-\npact on the black voters’ ability to elect their preferred\ncandidate. And, for that reason, it would be difficult to\nexplain just why a plan that uses racial criteria predomi-\nnately to maintain the black population at 70% is “narrowly\ntailored” to achieve a “compelling state interest,” namely\nthe interest in preventing §5 retrogression. The cir-\ncumstances of this hypothetical example, we add, are\nclose to those characterizing Senate District 26, as set\nforth in the District Court’s opinion and throughout the\nrecord. See, e.g., 1 Tr. 131–132 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr.\n22   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n180 (testimony of Hinaman).\n   In saying this, we do not insist that a legislature guess\nprecisely what percentage reduction a court or the Justice\nDepartment might eventually find to be retrogressive. The\nlaw cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistrict-\ning, determine precisely what percent minority population\n§5 demands. The standards of §5 are complex; they often\nrequire evaluation of controverted claims about voting\nbehavior; the evidence may be unclear; and, with respect\nto any particular district, judges may disagree about the\nproper outcome. The law cannot lay a trap for an unwary\nlegislature, condemning its redistricting plan as either (1)\nunconstitutional racial gerrymandering should the legisla-\nture place a few too many minority voters in a district or\n(2) retrogressive under §5 should the legislature place a\nfew too few. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 977 (principal opin-\nion). Thus, we agree with the United States that a court’s\nanalysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only\nthat the legislature have a “strong basis in evidence” in\nsupport of the (race-based) choice that it has made. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 29 (citing Ricci v.\nDeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 585 (2009)). This standard, as\nthe United States points out, “does not demand that a\nState’s actions actually be necessary to achieve a compel-\nling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. And legisla-\ntors “may have a strong basis in evidence to use racial\nclassifications in order to comply with a statute when they\nhave good reasons to believe such use is required, even if a\ncourt does not find that the actions were necessary for\nstatutory compliance.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Here the District Court enunciated a narrow tailoring\nstandard close to the one we have just mentioned. It said\nthat a plan is “narrowly tailored . . . when the race-based\naction taken was reasonably necessary” to achieve a com-\npelling interest. 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1307 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd it held that preventing retrogression is a compel-\nling interest. Id., at 1306–1307. While we do not here\ndecide whether, given Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S.\n___ (2013), continued compliance with §5 remains a com-\npelling interest, we conclude that the District Court and\nthe legislature asked the wrong question with respect to\nnarrow tailoring. They asked: “How can we maintain\npresent minority percentages in majority-minority dis-\ntricts?” But given §5’s language, its purpose, the Justice\nDepartment Guidelines, and the relevant precedent, they\nshould have asked: “To what extent must we preserve\nexisting minority percentages in order to maintain the\nminority’s present ability to elect the candidate of its\nchoice?” Asking the wrong question may well have led to\nthe wrong answer. Hence, we cannot accept the District\nCourt’s “compelling interest/narrow tailoring” conclusion.\n                        *      *     *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is\nvacated. We note that appellants have also raised addi-\ntional questions in their jurisdictional statements, relating\nto their one-person, one-vote claims (Caucus) and vote\ndilution claims (Conference), which were also rejected by\nthe District Court. We do not pass upon these claims. The\nDistrict Court remains free to reconsider the claims should\nit find reconsideration appropriate. And the parties are\nfree to raise them, including as modified by the District\nCourt, on any further appeal.\n   The cases are remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n24   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v.

If the Court’s destination seems fantas-\ntical, just wait until you see the journey.\n   Two groups of plaintiffs, the Alabama Democratic Con-\nference and the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus,\nbrought separate challenges to the way in which Alabama\ndrew its state legislative districts following the 2010 cen-\nsus. These cases were consolidated before a three-judge\nDistrict Court. Even after a full trial, the District Court\nlamented that “[t]he filings and arguments made by the\nplaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best.” 989\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala. 2013). Nevertheless, the\n2   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court understood both groups of plaintiffs to\nargue, as relevant here, only that “the Acts as a whole\nconstitute racial gerrymanders.” Id., at 1287. It also\nunderstood the Democratic Conference to argue that\n“Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26 constitute racial gerry-\nmanders,” id., at 1288, but held that the Democratic Con-\nference lacked standing to bring “any district-specific\nclaims of racial gerrymandering,” id., at 1292 (emphasis\nadded). It then found for Alabama on the merits.\n   The Court rightly concludes that our racial gerryman-\ndering jurisprudence does not allow for statewide claims.\nAnte, at 5–12. However, rather than holding appellants to\nthe misguided legal theory they presented to the District\nCourt, it allows them to take a mulligan, remanding the\ncase with orders that the District Court consider whether\nsome (all?) of Alabama’s 35 majority-minority districts\nresult from impermissible racial gerrymandering. In\ndoing this, the Court disregards the detailed findings and\nthoroughly reasoned conclusions of the District Court—in\nparticular its determination, reached after watching the\ndevelopment of the case from complaint to trial, that no\nappellant proved (or even pleaded) district-specific claims\nwith respect to the majority-minority districts. Worse\nstill, the Court ignores the Democratic Conference’s ex-\npress waiver of these claims before this Court. It does this\non the basis of a few stray comments, cherry-picked from\ndistrict-court filings that are more Rorschach brief than\nBrandeis brief, in which the vague outline of what could be\ndistrict-specific racial-gerrymandering claims begins to\ntake shape only with the careful, post-hoc nudging of\nappellate counsel.\n   Racial gerrymandering strikes at the heart of our demo-\ncratic process, undermining the electorate’s confidence in\nits government as representative of a cohesive body politic\nin which all citizens are equal before the law. It is there-\nfore understandable, if not excusable, that the Court balks\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nat denying merits review simply because appellants pur-\nsued a flawed litigation strategy. But allowing appellants\na second bite at the apple invites lower courts similarly to\ndepart from the premise that ours is an adversarial sys-\ntem whenever they deem the stakes sufficiently high.\nBecause I do not believe that Article III empowers this\nCourt to act as standby counsel for sympathetic litigants, I\ndissent.\n           I. The Alabama Democratic Conference\n  The District Court concluded that the Democratic Con-\nference lacked standing to bring district-specific claims. It\ndid so on the basis of the Conference’s failure to present\nany evidence that it had members who voted in the chal-\nlenged districts, and because the individual Conference\nplaintiffs did not claim to vote in them. 989 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1292.\n  A voter has standing to bring a racial-gerrymandering\nclaim only if he votes in a gerrymandered district, or if\nspecific evidence demonstrates that he has suffered the\nspecial harms that attend racial gerrymandering. United\nStates v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 744–745 (1995). However,\nthe Democratic Conference only claimed to have “chapters\nand members in almost all counties in the state.” Newton\nPlaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 195–1, pp. 3–4 (Democratic\nConference Post-Trial Brief) (emphasis added). Yet the\nCourt concludes that this fact, combined with the Confer-\nence’s self-description as a “ ‘statewide political caucus’ ”\nthat endorses candidates for political office, “supports an\ninference that the organization has members in all of the\nState’s majority-minority districts, other things being\nequal.” Ante, at 13. The Court provides no support for\nthis theory of jurisdiction by illogical inference, perhaps\nbecause this Court has rejected other attempts to peddle\nmore-likely-than-not standing. See Summers v. Earth\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. 488, 497 (2009) (rejecting a test\nfor organizational standing that asks “whether, accepting\n[an] organization’s self-description of the activities of its\nmembers, there is a statistical probability that some of\nthose members are threatened with concrete injury”).\n   The inference to be drawn from the Conference’s state-\nments cuts in precisely the opposite direction. What is at\nissue here is not just counties but voting districts within\ncounties. If the Conference has members in almost every\ncounty, then there must be counties in which it does not\nhave members; and we have no basis for concluding (or\ninferring) that those counties do not contain all of the\nmajority-minority voting districts. Morever, even in those\ncounties in which the Conference does have members, we\nhave no basis for concluding (or inferring) that those\nmembers vote in majority-minority districts. The Confer-\nence had plenty of opportunities, including at trial, to\ndemonstrate that this was the case, and failed to do so.\nThis failure lies with the Democratic Conference, and the\nconsequences should be borne by it, not by the people of\nAlabama, who must now shoulder the expense of further\nlitigation and the uncertainty that attends a resuscitated\nconstitutional challenge to their legislative districts.\n   Incredibly, the Court thinks that “elementary principles\nof procedural fairness” require giving the Democratic\nConference the opportunity to prove on appeal what it\nneglected to prove at trial. Ante, at 14. It observes that\nthe Conference had no reason to believe it should provide\nsuch information because “the State did not contest its\nmembership in every district,” and the opinion cites an\naffidavit lodged with this Court providing a list of the\nConference’s members in each majority-minority district\nin Alabama. Ibid. I cannot imagine why the absence of a\nstate challenge would matter. Whether or not there was\nsuch a challenge, it was the Conference’s responsibility, as\n“[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction,” to establish\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstanding. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.\n555, 561 (1992). That responsibility was enforceable,\nchallenge or no, by the court: “The federal courts are un-\nder an independent obligation to examine their own juris-\ndiction, and standing ‘is perhaps the most important of\n[the jurisdictional] doctrines.’ ” FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,\n493 U. S. 215, 230–231 (1990) (citations omitted). And\nbecause standing is not a “mere pleading requiremen[t]\nbut rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff ’s case,\neach element must be supported in the same way as any\nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of\nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence re-\nquired at the successive stages of the litigation.” Defend-\ners of Wildlife, supra, at 561.\n   The Court points to Parents Involved in Community\nSchools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 718\n(2007), as support for its decision to sandbag Alabama\nwith the Democratic Conference’s out-of-time (indeed, out-\nof-court) lodging in this Court. The circumstances in that\ncase, however, are far afield. The organization of parents\nin that case had established organizational standing in the\nlower court by showing that it had members with children\nwho would be subject to the school district’s “integration\ntiebreaker,” which was applied at ninth grade. Brief for\nRespondents, O. T. 2006, No. 05–908, p. 16. By the time\nthe case reached this Court, however, the youngest of\nthese children had entered high school, and so would no\nlonger be subject to the challenged policy. Ibid. Accord-\ningly, we accepted a lodging that provided names of addi-\ntional, younger children in order to show that the organi-\nzation had not lost standing as a result of the long delay\nthat often accompanies federal litigation. Here, by con-\ntrast, the Democratic Conference’s lodging in the Supreme\nCourt is its first attempt to show that it has members in\nthe majority-minority districts. This is too little, too late.\n   But that is just the start. Even if the Democratic Con-\n6   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nference had standing to bring district-specific racial-\ngerrymandering claims, there remains the question\nwhether it did bring them. Its complaint alleged three\ncounts: (1) Violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act, (2)\nRacial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause, and (3) §1983 violations of the Voting Rights Act\nand the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Com-\nplaint in No. 2:12–cv–1081, Doc. 1, pp. 17–18. The racial\ngerrymandering count alleged that “Alabama Acts 2012-\n602 and 2012-603 were drawn for the purpose and effect of\nminimizing the opportunity of minority voters to partici-\npate effectively in the political process,” and that this\n“racial gerrymandering by Alabama Acts 2012-602 and\n2012-603 violates the rights of Plaintiffs.” Id., at 17. It\nmade no reference to specific districts that were racially\ngerrymandered; indeed, the only particular jurisdictions\nmentioned anywhere in the complaint were Senate District\n11, Senate District 22, Madison County Senate Districts,\nHouse District 73, and Jefferson and Montgomery County\nHouse Districts. None of the Senate Districts is majority-\nminority. Nor is House District 73. Jefferson County\ndoes, admittedly, contain 8 of the 27 majority-minority\nHouse Districts in Alabama, and Montgomery County\ncontains another 4, making a total of 12. But they also\ncontain 14 majority-white House Districts between them.\nIn light of this, it is difficult to understand the Court’s\nstatement that appellants’ “evidence and . . . arguments\nembody the claim that individual majority-minority dis-\ntricts were racially gerrymandered.” Ante, at 8.\n   That observation would, of course, make sense if the\nDemocratic Conference had developed such a claim in the\ncourse of discovery and trial. But in its post-trial Pro-\nposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Con-\nference hewed to its original charge of statewide racial\ngerrymandering—or, rather, it did so as much as it rea-\nsonably could without actually proposing that the Court\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfind any racial gerrymandering, statewide or otherwise.\nInstead, the Conference chose only to pursue claims that\nAlabama violated §2 of the Voting Rights Act under two\ntheories. See Democratic Conference Post-Trial Brief 91–\n103 (alleging a violation of the results prong of Voting\nRights Act §2) and 103–124 (alleging a violation of the\npurpose prong of Voting Rights Act §2).\n   To be sure, the Conference employed language and\npresented factual claims at various points in its 126-page\npost-trial brief that are evocative of a claim of racial ger-\nrymandering. But in clinging to these stray comments to\nsupport its conclusion that the Conference made district-\nspecific racial-gerrymandering claims, ante, at 9–10, the\nCourt ignores the context in which these comments ap-\npear—the context of a clear Voting Rights Act §2 claim.\nVoting Rights Act claims and racial-gerrymandering\nclaims share some of the same elements. See League of\nUnited Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399,\n514 (2006) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). Thus, allegations made in the course\nof arguing a §2 claim will often be indistinguishable from\nallegations that would be made in support of a racial-\ngerrymandering claim. The appearance of such allega-\ntions in one of the Conference’s briefs might support re-\nversal if this case came to us on appeal from the District\nCourt’s grant of a motion to dismiss. See Johnson v. City\nof Shelby, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op.,\nat 1) (noting that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “do\nnot countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect\nstatement of the legal theory supporting the claim as-\nserted”). But here the District Court held a full trial be-\nfore concluding that the Conference failed to make or prove\nany district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims with\nrespect to the majority-minority districts. In this posture,\nand on this record, I cannot agree with the Court that the\nConference’s district-specific evidence, clearly made in the\n8    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourse of arguing a §2 theory, should be read to give rise to\ndistrict-specific claims of racial gerrymandering with\nrespect to Alabama’s majority-minority districts.\n   The Court attempts to shift responsibility for the Demo-\ncratic Conference’s ill-fated statewide theory from the\nConference to the District Court, implying that it was the\n“legally erroneous” analysis of the District Court, ante, at\n12, rather than the arguments made by the Conference,\nthat conjured this “legal unicorn,” ante, at 7, so that the\nConference did not forfeit the claims that the Court now\nattributes to it, ante, at 12. I suspect this will come as a\ngreat surprise to the Conference. Whatever may have\nbeen presented to the District Court, the Conference un-\nequivocally stated in its opening brief: “Appellants chal-\nlenge Alabama’s race-based statewide redistricting policy,\nnot the design of any one particular election district.”\nBrief for Appellants in No. 13–1138, p. 2 (emphasis added).\nIt drove the point home in its reply brief: “[I]f the\nCourt were to apply a predominant-motive and narrow-\ntailoring analysis, that analysis should be applied to the\nstate’s policy, not to the design of each particular district\none-by-one.” Reply Brief in No. 11–1138, p. 7. How could\nanything be clearer? As the Court observes, the Confer-\nence attempted to walk back this unqualified description\nof its case at oral argument. Ante, at 11–12. Its assertion\nthat what it really meant to challenge was the policy as\napplied to every district (not every majority-minority\ndistrict, mind you) is not “clarification,” ante, at 12, but an\nentirely new argument—indeed, the same argument it\nexpressly disclaimed in its briefing. “We will not revive a\nforfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures\ntoward it in its reply brief.” Republic of Argentina v. NML\nCapital, Ltd., 573 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 5,\nn. 2); we certainly should not do so when the issue is first\npresented at oral argument.\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n        II. The Alabama Legislative Black Caucus\n  The Court does not bother to disentangle the independ-\nent claims brought by the Black Caucus from those of the\nDemocratic Conference, but it strongly implies that both\nparties asserted racial-gerrymandering claims with re-\nspect to Alabama’s 35 majority-minority districts. As we\nhave described, the Democratic Conference brought no\nsuch claims; and the Black Caucus’s filings provide even\nweaker support for the Court’s conclusion.\n  The Black Caucus complaint contained three counts: (1)\nViolation of One Person, One Vote, see Reynolds v. Sims,\n377 U. S. 533 (1964); (2) Dilution and Isolation of Black\nVoting Strength in violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act;\nand (3) Partisan Gerrymandering. Complaint in No. 2:12–\ncv–691, Doc. 1, pp. 15–22. The failure to raise any racial-\ngerrymandering claim was not a mere oversight or the\nconsequence of inartful pleading. Indeed, in its amended\ncomplaint the Black Caucus specifically cited this Court’s\nleading racial-gerrymandering case for the proposition\nthat “traditional or neutral districting principles may not\nbe subordinated in a dominant fashion by either racial or\npartisan interests absent a compelling state interest for\ndoing so.” Amended Complaint in No. 2:12–cv–691, Doc.\n60, p. 23 (citing Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 642 (1993);\nemphasis added). This quote appears in the first para-\ngraph under the “Partisan Gerrymandering” heading, and\nclaims of subordination to racial interests are notably\nabsent from the Black Caucus complaint.\n  Racial gerrymandering was not completely ignored,\nhowever. In a brief introductory paragraph to the amended\ncomplaint, before addressing jurisdiction and venue, the\nBlack Caucus alleged that “Acts 2012-602 and 2012-\n603 are racial gerrymanders that unnecessarily minimize\npopulation deviations and violate the whole-county provi-\nsions of the Alabama Constitution with both the purpose\nand effect of minimizing black voting strength and isolat-\n10   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ning from influence in the Alabama Legislature legislators\nchosen by African Americans.” Amended Complaint, at 3.\nThis was the first and last mention of racial gerrymander-\ning, and like the Democratic Conference’s complaint, it\nfocused exclusively on the districting maps as a whole\nrather than individual districts. Moreover, even this\nallegation appears primarily concerned with the use of\nracially motivated districting as a means of violating one\nperson, one vote (by splitting counties), and §2 of the\nVoting Rights Act (by minimizing and isolating black\nvoters and legislators).\n   To the extent the Black Caucus cited particular districts\nin the body of its complaint, it did so only with respect to\nits enumerated one-person, one-vote, Voting Rights Act,\nand partisan-gerrymandering counts. See, e.g., id., at 13–\n14 (alleging that the “deviation restriction and disregard\nof the ‘whole county’ requirements . . . facilitated the\nRepublican majority’s efforts to gerrymander the district\nboundaries in Acts 2012–602 and 2012–603 for partisan\npurposes. By packing the majority-black House and Sen-\nate districts, the plans remove reliable Democratic voters\nfrom adjacent majority-white districts . . .”); id., at 36\n(“The partisan purpose of [one] gerrymander was to re-\nmove predominately black Madison County precincts to\nSD 1, avoiding a potential crossover district”); id., at 44–\n45 (asserting that “splitting Jefferson County among 11\nHouse and Senate districts” and “increasing the size of its\nlocal legislative delegation and the number of other coun-\nties whose residents elect members” of the delegation\n“dilut[es] the votes of Jefferson County residents” by\ndiminishing their ability to control county-level legislation\nin the state legislature). And even these claims were\nmade with a statewide scope in mind. Id., at 55 (“Viewed\nin their entirety, the plans in Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603\nhave the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportuni-\nties for black and white voters who support the Democratic\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nParty to elect candidates of their choice”).\n   Here again, discovery and trial failed to produce any\nclear claims with respect to the majority-minority dis-\ntricts. In a curious inversion of the Democratic Confer-\nence’s practice of pleading racial gerrymandering and then\neffectively abandoning the claims, the Black Caucus,\nwhich failed to plead racial gerrymandering, did clearly\nadvance the theory after the trial. See Alabama Legisla-\ntive Black Caucus Plaintiffs’ Post-Trial Proposed Findings\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 2:12–cv–691, Doc.\n194, pp. 48–51 (Black Caucus Post-Trial Brief). The Black\nCaucus asserted racial-gerrymandering claims in its post-\ntrial brief, but they all had a clear statewide scope. It\ncharged that Alabama “started their line drawing with the\nmajority-black districts” so as to maximize the size of their\nblack majorities, which “impacted the drawing of majority-\nwhite districts in nearly every part of the state.” Id., at\n48–49. “[R]ace was the predominant factor in drafting\nboth plans,” id., at 49, which “drove nearly every district-\ning decision,” “dilut[ing] the influence of black voters in\nthe majority-white districts,” id., at 50.\n   The Black Caucus did present district-specific evidence\nin the course of developing its other legal theories. Al-\nthough this included evidence that Alabama manipulated\nthe racial composition of certain majority-minority dis-\ntricts, it also included evidence that Alabama manipulated\nracial distributions with respect to the districting maps as\na whole, id., at 6 (“Maintaining the same high black per-\ncentages had a predominant impact on the entire plan”),\nand with respect to majority-white districts, id., at 10–11\n(“Asked why [majority-white] SD 11 was drawn in a semi-\ndonut-shape that splits St. Clair, Talladega, and Shelby\nCounties, Sen. Dial blamed that also on the need to pre-\nserve the black majorities in Jefferson County Senate\ndistricts”), and 43–44 (“Sen. Irons’ quick, ‘primative’ [sic]\nanalysis of the new [majority-white] SD 1 convinced her\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat it was designed to ‘shed’ the minority population of\nSen. Sanford’s [majority-white] SD 7 to SD 1” in order to\n“crack a minority influence district”). The Black Caucus\nwas attacking the legislative districts from every angle.\nNothing gives rise to an inference that it ever homed in on\nmajority-minority districts—or, for that matter, any par-\nticular set of districts. Indeed, the fair reading of the\nBlack Caucus’s filings is that it was presenting illustrative\nevidence in particular districts—majority-minority, minor-\nity-influence, and majority-white—in an effort to make out\na claim of statewide racial gerrymandering. The fact that\nthe Court now concludes that this is not a valid legal\ntheory does not justify its repackaging the claims for a\nsecond round of litigation.\n                      III. Conclusion\n  Frankly, I do not know what to make of appellants’\narguments. They are pleaded with such opacity that,\nsquinting hard enough, one can find them to contain just\nabout anything. This, the Court believes, justifies de-\nmanding that the District Court go back and squint harder,\nso that it may divine some new means of construing\nthe filings. This disposition is based, it seems, on the\nimplicit premise that plaintiffs only plead legally correct\ntheories. That is a silly premise. We should not reward\nthe practice of litigation by obfuscation, especially when\nwe are dealing with a well-established legal claim that\nnumerous plaintiffs have successfully brought in the past.\nSee, e.g., Amended Complaint and Motion for Preliminary\nand Permanent Injunction in Cromartie v. Hunt, No. 4:96–\ncv–104 (EDNC), Doc. 21, p. 9 (“Under the March 1997\nredistricting plan, the Twelfth District and First District\nhave boundaries which were drawn pursuant to a predom-\ninantly racial motivation,” which were “the fruit of [earlier]\nracially gerrymandered plans”).

Barr, No. 5:92–\ncv–202 (EDNC), Doc. 1, pp. 11–12.\n   The Court seems to acknowledge that appellants never\nfocused their racial-gerrymandering claims on Alabama’s\nmajority-minority districts. While remanding to consider\nwhether the majority-minority districts were racially\ngerrymandered, it admits that plaintiffs “basically claim\nthat the State, in adding so many new minority voters to\nmajority-minority districts (and to others), went too far.”\nAnte, at 3 (emphasis added). It further concedes that\nappellants “relied heavily upon statewide evidence,” and\nthat they “also sought to prove that the use of race to draw\nthe boundaries of the majority-minority districts affected\nthe boundaries of other districts as well.” Ante, at 10.\n   The only reason I see for the Court’s selection of the\nmajority-minority districts as the relevant set of districts\nfor the District Court to consider on remand is that this\nwas the set chosen by appellants after losing on the claim\nthey actually presented in the District Court. By playing\nalong with appellants’ choose-your-own-adventure style of\nlitigation, willingly turning back the page every time a\nstrategic decision leads to a dead-end, the Court discour-\nages careful litigation and punishes defendants who are\ndenied both notice and repose. The consequences of this\nunprincipled decision will reverberate far beyond the\nnarrow circumstances presented in this case.\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n                 Cite as: 575 U.

These con-\nsolidated cases are yet another installment in the “disas-\ntrous misadventure” of this Court’s voting rights jurispru-\ndence. Id., at 893. We have somehow arrived at a place\nwhere the parties agree that Alabama’s legislative dis-\ntricts should be fine-tuned to achieve some “optimal”\nresult with respect to black voting power; the only dis-\nagreement is about what percentage of blacks should be\nplaced in those optimized districts.

ALABAMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nin this area continues to be infected with error.\n                               I\n   The Alabama Legislature faced a difficult situation in\nits 2010 redistricting efforts. It began with racially segre-\ngated district maps that were inherited from previous\ndecades. The maps produced by the 2001 redistricting\ncontained 27 majority-black House districts and 8 majority-\nblack Senate districts—both at the time they were\ndrawn, App. to Juris. Statement 47–48, and at the time of\nthe 2010 Census, App. 103–108. Many of these majority-\nblack districts were over 70% black when they were drawn\nin 2001, and even more were over 60% black. App. to\nJuris. Statement 47–48. Even after the 2010 Census, the\npopulation remained above 60% black in the majority of\ndistricts. App. 103–108.\n   Under the 2006 amendments to §5 of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965, Alabama was also under a federal command\nto avoid drawing new districts that would “have the effect\nof diminishing the ability” of black voters “to elect their\npreferred candidates of choice.” 52 U. S. C. §10304(b). To\ncomply with §5, the legislature adopted a policy of main-\ntaining the same percentage of black voters within each of\nthose districts as existed in the 2001 plans. See ante, at\n16. This, the districting committee thought, would pre-\nserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number\nof preferred candidates. App. to Juris. Statement 174–\n175. The Department of Justice (DOJ) apparently agreed.\nActing under its authority to administer §5 of the Voting\nRights Act, the DOJ precleared Alabama’s plans.1 Id.,\n——————\n   1 As I have previously explained, §5 of the Voting Rights Act is uncon-\n\nstitutional. See Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1). And §5 no longer applies to\nAlabama after the Court’s decision in Shelby County. See id., at ___\n(slip op., at 24) (majority opinion). Because the appellants’ claims are\nnot properly before us, however, I express no opinion on whether\n                    Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                   3\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nat 9.\n   Appellants—including the Alabama Legislative Black\nCaucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference—saw\nmatters differently. They sued Alabama, and on appeal\nthey argue that the State’s redistricting plans are racially\ngerrymandered because many districts are highly packed\nwith black voters. According to appellants, black voters\nwould have more voting power if they were spread over\nmore districts rather than concentrated in the same num-\nber of districts as in previous decades. The DOJ has en-\ntered the fray in support of appellants, arguing that the\nState’s redistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the\nState focused too heavily on a single racial characteristic—\nthe number of black voters in majority-minority districts—\nwhich potentially resulted in impermissible packing of\nblack voters.\n   Like the DOJ, today’s majority sides with appellants,\nfaulting Alabama for choosing the wrong percentage of\nblacks in the State’s majority-black districts, or at least for\narriving at that percentage using the wrong reasoning. In\ndoing so, the Court—along with appellants and the DOJ—\nexacerbates a problem many years in the making. It\nseems fitting, then, to trace that history here. The prac-\ntice of creating highly packed—“safe”—majority-minority\ndistricts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence,\nwhich created a system that forces States to segregate\nvoters into districts based on the color of their skin. Ala-\nbama’s current legislative districts have their genesis in\nthe “max-black” policy that the DOJ itself applied to §5\nthroughout the 1990’s and early 2000’s.            The 2006\namendments to §5 then effectively locked in place Ala-\n\n——————\ncompliance with §5 was a compelling governmental purpose at the time\nof Alabama’s 2012 redistricting, nor do I suggest that Alabama would\nnecessarily prevail if appellants had properly raised district-specific\nclaims.\n4    ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbama’s max-black districts that were established during\nthe 1990’s and 2000’s. These three problems—a jurispru-\ndence requiring segregated districts, the distortion created\nby the DOJ’s max-black policy, and the ossifying effects of\nthe 2006 amendments—are the primary culprits in this\ncase, not Alabama’s redistricting policy. Nor does this\nCourt have clean hands.\n                               II\n   This Court created the current system of race-based\nredistricting by adopting expansive readings of §2 and §5\nof the Voting Rights Act. Both §2 and §5 prohibit States\nfrom implementing voting laws that “den[y] or abridg[e]\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.” §§10304(a),\n10301(a). But both provisions extend to only certain types\nof voting laws: any “voting qualification or prerequisite to\nvoting, or standard, practice, or procedure.” Ibid. As I\nhave previously explained, the terms “ ‘standard, practice,\nor procedure’ . . . refer only to practices that affect minor-\nity citizens’ access to the ballot,” such as literacy tests.\nHolder, 512 U. S. at 914 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nThey do not apply to “[d]istricting systems and electoral\nmechanisms that may affect the ‘weight’ given to a ballot\nduly cast and counted.” Ibid. Yet this Court has adopted\nfar-reaching interpretations of both provisions, holding\nthat they encompass legislative redistricting and other\nactions that might “dilute” the strength of minority votes.\nSee generally Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986)\n(§2 “vote dilution” challenge to legislative districting plan);\nsee also Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 583–\n587 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part).\n   The Court’s interpretation of §2 and §5 have resulted in\nchallenge after challenge to the drawing of voting districts.\nSee, e.g., Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1 (2009); League\nof United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399\n                  Cite as: 575 U.

In pursuing “undiluted” or maximized\nminority voting power, “we have devised a remedial mech-\nanism that encourages federal courts to segregate voters\ninto racially designated districts to ensure minority elec-\ntoral success.” Holder, supra, at 892 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Section 5, the provision at issue here,\nhas been applied to require States that redistrict to main-\ntain the number of pre-existing majority-minority dis-\ntricts, in which minority voters make up a large enough\nportion of the population to be able to elect their candidate\nof choice. See, e.g., Miller, supra, at 923–927 (rejecting the\nDOJ’s policy of requiring States to increase the number of\nmajority-black districts because maintaining the same\nnumber of majority-black districts would not violate §5).\n   In order to maintain these “racially ‘safe burroughs,’ ”\nStates or courts must perpetually “divid[e] the country\ninto electoral districts along racial lines—an enterprise of\nsegregating the races into political homelands.” Holder,\nsupra, at 905 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The assumptions underlying this practice\nof creating and maintaining “safe minority districts”—\n“that members of [a] racial group must think alike and\nthat their interests are so distinct that they must be pro-\nvided a separate body of representatives”—remain “re-\n6   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v.

And, as predicted,\nthe States’ compliance efforts have “embroil[ed] the courts\nin a lengthy process of attempting to undo, or at least to\nminimize, the damage wrought by the system we created.”\nId., at 905. It is this fateful system that has produced\nthese cases.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n  In tandem with our flawed jurisprudence, the DOJ has\nplayed a significant role in creating Alabama’s current\nredistricting problem. It did so by enforcing §5 in a man-\nner that required States, including Alabama, to create\nsupermajority-black voting districts or face denial of\npre-clearance.\n  The details of this so-called “max-black” policy were\nhighlighted in federal court during Georgia’s 1991 con-\ngressional redistricting.     See Johnson v. Miller, 864\nF. Supp. 1354, 1360–1361 (SD Ga. 1994). On behalf of the\nBlack Caucus of the Georgia General Assembly, the Amer-\nican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) submitted a redistrict-\ning proposal to the Georgia Legislature that became\nknown as the “max-black plan.” Id., at 1360. The ACLU’s\nmap created two new “black” districts and “further maxim-\nized black voting strength by pushing the percentage of\nblack voters within its majority-black districts as high as\npossible.” Id., at 1361 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The DOJ denied several of Georgia’s proposals on the\nground that they did not include enough majority-black\ndistricts. Id., at 1366. The plan it finally approved was\nsubstantially similar to the ACLU’s max-black proposal,\nid., at 1364–1366, creating three majority-black districts,\nwith total black populations of 56.63%, 62.27%, and\n                    Cite as: 575 U.

North Carolina, for example, sub-\nmitted a congressional redistricting plan after the 1990\nCensus, but the DOJ rejected it because it did not create a\nnew majority-minority district, and thus “appear[ed] to\nminimize minority voting strength.” Shaw v. Barr, 808\nF. Supp. 461, 463–464 (EDNC 1992) (quoting Letter from\nJohn R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General of N. C., Civil\nRights Div., to Tiare B. Smiley, Special Deputy Attorney\nGeneral of N. C. 4 (Dec. 18, 1991)). The DOJ likewise\npressured Louisiana to create a new majority-black dis-\ntrict when the State sought approval of its congressional\nredistricting plan following the 1990 Census. See Hays v.\nLouisiana, 839 F. Supp. 1188, 1190 (WD La. 1993), va-\ncated on other grounds by Louisiana v. Hays, 512 U. S. 1230\n(1994).\n   Although we eventually rejected the DOJ’s max-black\npolicy, see Miller, supra, at 924–927, much damage to the\nStates’ congressional and legislative district maps had\nalready been done. In those States that had enacted\ndistricting plans in accordance with the DOJ’s max-black\npolicy, the prohibition on retrogression under §5 meant\nthat the legislatures were effectively required to maintain\nthose max-black plans during any subsequent redistrict-\ning. That is what happened in Alabama.\n                           B\n Alabama’s 2010 redistricting plans were modeled after\nmax-black-inspired plans that the State put in place in the\n——————\n   2 The District Court found it “unclear whether DOJ’s maximization\n\npolicy was driven more by [the ACLU’s] advocacy or DOJ’s own mis-\nguided reading of the Voting Rights Act,” and it concluded that the\n“considerable influence of ACLU advocacy on the voting rights decisions\nof the United States Attorney General is an embarrassment.” Johnson\nv.

See generally\nKelley v. Bennett, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1301 (MD Ala. 2000),\nvacated on other grounds by Sinkfield v. Kelley, 531 U. S.\n28 (2000) (per curiam).\n   Following the 1990 Census, the Alabama Legislature\nbegan redrawing its state legislative districts. After sev-\neral proposals failed in the legislature, a group of plaintiffs\nsued, and the State entered into a consent decree agreeing\nto use the “Reed-Buskey” plan. 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 1309.\nThe primary designer of this plan was Dr. Joe Reed, the\ncurrent chairman of appellant Alabama Democratic Con-\nference. According to Dr. Reed, the previous plan from the\n1980’s was not “fair” because it did not achieve the num-\nber of “black-preferred” representatives that was propor-\ntionate to the percentage of blacks in the population. Id.,\nat 1310. And because of the DOJ’s max-black policy, “it\nwas widely assumed that a state could (and, according to\nDOJ, had to) draw district lines with the primary intent of\nmaximizing election of black officials.” Id., at 1310, n. 14.\n“Dr. Reed thus set out to maximize the number of black\nrepresentatives and senators elected to the legislature by\nmaximizing the number of black-majority districts.” Id.,\nat 1310. Illustrating this strategy, Alabama’s letter to the\nDOJ seeking preclearance of the Reed-Buskey plan “em-\nphasize[d] the Plan’s deliberate creation of enough majority-\nblack districts to assure nearly proportional representa-\ntion in the legislature,” ibid., n. 14 and boasted that the\nplan had created four new majority-black districts and two\nadditional majority-black Senate districts. Ibid.\n   Dr. Reed populated these districts with a percentage of\nblack residents that achieved an optimal middle ground—\na “happy medium”—between too many and too few. Id., at\n1311. Twenty-three of the twenty-seven majority-black\nHouse districts were between 60% and 70% black under\nReed’s plan, id., at 1311, and Senate District 26—one of\nthe districts at issue today—was pushed from 65% to 70%\n                      Cite as: 575 U.

Id., at 1315.3 A District Court struck down several\ndistricts created in the Reed-Buskey plan as unconstitu-\ntionally based on race. Id., at 1324. This Court reversed,\nhowever, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing be-\ncause they did not live in the gerrymandered districts.\nSinkfield, supra, at 30–31.\n   The Reed-Buskey plan thus went into effect and provided\nthe template for the State’s next redistricting efforts in\n2001. See Montiel v. Davis, 215 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1282\n(SD Ala. 2002). The 2001 maps maintained the same\nnumber of majority-black districts as the Reed-Buskey\nplan had created: 27 House districts and 8 Senate dis-\ntricts. Ibid. And “to maintain the same relative percent-\nages of black voters in those districts,” the legislature\n“redrew the districts by shifting more black voters into the\nmajority-black districts.” App. to Juris. Statement 4. The\nState’s letters requesting preclearance of the 2001 plans\nboasted that the maps maintained the same number of\nmajority-black districts and the same (or higher) percent-\nages of black voters within those districts, other than\n“slight reductions” that were “necessary to satisfy other\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory redistricting considera-\ntions.” Letter from William H.

Although appellants\ndisclaim any argument that the State must achieve an optimal per-\ncentage of black voters in majority-black districts, id., at 35, it is clear\nthat that is what they seek: a plan that maximizes voting strength by\nmaintaining “safe” majority-minority districts while also spreading\nblack voters into other districts where they can influence elections.

United States,\n425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976). In other words, the State could\nnot retrogress from the previous plan if it wished to com-\nply with §5.\n                               IV\n   Alabama’s quandary as it attempted to redraw its legis-\nlative districts after 2010 was exacerbated by the 2006\namendments to §5. Those amendments created an inflexi-\nble definition of “retrogression” that Alabama understand-\nably took as requiring it to maintain the same percentages\nof minority voters in majority-minority districts. The\namendments thus provide the last piece of the puzzle that\nexplains why the State sought to maintain the same per-\ncentages of blacks in each majority-black district.\n   Congress passed the 2006 amendments in response to\nour attempt to define “retrogression” in Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, 539 U. S. 461. Prior to that decision, practically any\nreapportionment change could “be deemed ‘retrogressive’\nunder our vote dilution jurisprudence by a court inclined\nto find it so.” Bossier I, 520 U. S., at 490–491 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). “[A] court could strike down any reappor-\ntionment plan, either because it did not include enough\nmajority-minority districts or because it did (and thereby\ndiluted the minority vote in the remaining districts).” Id.,\nat 491. Our §5 jurisprudence thus “inevitably force[d] the\ncourts to make political judgments regarding which type of\napportionment best serves supposed minority interests—\njudgments courts are ill equipped to make.” Id., at 492.\n   We tried to pull the courts and the DOJ away from\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmaking these sorts of judgments in Georgia v. Ashcroft,\nsupra. Insofar as §5 applies to the drawing of voting\ndistricts, we held that a District Court had wrongly re-\njected Georgia’s reapportionment plan, and we adopted a\nretrogression standard that gave States flexibility in\ndetermining the percentage of black voters in each dis-\ntrict. Id., at 479–481. As we explained, “a State may\nchoose to create a certain number of ‘safe’ districts, in\nwhich it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to\nelect the candidate of their choice.” Id., at 480. Alterna-\ntively, “a State may choose to create a greater number of\ndistricts in which it is likely—although perhaps not quite\nas likely as under the benchmark plan—that minority\nvoters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.”\nIbid. We noted that “spreading out minority voters over a\ngreater number of districts creates more districts in which\nminority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candi-\ndate of their choice,” even if success is not guaranteed, and\neven if it diminished the chance of electing a representa-\ntive in some districts. Id., at 481. Thus, States would be\npermitted to make judgments about how best to prevent\nretrogression in a minority group’s voting power, including\nassessing the range of appropriate minority population\npercentages within each district. Id., at 480–481.\n   In response, Congress amended §5 and effectively over-\nruled Georgia v. Ashcroft. See 120 Stat. 577. The 2006\namendments added subsection (b), which provides:\n    “Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\n    standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting\n    that has the purpose or will have the effect of dimin-\n    ishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\n    on account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred\n    candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to\n    vote within the meaning of . . . this section.” 52\n    U. S. C. §10304(b). See §5, 120 Stat. 577.\n12   ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nThus, any change that has the effect of “diminishing the\nability” of a minority group to “elect their preferred candi-\ndate of choice” is retrogressive.\n   Some were rightly worried that the 2006 amendments\nwould impose too much inflexibility on the States as they\nsought to comply with §5. Richard Pildes, who argued on\nbehalf of the Alabama Democratic Conference in these\ncases, testified in congressional hearings on the 2006\namendments. He explained that Georgia v. Ashcroft “rec-\nognizes room . . . for some modest flexibility in Section 5,”\nand warned that if “Congress overturns Georgia v. Ash-\ncroft, it will make even this limited amount of flexibility\nillegal.” Hearing on the Continuing Need for Section 5\nPre-Clearance before the Senate Committee on the Judici-\nary, 109th Congress, 2d Sess., pp. 11–12 (2006). Pildes\nalso observed that the proposed standard of “no ‘dimin-\nished ability to elect’ . . . has a rigidity and a mechanical\nquality that can lock into place minority districts in the\nsouth at populations that do not serve minority voters’\ninterests.” Id., at 12. Although this testimony says\nnothing about how §5 ought to be interpreted, it tells us\nthat the Alabama Democratic Conference’s own attorney\nbelieves that the State was subject to a “rigi[d]” and\n“mechanical” standard in determining the number of\nblack voters that must be maintained in a majority-black\ndistrict.\n                           V\n  All of this history explains Alabama’s circumstances\nwhen it attempted to redistrict after the 2010 Census.\nThe legislature began with the max-black district maps\nthat it inherited from the days of Reed-Buskey. Using\nthese inherited maps, combined with population data from\nthe 2010 Census, many of the State’s majority-black\nHouse and Senate districts were between 60% and 70%\nblack, and some were over 70%. App. to Juris. Statement\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)           13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n103–108. And the State was prohibited from drawing new\ndistricts that would “have the effect of diminishing the\nability” of blacks “to elect their preferred candidates of\nchoice.” §10304(b). The legislature thus adopted a policy\nof maintaining the same number of majority-black dis-\ntricts and roughly the same percentage of blacks within\neach of those districts. See ante, at 16.\n   The majority faults the State for taking this approach. I\ndo not pretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes\nto its sordid history of racial politics. But, today the State\nis not the one that is culpable. Its redistricting effort was\nindeed tainted, but it was tainted by our voting rights\njurisprudence and the uses to which the Voting Rights Act\nhas been put. Long ago, the DOJ and special-interest\ngroups like the ACLU hijacked the Act, and they have\nbeen using it ever since to achieve their vision of maxim-\nized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the\nvoters they purport to help. States covered by §5 have\nbeen whipsawed, first required to create “safe” majority-\nblack districts, then told not to “diminis[h]” the ability to\nelect, and now told they have been too rigid in preventing\nany “diminishing” of the ability to elect. Ante, at 17–18.\n   Worse, the majority’s solution to the appellants’ gerry-\nmandering claims requires States to analyze race even\nmore exhaustively, not less, by accounting for black voter\nregistration and turnout statistics. Ante, at 18–19. The\nmajority’s command to analyze black voting patterns en\nroute to adopting the “correct” racial quota does nothing to\nease the conflict between our color-blind Constitution and\nthe “consciously segregated districting system” the Court\nhas required in the name of equality. Holder, 512 U. S., at\n907. Although I dissent today on procedural grounds, I\nalso continue to disagree with the Court’s misguided and\ndamaging jurisprudence.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2788983/", "sha1": "5367bb66155effaf3a0499895d720839d1d086b8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2015-03-25T08:01:19.503950"}
