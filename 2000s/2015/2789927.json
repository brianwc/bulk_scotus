CORY DONALD\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 14\u2013618.   Decided March 30, 2015\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief if the\nunderlying state-court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or in\u00ad\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by\u201d this Court. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). Here, the Sixth Circuit held that respondent\nCory Donald\u2019s attorney provided per se ineffective assis\u00ad\ntance of counsel under United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.\n648 (1984), when he was briefly absent during testimony\nconcerning other defendants. Because no decision from\nthis Court clearly establishes that Donald is entitled to\nrelief under Cronic, we reverse.\n                             I\n  After a day of drinking and smoking marijuana, Cory\nDonald and four others\u2014Seante Liggins, Rashad Moore,\nDewayne Saine, and Fawzi Zaya\u2014decided to rob a drug\ndealer named Mohammed Makki. Donald, Moore, and\nLiggins drove to Makki\u2019s home in Dearborn, Michigan,\nwearing black skull caps and coats. Moore and Donald\nentered the house, while Liggins waited in the car.\n  Michael McGinnis, one of Makki\u2019s drug runners, was in\nthe house at the time. When Donald and Moore came\nthrough the door, McGinnis raised his hands and dropped\nface-down to the floor. He heard a scuffle in the kitchen\nand two gunshots as someone said, \u201c \u2018[L]et it go.\u2019 \u201d Donald\nv. Rapelje, 580 Fed. Appx. 277, 279 (CA6 2014). After\nthat, McGinnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while\nsomeone rifled through his pockets saying, \u201c \u2018[W]hat you\n2                    WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ngot, what you got?\u2019 \u201d Donald v. Rapelje, 2012 WL 6047130,\n*3 (ED Mich., Dec. 5, 2012). He also heard one of the two\nmen whisper to the other, \u201c \u2018I got shot, I got shot.\u2019 \u201d 580\nFed. Appx., at 279. After Moore and Donald left, McGin\u00ad\nnis found Makki slumped against the refrigerator dying.\n   About seven minutes after they entered the house,\nMoore and Donald returned, guns in hand, to Liggins\u2019 car.\nDonald told the others that he had stolen $320 and that\nMoore had accidentally shot him during the crime. That\nnight, Donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound\nto his foot. Police arrested him about three weeks later.\n   The State charged Donald with one count of first-degree\nfelony murder and two counts of armed robbery. Liggins\nand Zaya pleaded guilty, and Donald was tried with Moore\nand Saine. His defense theory was that he was present at\nthe scene of the crime but he did not participate. At trial,\nthe government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone\ncalls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and\nZaya. Moore and Saine\u2019s attorneys objected, but Donald\u2019s\nattorney declined, saying: \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t have a dog in this race.\nIt does not affect me at all.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 280. The court admit\u00ad\nted the exhibit and took a short recess.\n   When the trial resumed, Donald\u2019s counsel was not in the\ncourtroom. At first, the judge indicated that he would\nwait for the attorney. But he then decided to proceed\nbecause Donald\u2019s counsel had already indicated that the\nexhibit and testimony did not apply to his client. About 10\nminutes later, the lawyer returned. The judge informed\nhim that \u201c \u2018up until that point we only were discussing the\ntelephone chart,\u2019 \u201d to which the attorney replied, \u201c \u2018[ Y ]es,\nyour Honor, and as I had indicated on the record, I had no\ndog in the race and no interest in that.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   The jury found Donald guilty on all three counts. He\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment for the felony-murder\ncount and to concurrent prison terms of 10\u00bd to 20 years\nfor each of the armed robbery counts. On appeal, Donald\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nargued that he was entitled to a new trial because his\nattorney\u2019s absence during the phone call testimony denied\nhim his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected his\nclaim, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied review.\n   The United States District Court for the Eastern Dis\u00ad\ntrict of Michigan granted federal habeas relief, and the\nSixth Circuit affirmed. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nMichigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was both contrary to\nand involved an unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Cronic. In the normal course, defendants\nclaiming ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the\nfamiliar framework of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668, 687 (1984), which requires a showing that \u201ccounsel\u2019s\nperformance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient perfor\u00ad\nmance prejudiced the defense.\u201d And when reviewing an\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, \u201ca court must\nindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assis\u00ad\ntance.\u201d Id., at 689.\n   In Cronic, however, we held that courts may presume\nthat a defendant has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if\nhe \u201cis denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 659. And in Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 696\n(2002), we characterized a \u201ccritical stage\u201d as one that \u201cheld\nsignificant consequences for the accused.\u201d According to\nthe Sixth Circuit, these statements should have compelled\nthe Michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony\nwas a \u201ccritical stage\u201d and that counsel\u2019s absence consti\u00ad\ntuted per se ineffective assistance. Without identifying any\ndecision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth Circuit\nconcluded that the relevant testimony in this case was\n\u201csimilar to\u201d our cases applying Cronic. 580 Fed. Appx., at\n284.\n4                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n                                 II\n\n                                 A\n\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court may\ngrant habeas relief only when a state court\u2019s decision on\nthe merits was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter\u00ad\nmined by\u201d decisions from this Court, or was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). Donald does not argue that the state-court\ndecision in his case was factually erroneous. Instead, he\nargues that the decision was both contrary to and involved\nan unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s ineffective-\nassistance-of-counsel cases.\n   AEDPA\u2019s standard is intentionally \u201c \u2018 \u201cdifficult to\nmeet.\u201d \u2019 \u201d White v. Woodall, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 3) (quoting Metrish v. Lancaster, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 5)). We have explained that \u201c \u2018clearly\nestablished Federal law\u2019 for purposes of \u00a72254(d)(1) in\u00ad\ncludes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt\u2019s decisions.\u201d White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAnd an \u2018unrea\u00ad\nsonable application of \u2019 those holdings must be objectively\nunreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not\nsuffice.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3\u20134) (same). To satisfy this\nhigh bar, a habeas petitioner is required to \u201cshow that the\nstate court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal\ncourt was so lacking in justification that there was an\nerror well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. 83, 103 (2011).\n   Adherence to these principles serves important interests\nof federalism and comity. AEDPA\u2019s requirements reflect a\n\u201cpresumption that state courts know and follow the law.\u201d\nWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002) ( per curiam).\nWhen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nreview, federal judges are required to afford state courts\ndue respect by overturning their decisions only when there\ncould be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\nFederal habeas review thus exists as \u201ca guard against\nextreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice sys\u00ad\ntems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction\nthrough appeal.\u201d Harrington, supra, at 102\u2013103 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This is especially true for\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where AEDPA\nreview must be \u201c \u2018 \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d \u2019 \u201d in order to afford\n\u201cboth the state court and the defense attorney the benefit\nof the doubt.\u201d Burt v. Titlow, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 1) (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. 170,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 17)).\n                              B\n   The Sixth Circuit should not have affirmed the Cronic\u00ad\nbased grant of habeas relief in this case. The Michigan\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision was not contrary to any clearly\nestablished holding of this Court. We have never ad\u00ad\ndressed whether the rule announced in Cronic applies to\ntestimony regarding codefendants\u2019 actions. In Cronic\nitself, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s\nlack of experience and short time for preparation warranted\na presumption of prejudice, not a claim based on coun-\nsel\u2019s absence. See 466 U. S., at 663\u2013666. When announc\u00ad\ning the rule in Cronic, we cited earlier cases finding\nprejudice where \u201ccounsel was either totally absent, or\nprevented from assisting the accused during a critical\nstage of the proceeding.\u201d Id., at 659, n. 25. But none of\nthose cases dealt with circumstances like those present\nhere. And Bell did not involve the absence of counsel;\ninstead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital\ndefendant\u2019s counsel \u201cfailed to \u2018mount some case for life\u2019\nafter the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentenc\u00ad\ning hearing and gave a closing statement.\u201d 535 U. S., at\n6                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n696.\n   Because none of our cases confront \u201cthe specific question\npresented by this case,\u201d the state court\u2019s decision could not\nbe \u201ccontrary to\u201d any holding from this Court. Lopez v.\nSmith, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at\n5). The most that the Sixth Circuit could muster was that\n\u201c[t]he testimony of a government witness is similar to the\ntrial events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical\nstages.\u201d 580 Fed. Appx., at 284. But that conclusion is\ndoubly wrong. First, if the circumstances of a case are\nonly \u201csimilar to\u201d our precedents, then the state court\u2019s\ndecision is not \u201ccontrary to\u201d the holdings in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76\u201377, and n. 2\n(2006). Second, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue at too\nhigh a level of generality. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). The relevant testimony was not merely\n\u201ctestimony of a government witness\u201d; it was prosecution\ntestimony about other defendants. To be sure, the Sixth\nCircuit considered the testimony relevant to Donald be\u00ad\ncause he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting\ntheory for felony murder. But Donald\u2019s position was that\nhe had nothing to do with the planning among his code\u00ad\nfendants. And none of our holdings address counsel\u2019s\nabsence during testimony that is irrelevant within the\ndefendant\u2019s own theory of the case.\n   Nor was the state court\u2019s decision an unreasonable\napplication of our cases. The Sixth Circuit stated \u201cthat a\ncritical stage of trial is a \u2018step of a criminal proceeding . . .\nthat h[olds] significant consequences for the accused.\u2019 \u201d\n580 Fed. Appx., at 284 (quoting Bell, supra, at 696). And\nit held that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was\n\u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d because the phone call evidence\nmight have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the\njury. But that holding is not correct. Just last Term we\nwarned the Sixth Circuit that \u201cwhere the \u2018 \u201cprecise con\u00ad\ntours\u201d \u2019 of [a] right remain \u2018 \u201cunclear,\u201d \u2019 state courts enjoy\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n\u2018broad discretion\u2019 in their adjudication of a prisoner\u2019s\nclaims.\u201d White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nLockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003), in turn quot\u00ad\ning Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 998 (1991)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\nWithin the contours of Cronic, a fairminded jurist could\nconclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted\nby counsel\u2019s short absence during testimony about other\ndefendants where that testimony was irrelevant to the\ndefendant\u2019s theory of the case.\n   Cronic applies in \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to\nprejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect\nin a particular case is unjustified.\u201d 466 U. S., at 658. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals\u2019 refusal to apply it to these\ncircumstances was not the \u201cextreme malfunction\u201d required\nfor federal habeas relief. Harrington, 562 U. S., at 102.\n                             III\n   Because we consider this case only in the narrow con\u00ad\ntext of federal habeas review, we \u201cexpres[s] no view on the\nmerits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle.\u201d\nMarshall v. Rodgers, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) ( per curiam)\n(slip op., at 7). All that matters here, and all that should\nhave mattered to the Sixth Circuit, is that we have not\nheld that Cronic applies to the circumstances presented in\nthis case. For that reason, federal habeas relief based\nupon Cronic is unavailable.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n",

S. 685, 696\n(2002), we characterized a \u201ccritical stage\u201d as one that \u201cheld\nsignificant consequences for the accused.\u201d According to\nthe Sixth Circuit, these statements should have compelled\nthe Michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony\nwas a \u201ccritical stage\u201d and that counsel\u2019s absence consti\u00ad\ntuted per se ineffective assistance. Without identifying any\ndecision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth Circuit\nconcluded that the relevant testimony in this case was\n\u201csimilar to\u201d our cases applying Cronic. 580 Fed. Appx., at\n284.\n4                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n                                 II\n\n                                 A\n\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court may\ngrant habeas relief only when a state court\u2019s decision on\nthe merits was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter\u00ad\nmined by\u201d decisions from this Court, or was \u201cbased on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). Donald does not argue that the state-court\ndecision in his case was factually erroneous. Instead, he\nargues that the decision was both contrary to and involved\nan unreasonable application of this Court\u2019s ineffective-\nassistance-of-counsel cases.\n   AEDPA\u2019s standard is intentionally \u201c \u2018 \u201cdifficult to\nmeet.\u201d \u2019 \u201d White v. Woodall, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 3) (quoting Metrish v. Lancaster, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 5)). We have explained that \u201c \u2018clearly\nestablished Federal law\u2019 for purposes of \u00a72254(d)(1) in\u00ad\ncludes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt\u2019s decisions.\u201d White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAnd an \u2018unrea\u00ad\nsonable application of \u2019 those holdings must be objectively\nunreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not\nsuffice.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3\u20134) (same). To satisfy this\nhigh bar, a habeas petitioner is required to \u201cshow that the\nstate court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal\ncourt was so lacking in justification that there was an\nerror well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. 83, 103 (2011).\n   Adherence to these principles serves important interests\nof federalism and comity. AEDPA\u2019s requirements reflect a\n\u201cpresumption that state courts know and follow the law.\u201d\nWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002) ( per curiam).\nWhen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nreview, federal judges are required to afford state courts\ndue respect by overturning their decisions only when there\ncould be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\nFederal habeas review thus exists as \u201ca guard against\nextreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice sys\u00ad\ntems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction\nthrough appeal.\u201d Harrington, supra, at 102\u2013103 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This is especially true for\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where AEDPA\nreview must be \u201c \u2018 \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d \u2019 \u201d in order to afford\n\u201cboth the state court and the defense attorney the benefit\nof the doubt.\u201d Burt v. Titlow, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 1) (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. 170,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 17)).\n                              B\n   The Sixth Circuit should not have affirmed the Cronic\u00ad\nbased grant of habeas relief in this case. The Michigan\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision was not contrary to any clearly\nestablished holding of this Court. We have never ad\u00ad\ndressed whether the rule announced in Cronic applies to\ntestimony regarding codefendants\u2019 actions. In Cronic\nitself, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s\nlack of experience and short time for preparation warranted\na presumption of prejudice, not a claim based on coun-\nsel\u2019s absence. See 466 U. S., at 663\u2013666. When announc\u00ad\ning the rule in Cronic, we cited earlier cases finding\nprejudice where \u201ccounsel was either totally absent, or\nprevented from assisting the accused during a critical\nstage of the proceeding.\u201d Id., at 659, n. 25. But none of\nthose cases dealt with circumstances like those present\nhere. And Bell did not involve the absence of counsel;\ninstead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital\ndefendant\u2019s counsel \u201cfailed to \u2018mount some case for life\u2019\nafter the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentenc\u00ad\ning hearing and gave a closing statement.\u201d 535 U. S., at\n6                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n696.\n   Because none of our cases confront \u201cthe specific question\npresented by this case,\u201d the state court\u2019s decision could not\nbe \u201ccontrary to\u201d any holding from this Court. Lopez v.\nSmith, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at\n5). The most that the Sixth Circuit could muster was that\n\u201c[t]he testimony of a government witness is similar to the\ntrial events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical\nstages.\u201d 580 Fed. Appx., at 284. But that conclusion is\ndoubly wrong. First, if the circumstances of a case are\nonly \u201csimilar to\u201d our precedents, then the state court\u2019s\ndecision is not \u201ccontrary to\u201d the holdings in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76\u201377, and n. 2\n(2006). Second, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue at too\nhigh a level of generality. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). The relevant testimony was not merely\n\u201ctestimony of a government witness\u201d; it was prosecution\ntestimony about other defendants. To be sure, the Sixth\nCircuit considered the testimony relevant to Donald be\u00ad\ncause he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting\ntheory for felony murder. But Donald\u2019s position was that\nhe had nothing to do with the planning among his code\u00ad\nfendants. And none of our holdings address counsel\u2019s\nabsence during testimony that is irrelevant within the\ndefendant\u2019s own theory of the case.\n   Nor was the state court\u2019s decision an unreasonable\napplication of our cases. The Sixth Circuit stated \u201cthat a\ncritical stage of trial is a \u2018step of a criminal proceeding . . .\nthat h[olds] significant consequences for the accused.\u2019 \u201d\n580 Fed. Appx., at 284 (quoting Bell, supra, at 696). And\nit held that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was\n\u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d because the phone call evidence\nmight have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the\njury. But that holding is not correct. Just last Term we\nwarned the Sixth Circuit that \u201cwhere the \u2018 \u201cprecise con\u00ad\ntours\u201d \u2019 of [a] right remain \u2018 \u201cunclear,\u201d \u2019 state courts enjoy\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n\u2018broad discretion\u2019 in their adjudication of a prisoner\u2019s\nclaims.\u201d White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nLockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003), in turn quot\u00ad\ning Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 998 (1991)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\nWithin the contours of Cronic, a fairminded jurist could\nconclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted\nby counsel\u2019s short absence during testimony about other\ndefendants where that testimony was irrelevant to the\ndefendant\u2019s theory of the case.\n   Cronic applies in \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to\nprejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect\nin a particular case is unjustified.\u201d 466 U. S., at 658. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals\u2019 refusal to apply it to these\ncircumstances was not the \u201cextreme malfunction\u201d required\nfor federal habeas relief. Harrington, 562 U. S., at 102.\n                             III\n   Because we consider this case only in the narrow con\u00ad\ntext of federal habeas review, we \u201cexpres[s] no view on the\nmerits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle.\u201d\nMarshall v. Rodgers, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) ( per curiam)\n(slip op., at 7). All that matters here, and all that should\nhave mattered to the Sixth Circuit, is that we have not\nheld that Cronic applies to the circumstances presented in\nthis case. For that reason, federal habeas relief based\nupon Cronic is unavailable.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
