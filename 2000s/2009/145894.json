OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS \n\n                        ET AL. \n\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII\n\n  No. 07–1372. Argued February 25, 2009—Decided March 31, 2009\nAfter the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Congress an\n  nexed the Territory of Hawaii pursuant to the Newlands Resolution,\n  under which Hawaii ceded to the United States the “absolute fee” and\n  ownership of all public, government, and crown lands. In 1959, the\n  Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it “all the public lands\n  . . . held by the United States,” §5(b), and requiring these lands, “to\n  gether with the proceeds from [their] sale . . . , [to] be held by [the]\n  State as a public trust,” §5(f). Hawaii state law also authorizes the\n  State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in\n  trust for Hawaiian citizens. In 1993, Congress’ joint Apology Resolu\n  tion “apologize[d]” for this country’s role in overthrowing the Hawai\n  ian monarchy, §1, and declared that nothing in the resolution was\n  “intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United\n  States,” §3.\n      The “Leiali’i parcel,” a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded\n  to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State\n  since 1959 as part of the Admission Act §5(f) trust. Hawaii’s afford\n  able housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel\n  from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office\n  of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or\n  sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians. After HFDC\n  refused OHA’s demand that the payment include a disclaimer pre\n  serving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the\n  trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or trans\n  fer of the Leiali’i parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final\n  determination of native Hawaiians’ claims. The state trial court en\n  tered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme\n  Court vacated that ruling. Relying on the Apology Resolution, the\n2            HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting\n    petitioners’ argument that the Admission Act and state law give the\n    State explicit power to sell ceded lands.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction. Respondents argue to no avail that\n the case does not raise a federal question because the State Supreme\n Court merely held that the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\n breach of the State’s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians under state\n law. The Court has jurisdiction whenever “a state court decision\n fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven\n with the federal law.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040. Far\n from providing a plain statement that its decision rested on state\n law, the state court plainly held that the decision was dictated by\n federal law, particularly the Apology Resolution. Pp. 6–7.\n    2. The Apology Resolution did not strip Hawaii of its sovereign au\n thority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee\n and granted to the State upon its admission to the Union. Pp. 7–12.\n       (a) Neither of the resolution’s substantive provisions justifies the\n judgment below. The first such provision’s six verbs—i.e., Congress\n “acknowledge[d] the historical significance” of the monarchy’s over\n throw, “recognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation” with\n native Hawaiians, “apologize[d] to [them]” for the overthrow, “ex\n presse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrow’s] ramifi\n cations,” and “urge[d] the President . . . to also acknowledge [those]\n ramifications,” §1—are all conciliatory or precatory. This is not the\n kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, espe\n cially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g.,\n Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17–\n 18. The resolution’s second substantive provision, the §3 disclaimer,\n by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have “claims\n against the United States.” The State Supreme Court, however, read\n §3 as a congressional recognition—and preservation—of claims\n against Hawaii. There is no justification for turning an express dis\n claimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\n tion of claims against another. Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court’s conclusion that the 37 “whereas”\n clauses prefacing the Apology Resolution clearly recognize native\n Hawaiians’ “unrelinquished” claims over the ceded lands is wrong for\n at least three reasons. First, such “whereas” clauses cannot bear the\n weight that the lower court placed on them. See, e.g., District of Co\n lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Second, even if the clauses\n had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii’s rights and\n obligations, as the lower court found. “[R]epeals by implication are\n not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the leg\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  islature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.” National Assn. of Home\n  Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___. The Apology\n  Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest\n  one. Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional\n  concerns if it purported to “cloud” Hawaii’s title to its sovereign lands\n  more than three decades after the State’s admission to the Union,\n  see, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9, the Court re\n  fuses to read the nonsubstantive “whereas” clauses to create such a\n  “cloud” retroactively, see, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381–\n  382.

Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 504–505 (2000). “That\ngovernment sought annexation by the United States,” id.,\nat 505, which the United States granted, see Joint Resolu\ntion to Provide for Annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the\n2          HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States, No. 55, 30 Stat. 750 (hereinafter Newlands\nResolution). Pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the\nRepublic of Hawaii “cede[d] absolutely and without re\nserve to the United States of America all rights of sover\neignty of whatsoever kind” and further “cede[d] and trans\nfer[red] to the United States the absolute fee and\nownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands,\npublic buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and\ndescription belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian\nIslands, together with every right and appurtenance\nthereunto appertaining” (hereinafter ceded lands).1 Ibid.\nThe Newlands Resolution further provided that all “prop\nerty and rights” in the ceded lands “are vested in the\nUnited States of America.” Ibid.\n  Two years later, Congress established a government for\nthe Territory of Hawaii. See Act of Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339,\n31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act). The Organic Act\nreiterated the Newlands Resolution and made clear that\nthe new Territory consisted of the land that the United\nStates acquired in “absolute fee” under that resolution.\nSee §2, ibid. The Organic Act further provided:\n    “[T]he portion of the public domain heretofore known\n    as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on [the\n    effective date of the Newlands Resolution], and prior\n    thereto, the property of the Hawaiian government,\n    and to be free and clear from any trust of or concern\n    ing the same, and from all claim of any nature what\n    soever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof. It\n    shall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be\n    provided by law.” §99, id., at 161; see also §91, id., at\n    159.\n——————\n  1 “Crown lands” were lands formerly held by the Hawaiian monarchy.\n\n“Public” and “Government” lands were other lands held by the Hawai\nian government.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1959, Congress admitted Hawaii to the Union. See\nPub. L. 86–3, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission Act).\nUnder the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant\nhere, “the United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii,\neffective upon its admission into the Union, the United\nStates’ title to all the public lands and other public prop\nerty within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to\nwhich is held by the United States immediately prior to its\nadmission into the Union.” §5(b), id., at 5. These lands,\n“together with the proceeds from the sale or other disposi\ntion of [these] lands and the income therefrom, shall be\nheld by [the] State as a public trust” to promote various\npublic purposes, including supporting public education,\nbettering conditions of Native Hawaiians, developing\nhome ownership, making public improvements, and pro\nviding lands for public use. §5(f), id., at 6. Hawaii state\nlaw also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded\nlands, provided that the proceeds are held in trust for the\nbenefit of the citizens of Hawaii. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n§§171–45, 171–18 (1993).\n   In 1993, Congress enacted a joint resolution “to ac\nknowledge the historic significance of the illegal overthrow\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the\nNative Hawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation\nefforts of the State of Hawaii and the United Church of\nChrist with Native Hawaiians.” Joint Resolution to Ac\nknowledge the 100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893\nOverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L. 103–150,\n107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (hereinafter Apology Resolution). In\na series of the preambular “whereas” clauses, Congress\nmade various observations about Hawaii’s history. For\nexample, the Apology Resolution states that “the indige\nnous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their\nclaims . . . over their national lands to the United States”\nand that “the health and well-being of the Native Hawai\nian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and\n4         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment to the land.” Id., at 1512. In the same vein,\nthe resolution’s only substantive section—entitled “Ac\nknowledgement and Apology”—states that Congress:\n       “(1) . . . acknowledges the historical significance of\n    this event which resulted in the suppression of the in\n    herent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people;\n       “(2) recognizes and commends efforts of reconcilia\n    tion initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United\n    Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians;\n       “(3) apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the\n    people of the United States for the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the par\n    ticipation of agents and citizens of the United States,\n    and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians\n    to self-determination;\n       “(4) expresses its commitment to acknowledge the\n    ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ha\n    waii, in order to provide a proper foundation for rec\n    onciliation between the United States and the Native\n    Hawaiian people; and\n       “(5) urges the President of the United States to also\n    acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation ef\n    forts between the United States and the Native Ha\n    waiian people.” Id., at 1513.\nFinally, §3 of the Apology Resolution states that “Nothing\nin this Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a settle\nment of any claims against the United States.” Id., at\n1514.\n                             B\n  This suit involves a tract of former crown land on Maui,\nnow known as the “Leiali’i parcel,” that was ceded in\n“absolute fee” to the United States at annexation and has\nbeen held by the State since 1959 as part of the trust\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished by §5(f) of the Admission Act. The Housing\nFinance and Development Corporation (HFDC)—Hawaii’s\naffordable housing agency—received approval to remove\nthe Leiali’i parcel from the §5(f) trust and redevelop it. In\norder to transfer the Leiali’i parcel out of the public trust,\nHFDC was required to compensate respondent Office of\nHawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive\nand manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands\nfor the benefit of native Hawaiians. Haw. Const., Art. XII,\n§§4–6.\n    In this case, however, OHA demanded more than mone\ntary compensation. Relying on the Apology Resolution,\nrespondent OHA demanded that HFDC include a dis\nclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to owner\nship of lands transferred from the public trust for redevel\nopment.         HFDC declined to include the requested\ndisclaimer because “to do so would place a cloud on title,\nrendering title insurance unavailable.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 207a.\n    Again relying on the Apology Resolution, respondents\nthen sued the State, its Governor, HFDC (since renamed),\nand its officials. Respondents sought “to enjoin the defen\ndants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali’i\nparcel to third parties and selling or otherwise transfer\nring to third parties any of the ceded lands in general until\na determination of the native Hawaiians’ claims to the\nceded lands is made.” Office of Hawaiian Affairs v.

Respondents\n“alleged that an injunction was proper because, in light of\nthe Apology Resolution, any transfer of ceded lands by the\nState to third-parties would amount to a breach of trust\n. . . .” Id., at 188, 177 P. 3d, at 898.\n    The state trial court entered judgment against respon\ndents, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the lower\ncourt’s ruling. Relying on a “plain reading of the Apology\n6         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nResolution,” which “dictate[d]” its conclusion, id., at 212,\n177 P. 3d, at 988, the State Supreme Court ordered “an\ninjunction against the defendants from selling or other\nwise transferring to third parties (1) the Leiali’i parcel and\n(2) any other ceded lands from the public lands trust until\nthe claims of the native Hawaiians to the ceded lands have\nbeen resolved,” id., at 218, 177 P. 3d, at 928. In doing so,\nthe court rejected petitioners’ argument that “the State\nhas the undoubted and explicit power to sell ceded lands\npursuant to the terms of the Admission Act and pursuant\nto state law.” Id., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 920 (internal quo\ntation marks and alterations omitted). We granted certio\nrari. 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                               II\n   Before turning to the merits, we first must address our\njurisdiction. According to respondents, the Supreme Court\nof Hawaii “merely held that, in light of the ongoing recon\nciliation process, the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\nbreach of the State’s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians\nunder state law.” Brief for Respondents 17. Because\nrespondents believe that this case does not raise a federal\nquestion, they urge us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Although respondents dwell at length on that argument,\nsee id., at 19–34, we need not tarry long to reject it. This\nCourt has jurisdiction whenever “a state court decision\nfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be\ninterwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not\nclear from the face of the opinion.” Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040–1041 (1983). Far from providing a “plain\nstatement” that its decision rested on state law, id., at\n1041, the State Supreme Court plainly held that its deci\nsion was “dictate[d]” by federal law—in particular, the\nApology Resolution, see 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at\n922. Indeed, the court explained that the Apology Resolu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion lies “[a]t the heart of [respondents’] claims,” that\nrespondents’ “current claim for injunctive relief is . . .\nbased largely upon the Apology Resolution,” and that\nrespondents’ arguments presuppose that the Apology\nResolution “changed the legal landscape and restructured\nthe rights and obligations of the State.” Id., at 189–190,\n177 P. 3d, at 899–900 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court noted that “[t]he primary question before this\ncourt on appeal is whether, in light of the Apology Resolu\ntion, this court should issue an injunction” against sale of\nthe trust lands, id., at 210, 177 P. 3d, at 920, and it con\ncluded, “[b]ased on a plain reading” of the Apology Resolu\ntion, that “Congress has clearly recognized that the native\nHawaiian people have unrelinquished claims over the\nceded lands,” id., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901.\n   Based on these and the remainder of the State Supreme\nCourt’s 77 references to the Apology Resolution, we have\nno doubt that the decision below rested on federal law.2\nWe are therefore satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction.\nSee 28 U. S. C. §1257.\n                              III\n   Turning to the merits, we must decide whether the\nApology Resolution “strips Hawaii of its sovereign author\nity to sell, exchange, or transfer” (Pet. for Cert. i) the lands\n——————\n  2 Respondents argue that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied on the\n\nApology Resolution “simply to support its factual determination that\nNative Hawaiians have unresolved claims to the ceded lands.” Brief for\nRespondents 21. Regardless of its factual determinations, however, the\nlower court’s legal conclusions were, at the very least, “interwoven with\nthe federal law.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983).

Housing and Community Development\nCorp. of Hawaii, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Haw.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217, 218, 177 P. 3d 884, 927, 928 (2008)\n(“hold[ing]” that respondents’ legal claim “arose” only when “the Apol\nogy Resolution was signed into law on November 23, 1993”); id., at 211,\nn. 25, 177 P. 3d, at 921, n. 25 (emphasizing that “our holding is\ngrounded in Hawai‘i and federal law”). See also n. 4, infra.\n8           HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the United States held in “absolute fee” (30 Stat. 750)\nand “grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii, effective upon its\nadmission into the Union” (73 Stat. 5). We conclude that\nthe Apology Resolution has no such effect.\n                            A\n   “We begin, as always, with the text of the statute.”\nPermanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of\nNew York, 551 U. S. 193, 197 (2007). The Apology Resolu\ntion contains two substantive provisions. See 107 Stat.\n1513–1514. Neither justifies the judgment below.\n   The resolution’s first substantive provision uses six\nverbs, all of which are conciliatory or precatory. Specifi\ncally, Congress “acknowledge[d] the historical signifi\ncance” of the Hawaiian monarchy’s overthrow, “recog\nnize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation” with\nnative Hawaiians, “apologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians” for\nthe monarchy’s overthrow, “expresse[d] [Congress’s] com\nmitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the over\nthrow,” and “urge[d] the President of the United States to\nalso acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow . . . .”\n§1. Such terms are not the kind that Congress uses to\ncreate substantive rights—especially those that are en\nforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g., Penn\nhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S.\n1, 17–18 (1981).3\n——————\n    3 TheApology Resolution’s operative provisions thus stand in sharp\ncontrast with those of other “apologies,” which Congress intended to\nhave substantive effect. See, e.g., Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat.\n903, 50 U. S. C. App. §1989 (2000 ed.)

By its terms,\n§3 speaks only to those who may or may not have “claims\nagainst the United States.” The court below, however,\nheld that the only way to save §3 from superfluity is to\nconstrue it as a congressional recognition—and preserva\ntion—of claims against Hawaii and as “the foundation (or\nstarting point) for reconciliation” between the State and\nnative Hawaiians. 117 Haw., at 192, 177 P. 3d, at 902.\n   “We must have regard to all the words used by Con\ngress, and as far as possible give effect to them,” Louisville\n& Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911),\nbut that maxim is not a judicial license to turn an irrele\nvant statutory provision into a relevant one. And we know\nof no justification for turning an express disclaimer of\nclaims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\ntion of claims against another.4 Cf. Pacific Bell Telephone\nCo. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n——————\n  4 The  court below held that respondents “prevailed on the merits” by\nshowing that “Congress has clearly recognized that the native Hawai\nian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which\nwere taken without consent or compensation and which the native\nHawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to\nfuture generations.” 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at 922. And it\nfurther held that petitioners failed to show that the State has the\n“power to sell ceded lands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act.”\nId., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 921 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Respondents now insist, however, that their claims are\n“nonjusticiable” to the extent that they are grounded on “broader moral\nand political” bases. Brief for Respondents 18. No matter how respon\ndents characterize their claims, it is undeniable that they have asserted\ntitle to the ceded lands throughout this litigation, see id., at 40, n. 15\n(conceding the point), and it is undeniable that the Supreme Court of\nHawaii relied on those claims in issuing an injunction, which is a legal\n(and hence justiciable) remedy—not a moral, political, or nonjusticiable\none.\n10         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(2009) (slip op., at 17) (“Two wrong claims do not make one\nthat is right”). The Supreme Court of Hawaii erred in\nreading §3 as recognizing claims inconsistent with the title\nheld in “absolute fee” by the United States (30 Stat. 750)\nand conveyed to the State of Hawaii at statehood. See\nsupra, at 2–3.\n                                 B\n  Rather than focusing on the operative words of the law,\nthe court below directed its attention to the 37 “whereas”\nclauses that preface the Apology Resolution. See 107 Stat.\n1510–1513. “Based on a plain reading of” the “whereas”\nclauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that “Congress\nhas clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people\nhave unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.” 117\nHaw., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901. That conclusion is wrong\nfor at least three reasons.\n  First, “whereas” clauses like those in the Apology Reso\nlution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed\non them. As we recently explained in a different context,\n“where the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not\nhave operative effect, such as ‘whereas’ clauses in federal\nlegislation . . . , a court has no license to make it do what it\nwas not designed to do.” District of Columbia v. Heller,\n554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2008) (slip op., at 4, n. 3). See also\nYazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, 132 U. S.\n174, 188 (1889) (“[A]s the preamble is no part of the act,\nand cannot enlarge or confer powers, nor control the words\nof the act, unless they are doubtful or ambiguous, the\nnecessity of resorting to it to assist in ascertaining the\ntrue intent and meaning of the legislature is in itself fatal\nto the claim set up”).\n  Second, even if the “whereas” clauses had some legal\neffect, they did not “chang[e] the legal landscape and\nrestructur[e] the rights and obligations of the State.” 117\nHaw., at 190, 177 P. 3d, at 900.

S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“repeals by implication are not favored and will not be\npresumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal\n[is] clear and manifest.” National Assn. of Home Builders\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 662 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Apology Resolution reveals\nno indication—much less a “clear and manifest” one—that\nCongress intended to amend or repeal the State’s rights\nand obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal\nlaw); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to “cloud” the title that\nthe United States held in “absolute fee” and transferred to\nthe State in 1959. On that score, we find it telling that\neven respondent OHA has now abandoned its argument,\nmade below, that “Congress . . . enacted the Apology Reso\nlution and thus . . . change[d]” the Admission Act. App.\n114a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 37–38.\n   Third, the Apology Resolution would raise grave consti\ntutional concerns if it purported to “cloud” Hawaii’s title to\nits sovereign lands more than three decades after the\nState’s admission to the Union. We have emphasized that\n“Congress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey sub\nmerged lands that have already been bestowed upon a\nState.” Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9\n(2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted);\nsee also id., at 284 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (“[T]he\nconsequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ig\nnores the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to\nsuggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish\nwhat has already been bestowed”). And that proposition\napplies a fortiori where virtually all of the State’s public\nlands—not just its submerged ones—are at stake. In light\nof those concerns, we must not read the Apology Resolu\ntion’s nonsubstantive “whereas” clauses to create a retro\nactive “cloud” on the title that Congress granted to the\nState of Hawaii in 1959. See, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 381–382 (2005) (the canon of constitutional\n12        HAWAII v.

OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS \n\n                        ET AL. \n\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII\n\n  No. 07–1372. Argued February 25, 2009—Decided March 31, 2009\nAfter the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Congress an\n  nexed the Territory of Hawaii pursuant to the Newlands Resolution,\n  under which Hawaii ceded to the United States the “absolute fee” and\n  ownership of all public, government, and crown lands. In 1959, the\n  Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it “all the public lands\n  . . . held by the United States,” §5(b), and requiring these lands, “to\n  gether with the proceeds from [their] sale . . . , [to] be held by [the]\n  State as a public trust,” §5(f). Hawaii state law also authorizes the\n  State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in\n  trust for Hawaiian citizens. In 1993, Congress’ joint Apology Resolu\n  tion “apologize[d]” for this country’s role in overthrowing the Hawai\n  ian monarchy, §1, and declared that nothing in the resolution was\n  “intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United\n  States,” §3.\n      The “Leiali’i parcel,” a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded\n  to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State\n  since 1959 as part of the Admission Act §5(f) trust. Hawaii’s afford\n  able housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel\n  from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office\n  of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or\n  sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians. After HFDC\n  refused OHA’s demand that the payment include a disclaimer pre\n  serving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the\n  trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or trans\n  fer of the Leiali’i parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final\n  determination of native Hawaiians’ claims. The state trial court en\n  tered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme\n  Court vacated that ruling. Relying on the Apology Resolution, the\n2            HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting\n    petitioners’ argument that the Admission Act and state law give the\n    State explicit power to sell ceded lands.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction. Respondents argue to no avail that\n the case does not raise a federal question because the State Supreme\n Court merely held that the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\n breach of the State’s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians under state\n law. The Court has jurisdiction whenever “a state court decision\n fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven\n with the federal law.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040. Far\n from providing a plain statement that its decision rested on state\n law, the state court plainly held that the decision was dictated by\n federal law, particularly the Apology Resolution. Pp. 6–7.\n    2. The Apology Resolution did not strip Hawaii of its sovereign au\n thority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee\n and granted to the State upon its admission to the Union. Pp. 7–12.\n       (a) Neither of the resolution’s substantive provisions justifies the\n judgment below. The first such provision’s six verbs—i.e., Congress\n “acknowledge[d] the historical significance” of the monarchy’s over\n throw, “recognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation” with\n native Hawaiians, “apologize[d] to [them]” for the overthrow, “ex\n presse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrow’s] ramifi\n cations,” and “urge[d] the President . . . to also acknowledge [those]\n ramifications,” §1—are all conciliatory or precatory. This is not the\n kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, espe\n cially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g.,\n Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17–\n 18. The resolution’s second substantive provision, the §3 disclaimer,\n by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have “claims\n against the United States.” The State Supreme Court, however, read\n §3 as a congressional recognition—and preservation—of claims\n against Hawaii. There is no justification for turning an express dis\n claimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\n tion of claims against another. Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court’s conclusion that the 37 “whereas”\n clauses prefacing the Apology Resolution clearly recognize native\n Hawaiians’ “unrelinquished” claims over the ceded lands is wrong for\n at least three reasons. First, such “whereas” clauses cannot bear the\n weight that the lower court placed on them. See, e.g., District of Co\n lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Second, even if the clauses\n had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii’s rights and\n obligations, as the lower court found. “[R]epeals by implication are\n not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the leg\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

S. 644, ___. The Apology\n  Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest\n  one. Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional\n  concerns if it purported to “cloud” Hawaii’s title to its sovereign lands\n  more than three decades after the State’s admission to the Union,\n  see, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9, the Court re\n  fuses to read the nonsubstantive “whereas” clauses to create such a\n  “cloud” retroactively, see, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.

Pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the\nRepublic of Hawaii “cede[d] absolutely and without re\nserve to the United States of America all rights of sover\neignty of whatsoever kind” and further “cede[d] and trans\nfer[red] to the United States the absolute fee and\nownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands,\npublic buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and\ndescription belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian\nIslands, together with every right and appurtenance\nthereunto appertaining” (hereinafter ceded lands).1 Ibid.\nThe Newlands Resolution further provided that all “prop\nerty and rights” in the ceded lands “are vested in the\nUnited States of America.” Ibid.\n  Two years later, Congress established a government for\nthe Territory of Hawaii. See Act of Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339,\n31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act). The Organic Act\nreiterated the Newlands Resolution and made clear that\nthe new Territory consisted of the land that the United\nStates acquired in “absolute fee” under that resolution.\nSee §2, ibid.

L. 86–3, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission Act).\nUnder the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant\nhere, “the United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii,\neffective upon its admission into the Union, the United\nStates’ title to all the public lands and other public prop\nerty within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to\nwhich is held by the United States immediately prior to its\nadmission into the Union.” §5(b), id., at 5. These lands,\n“together with the proceeds from the sale or other disposi\ntion of [these] lands and the income therefrom, shall be\nheld by [the] State as a public trust” to promote various\npublic purposes, including supporting public education,\nbettering conditions of Native Hawaiians, developing\nhome ownership, making public improvements, and pro\nviding lands for public use. §5(f), id., at 6. Hawaii state\nlaw also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded\nlands, provided that the proceeds are held in trust for the\nbenefit of the citizens of Hawaii. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n§§171–45, 171–18 (1993).\n   In 1993, Congress enacted a joint resolution “to ac\nknowledge the historic significance of the illegal overthrow\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the\nNative Hawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation\nefforts of the State of Hawaii and the United Church of\nChrist with Native Hawaiians.” Joint Resolution to Ac\nknowledge the 100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893\nOverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L. 103–150,\n107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (hereinafter Apology Resolution). In\na series of the preambular “whereas” clauses, Congress\nmade various observations about Hawaii’s history. For\nexample, the Apology Resolution states that “the indige\nnous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their\nclaims . . . over their national lands to the United States”\nand that “the health and well-being of the Native Hawai\nian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and\n4         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment to the land.” Id., at 1512. In the same vein,\nthe resolution’s only substantive section—entitled “Ac\nknowledgement and Apology”—states that Congress:\n       “(1) . . . acknowledges the historical significance of\n    this event which resulted in the suppression of the in\n    herent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people;\n       “(2) recognizes and commends efforts of reconcilia\n    tion initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United\n    Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians;\n       “(3) apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the\n    people of the United States for the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the par\n    ticipation of agents and citizens of the United States,\n    and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians\n    to self-determination;\n       “(4) expresses its commitment to acknowledge the\n    ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ha\n    waii, in order to provide a proper foundation for rec\n    onciliation between the United States and the Native\n    Hawaiian people; and\n       “(5) urges the President of the United States to also\n    acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation ef\n    forts between the United States and the Native Ha\n    waiian people.” Id., at 1513.\nFinally, §3 of the Apology Resolution states that “Nothing\nin this Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a settle\nment of any claims against the United States.” Id., at\n1514.\n                             B\n  This suit involves a tract of former crown land on Maui,\nnow known as the “Leiali’i parcel,” that was ceded in\n“absolute fee” to the United States at annexation and has\nbeen held by the State since 1959 as part of the trust\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished by §5(f) of the Admission Act. The Housing\nFinance and Development Corporation (HFDC)—Hawaii’s\naffordable housing agency—received approval to remove\nthe Leiali’i parcel from the §5(f) trust and redevelop it. In\norder to transfer the Leiali’i parcel out of the public trust,\nHFDC was required to compensate respondent Office of\nHawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive\nand manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands\nfor the benefit of native Hawaiians. Haw. Const., Art. XII,\n§§4–6.\n    In this case, however, OHA demanded more than mone\ntary compensation. Relying on the Apology Resolution,\nrespondent OHA demanded that HFDC include a dis\nclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to owner\nship of lands transferred from the public trust for redevel\nopment.         HFDC declined to include the requested\ndisclaimer because “to do so would place a cloud on title,\nrendering title insurance unavailable.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 207a.\n    Again relying on the Apology Resolution, respondents\nthen sued the State, its Governor, HFDC (since renamed),\nand its officials. Respondents sought “to enjoin the defen\ndants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali’i\nparcel to third parties and selling or otherwise transfer\nring to third parties any of the ceded lands in general until\na determination of the native Hawaiians’ claims to the\nceded lands is made.” Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Hous\ning and Community Development Corp. of Hawaii, 117\nHaw. 174, 189, 177 P. 3d 884, 899 (2008). Respondents\n“alleged that an injunction was proper because, in light of\nthe Apology Resolution, any transfer of ceded lands by the\nState to third-parties would amount to a breach of trust\n. . . .” Id., at 188, 177 P. 3d, at 898.\n    The state trial court entered judgment against respon\ndents, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the lower\ncourt’s ruling. Relying on a “plain reading of the Apology\n6         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nResolution,” which “dictate[d]” its conclusion, id., at 212,\n177 P. 3d, at 988, the State Supreme Court ordered “an\ninjunction against the defendants from selling or other\nwise transferring to third parties (1) the Leiali’i parcel and\n(2) any other ceded lands from the public lands trust until\nthe claims of the native Hawaiians to the ceded lands have\nbeen resolved,” id., at 218, 177 P. 3d, at 928. In doing so,\nthe court rejected petitioners’ argument that “the State\nhas the undoubted and explicit power to sell ceded lands\npursuant to the terms of the Admission Act and pursuant\nto state law.” Id., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 920 (internal quo\ntation marks and alterations omitted). We granted certio\nrari. 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                               II\n   Before turning to the merits, we first must address our\njurisdiction. According to respondents, the Supreme Court\nof Hawaii “merely held that, in light of the ongoing recon\nciliation process, the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\nbreach of the State’s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians\nunder state law.” Brief for Respondents 17. Because\nrespondents believe that this case does not raise a federal\nquestion, they urge us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Although respondents dwell at length on that argument,\nsee id., at 19–34, we need not tarry long to reject it. This\nCourt has jurisdiction whenever “a state court decision\nfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be\ninterwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not\nclear from the face of the opinion.” Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040–1041 (1983). Far from providing a “plain\nstatement” that its decision rested on state law, id., at\n1041, the State Supreme Court plainly held that its deci\nsion was “dictate[d]” by federal law—in particular, the\nApology Resolution, see 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at\n922. Indeed, the court explained that the Apology Resolu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion lies “[a]t the heart of [respondents’] claims,” that\nrespondents’ “current claim for injunctive relief is . . .\nbased largely upon the Apology Resolution,” and that\nrespondents’ arguments presuppose that the Apology\nResolution “changed the legal landscape and restructured\nthe rights and obligations of the State.” Id., at 189–190,\n177 P. 3d, at 899–900 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court noted that “[t]he primary question before this\ncourt on appeal is whether, in light of the Apology Resolu\ntion, this court should issue an injunction” against sale of\nthe trust lands, id., at 210, 177 P. 3d, at 920, and it con\ncluded, “[b]ased on a plain reading” of the Apology Resolu\ntion, that “Congress has clearly recognized that the native\nHawaiian people have unrelinquished claims over the\nceded lands,” id., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901.\n   Based on these and the remainder of the State Supreme\nCourt’s 77 references to the Apology Resolution, we have\nno doubt that the decision below rested on federal law.2\nWe are therefore satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction.\nSee 28 U. S. C. §1257.\n                              III\n   Turning to the merits, we must decide whether the\nApology Resolution “strips Hawaii of its sovereign author\nity to sell, exchange, or transfer” (Pet. for Cert. i) the lands\n——————\n  2 Respondents argue that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied on the\n\nApology Resolution “simply to support its factual determination that\nNative Hawaiians have unresolved claims to the ceded lands.” Brief for\nRespondents 21. Regardless of its factual determinations, however, the\nlower court’s legal conclusions were, at the very least, “interwoven with\nthe federal law.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983). See\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing and Community Development\nCorp. of Hawaii, 117 Haw. 174, 217, 218, 177 P. 3d 884, 927, 928 (2008)\n(“hold[ing]” that respondents’ legal claim “arose” only when “the Apol\nogy Resolution was signed into law on November 23, 1993”); id., at 211,\nn. 25, 177 P. 3d, at 921, n. 25 (emphasizing that “our holding is\ngrounded in Hawai‘i and federal law”). See also n. 4, infra.\n8           HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the United States held in “absolute fee” (30 Stat. 750)\nand “grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii, effective upon its\nadmission into the Union” (73 Stat. 5). We conclude that\nthe Apology Resolution has no such effect.\n                            A\n   “We begin, as always, with the text of the statute.”\nPermanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of\nNew York, 551 U. S. 193, 197 (2007). The Apology Resolu\ntion contains two substantive provisions. See 107 Stat.\n1513–1514. Neither justifies the judgment below.\n   The resolution’s first substantive provision uses six\nverbs, all of which are conciliatory or precatory. Specifi\ncally, Congress “acknowledge[d] the historical signifi\ncance” of the Hawaiian monarchy’s overthrow, “recog\nnize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation” with\nnative Hawaiians, “apologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians” for\nthe monarchy’s overthrow, “expresse[d] [Congress’s] com\nmitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the over\nthrow,” and “urge[d] the President of the United States to\nalso acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow . . . .”\n§1. Such terms are not the kind that Congress uses to\ncreate substantive rights—especially those that are en\nforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g., Penn\nhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S.\n1, 17–18 (1981).3\n——————\n    3 TheApology Resolution’s operative provisions thus stand in sharp\ncontrast with those of other “apologies,” which Congress intended to\nhave substantive effect. See, e.g., Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat.\n903, 50 U. S. C. App. §1989 (2000 ed.) (acknowledging and apologizing\n“for the evacuation, relocation and internment” of Japanese citizens\nduring World War II and providing $20,000 in restitution to each\neligible individual); Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, 104 Stat.\n920, notes following 42 U. S. C. §2210 (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (“apolo\ngiz[ing] on behalf of the Nation . . . for the hardships” endured by those\nexposed to radiation from above-ground nuclear testing facilities and\nproviding $100,000 in compensation to each eligible individual).\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Apology Resolution’s second and final substantive\nprovision is a disclaimer, which provides: “Nothing in this\nJoint Resolution is intended to serve as a settlement of\nany claims against the United States.” §3. By its terms,\n§3 speaks only to those who may or may not have “claims\nagainst the United States.” The court below, however,\nheld that the only way to save §3 from superfluity is to\nconstrue it as a congressional recognition—and preserva\ntion—of claims against Hawaii and as “the foundation (or\nstarting point) for reconciliation” between the State and\nnative Hawaiians. 117 Haw., at 192, 177 P. 3d, at 902.\n   “We must have regard to all the words used by Con\ngress, and as far as possible give effect to them,” Louisville\n& Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911),\nbut that maxim is not a judicial license to turn an irrele\nvant statutory provision into a relevant one. And we know\nof no justification for turning an express disclaimer of\nclaims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\ntion of claims against another.4 Cf. Pacific Bell Telephone\nCo. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n——————\n  4 The  court below held that respondents “prevailed on the merits” by\nshowing that “Congress has clearly recognized that the native Hawai\nian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which\nwere taken without consent or compensation and which the native\nHawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to\nfuture generations.” 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at 922. And it\nfurther held that petitioners failed to show that the State has the\n“power to sell ceded lands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act.”\nId., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 921 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Respondents now insist, however, that their claims are\n“nonjusticiable” to the extent that they are grounded on “broader moral\nand political” bases. Brief for Respondents 18. No matter how respon\ndents characterize their claims, it is undeniable that they have asserted\ntitle to the ceded lands throughout this litigation, see id., at 40, n. 15\n(conceding the point), and it is undeniable that the Supreme Court of\nHawaii relied on those claims in issuing an injunction, which is a legal\n(and hence justiciable) remedy—not a moral, political, or nonjusticiable\none.\n10         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(2009) (slip op., at 17) (“Two wrong claims do not make one\nthat is right”). The Supreme Court of Hawaii erred in\nreading §3 as recognizing claims inconsistent with the title\nheld in “absolute fee” by the United States (30 Stat. 750)\nand conveyed to the State of Hawaii at statehood. See\nsupra, at 2–3.\n                                 B\n  Rather than focusing on the operative words of the law,\nthe court below directed its attention to the 37 “whereas”\nclauses that preface the Apology Resolution. See 107 Stat.\n1510–1513. “Based on a plain reading of” the “whereas”\nclauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that “Congress\nhas clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people\nhave unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.” 117\nHaw., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901. That conclusion is wrong\nfor at least three reasons.\n  First, “whereas” clauses like those in the Apology Reso\nlution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed\non them. As we recently explained in a different context,\n“where the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not\nhave operative effect, such as ‘whereas’ clauses in federal\nlegislation . . . , a court has no license to make it do what it\nwas not designed to do.” District of Columbia v. Heller,\n554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2008) (slip op., at 4, n. 3). See also\nYazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, 132 U. S.\n174, 188 (1889) (“[A]s the preamble is no part of the act,\nand cannot enlarge or confer powers, nor control the words\nof the act, unless they are doubtful or ambiguous, the\nnecessity of resorting to it to assist in ascertaining the\ntrue intent and meaning of the legislature is in itself fatal\nto the claim set up”).\n  Second, even if the “whereas” clauses had some legal\neffect, they did not “chang[e] the legal landscape and\nrestructur[e] the rights and obligations of the State.” 117\nHaw., at 190, 177 P. 3d, at 900. As we have emphasized,\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“repeals by implication are not favored and will not be\npresumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal\n[is] clear and manifest.” National Assn. of Home Builders\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 662 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Apology Resolution reveals\nno indication—much less a “clear and manifest” one—that\nCongress intended to amend or repeal the State’s rights\nand obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal\nlaw); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to “cloud” the title that\nthe United States held in “absolute fee” and transferred to\nthe State in 1959. On that score, we find it telling that\neven respondent OHA has now abandoned its argument,\nmade below, that “Congress . . . enacted the Apology Reso\nlution and thus . . . change[d]” the Admission Act. App.\n114a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 37–38.\n   Third, the Apology Resolution would raise grave consti\ntutional concerns if it purported to “cloud” Hawaii’s title to\nits sovereign lands more than three decades after the\nState’s admission to the Union. We have emphasized that\n“Congress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey sub\nmerged lands that have already been bestowed upon a\nState.” Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9\n(2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted);\nsee also id., at 284 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (“[T]he\nconsequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ig\nnores the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to\nsuggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish\nwhat has already been bestowed”). And that proposition\napplies a fortiori where virtually all of the State’s public\nlands—not just its submerged ones—are at stake. In light\nof those concerns, we must not read the Apology Resolu\ntion’s nonsubstantive “whereas” clauses to create a retro\nactive “cloud” on the title that Congress granted to the\nState of Hawaii in 1959. See, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 381–382 (2005) (the canon of constitutional\n12        HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\navoidance “is a tool for choosing between competing plau\nsible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the\nreasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the\nalternative which raises serious constitutional doubts”).\n                         *     *    *\n   When a state supreme court incorrectly bases a decision\non federal law, the court’s decision improperly prevents\nthe citizens of the State from addressing the issue in\nquestion through the processes provided by the State’s\nconstitution. Here, the State Supreme Court incorrectly\nheld that Congress, by adopting the Apology Resolution,\ntook away from the citizens of Hawaii the authority to\nresolve an issue that is of great importance to the people of\nthe State. Respondents defend that decision by arguing\nthat they have both state-law property rights in the land\nin question and “broader moral and political claims for\ncompensation for the wrongs of the past.” Brief for Re\nspondents 18. But we have no authority to decide ques\ntions of Hawaiian law or to provide redress for past\nwrongs except as provided for by federal law. The judg\nment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145894/", "sha1": "d9b9ca992b7b2b51395ac148dd2a417beab55275", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-037", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:17"}
