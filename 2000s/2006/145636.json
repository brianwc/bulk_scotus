L. 88-352, \u00a7704, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a). A separate section of the Act\u0097its anti-retaliation provision\u0097forbids an employer from \"discriminat[ing] against\" an employee or job applicant because that individual \"opposed any practice\" made unlawful by Title VII or \"made a charge, testified, as- sisted, or participated in\" a Title VII proceeding or inves- tigation. \u00a72000e-3(a).</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu- sions about the scope of the Act's anti-retaliation provi- sion, particularly the reach of its phrase \"discriminate against.\" Does that provision confine actionable retalia- tion to activity that affects the terms and conditions of employment? And how harmful must the adverse actions be to fall within its scope?</p>\n<p>We conclude that the anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace. We also conclude that the provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant. In the present context that means that the employer's actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a rea- sonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This case arises out of actions that supervisors at peti- tioner Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company took against respondent Sheila White, the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way department at Bur- lington's Tennessee Yard. In June 1997, Burlington's roadmaster, Marvin Brown, interviewed White and ex- pressed interest in her previous experience operating forklifts. Burlington hired White as a \"track laborer,\" a job that involves removing and replacing track compo- nents, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, a co-worker who had previously operated the forklift chose to assume other responsibilities. Brown immediately assigned White to operate the forklift. While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White's primary responsibility.</p>\n<p>In September 1997, White complained to Burlington officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues. After an internal investi- gation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training ses- sion.</p>\n<p>On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner's discipline. At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to per- form only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-worker's complaints that, in fairness, a \" 'more senior man'\" should have the \"less arduous and cleaner job\" of forklift operator. 364 F. 3d 789, 792 (CA6 2004) (case below).</p>\n<p>On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commis- sion). She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner. In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activi- ties. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.</p>\n<p>A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should trans- port White from one location to another. The specific facts of the disagreement are in dispute, but the upshot is that Sharkey told Brown later that afternoon that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance proce- dures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had <i>not</i> been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was suspended. White filed an additional re- taliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed this Title VII action against Burlington in federal court. As relevant here, she claimed that Burlington's actions\u0097 (1) changing her job responsibilities, and (2) suspending her for 37 days without pay\u0097amounted to unlawful re- taliation in violation of Title VII. \u00a72000e-3(a). A jury found in White's favor on both of these claims. It awarded her $43,500 in compensatory damages, including $3,250 in medical expenses. The District Court denied Burlington's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b).</p>\n<p>Initially, a divided Sixth Circuit panel reversed the judgment and found in Burlington's favor on the retalia- tion claims. 310 F. 3d 443 (2002). The full Court of Ap- peals vacated the panel's decision, however, and heard the matter en banc. The court then affirmed the District Court's judgment in White's favor on both retaliation claims. While all members of the en banc court voted to uphold the District Court's judgment, they differed as to the proper standard to apply. Compare 364 F. 3d, at 795- 800, with <i>id</i>., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Title VII's anti-retaliation provision forbids employer actions that \"discriminate against\" an employee (or job applicant) because he has \"opposed\" a practice that Title VII forbids or has \"made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\" a Title VII \"investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\" \u00a72000e-3(a). No one doubts that the term \"discriminate against\" refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals. See <i>Jack-</i> <i>son</i> v. <i>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,</i> 544 U. S. 167, 174 (2005); <i>Price Waterhouse</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> 490 U. S. 228, 244 (1989) (plurality opinion); see also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 758 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 3b). But different Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.</p>\n<p>Some Circuits have insisted upon a close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment. The Sixth Circuit majority in this case, for example, said that a plaintiff must show an \"adverse employment action,\" which it defined as a \"materially adverse change in the terms and conditions\" of employment. 364 F. 3d, at 795 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit has thus joined those Courts of Appeals that apply the same standard for retaliation that they apply to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that the challenged action must \"resul[t] in an adverse effect on the 'terms, condi- tions, or benefits' of employment.\" <i>Von Gunten</i> v. <i>Mary-</i> <i>land</i>, 243 F. 3d 858, 866 (CA4 2001); see <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Pittsburgh</i>, 120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have adopted a more restrictive approach. They employ an \"ultimate employment deci- sio[n]\" standard, which limits actionable retaliatory con- duct to acts \" 'such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.'\" <i>Mattern</i> v. <i>Eastman</i> <i>Kodak Co</i>., 104 F. 3d 702, 707 (CA5 1997); see <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i>, 127 F. 3d 686, 692 (CA8 1997).</p>\n<p>Other Circuits have not so limited the scope of the pro- vision. The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits have said that the plaintiff must show that the \"em- ployer's challenged action would have been material to a reasonable employee,\" which in contexts like the present one means that it would likely have \"dissuaded a reason- able worker from making or supporting a charge of dis- crimination.\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Illinois Dept. of Revenue</i>, 420 F. 3d 658, 662 (CA7 2005); see <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1217-1218 (CADC 2006). And the Ninth Circuit, following EEOC guidance, has said that the plain- tiff must simply establish \" 'adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in pro- tected activity.'\" <i>Ray</i> v. <i>Henderson</i>, 217 F. 3d 1234, 1242- 1243 (CA9 2000). The concurring judges below would have applied this last mentioned standard. 364 F. 3d, at 809 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement. To do so requires us to decide whether Title VII's anti- retaliation provision forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace. And we must characterize how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision's scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner and the Solicitor General both argue that the Sixth Circuit is correct to require a link between the chal- lenged retaliatory action and the terms, conditions, or status of employment. They note that Title VII's substan- tive anti-discrimination provision protects an individual only from employment-related discrimination. They add that the anti-retaliation provision should be read <i>in pari</i> <i>materia</i> with the anti-discrimination provision. And they conclude that the employer actions prohibited by the anti- retaliation provision should similarly be limited to conduct that \"affects the employee's 'compensation, terms, condi- tions, or privileges of employment.'\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13 (quoting \u00a72000e-2(a)(1)); see Brief for Petitioner 13 (same).</p>\n<p>We cannot agree. The language of the substantive provision differs from that of the anti-retaliation provision in important ways. Section 703(a) sets forth Title VII's core anti-discrimination provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) <i>to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge</i> any indi- vidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any indi- vidual <i>with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-</i> <i>tions, or privileges of employment</i>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national ori- gin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way <i>which would</i> <i>deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-</i> <i>ment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his</i> <i>status as an employee</i>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" \u00a72000e- 2(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII's anti-retaliation provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer <i>to discriminate against</i> any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has op- posed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\" \u00a72000e-3(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The underscored words in the substantive provision\u0097 \"hire,\" \"discharge,\" \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" \"employment opportunities,\" and \"status as an employee\"\u0097explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. No such limiting words appear in the anti-retaliation provision. Given these linguistic differences, the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read <i>in pari materia</i> to mean the same thing. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pasquantino</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States,</i> 544 U. S. 349, 355, n. 2 (2005); <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994); <i>Sullivan</i> v. <i>Everhart,</i> 494 U. S. 83, 92 (1990). Rather, the question is whether Congress in- tended its different words to make a legal difference. We normally presume that, where words differ as they differ here, \"'Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\" <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).</p>\n<p>There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences that its language suggests, for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well. The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status. See <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 411 U. S. 792, 800-801 (1973). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee's efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act's basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <i>i.e.</i>, their status. The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <i>i.e.</i>, their conduct.</p>\n<p>To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other than employment-related dis- crimination. The substantive provision's basic objective of \"equality of employment opportunities\" and the elimina- tion of practices that tend to bring about \"stratified job environments,\" <i>id</i>., at 800, would be achieved were all employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminated.</p>\n<p>But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer actions and harm that concern em- ployment and the workplace. Were all such actions and harms eliminated, the anti-retaliation provision's objective would <i>not</i> be achieved. An employer can effectively retali- ate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <i>outside</i> the workplace. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d, at 1213 (FBI retaliation against employee \"took the form of the FBI's refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death threats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and his wife\"); <i>Berry</i> v. <i>Stevinson Chevrolet</i>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where employer filed false criminal charges against former em- ployee who complained about discrimination). A provision limited to employment-related actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take. Hence, such a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision's \"primary purpose,\" namely, \"[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\" <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U. S. 337, 346 (1997).</p>\n<p>Thus, purpose reinforces what language already indi- cates, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employ- ment. Cf. <i>Wachovia Bank, N. A.</i> v. <i>Schmidt,</i> 546 U. S. ___ (2006) (slip op., at 14) (rejecting statutory construction that would \"trea[t] venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <i>in pari materia</i>\" because doing so would \"overloo[k] the discrete offices of those concepts\").</p>\n<p>Our precedent does not compel a contrary conclusion. Indeed, we have found no case in this Court that offers petitioner or the United States significant support. <i>Bur-</i> <i>lington Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ellerth</i>, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), as petitioner notes, speaks of a Title VII requirement that violations involve \"tangible employment action\" such as \"hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus- ing a significant change in benefits.\" <i>Id</i>., at 761. But <i>Ellerth</i> does so only to \"identify a class of [hostile work environment] cases\" in which an employer should be held vicariously liable (without an affirmative defense) for the acts of supervisors. <i>Id</i>., at 760; see also <i>Pennsylvania</i> <i>State Police</i> v. <i>Suders,</i> 542 U. S. 129, 143 (2004) (explain- ing holdings in <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher</i> v. <i>Boca Raton,</i> 524 U. S. 775 (1998), as dividing hostile work environment claims into two categories, one in which the employer is strictly liable because a tangible employment action is taken and one in which the employer can make an af- firmative defense). <i>Ellerth</i> did not discuss the scope of the general anti-discrimination provision. See 524 U. S., at 761 (using \"concept of a tangible employment action [that] appears in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals\" only \"for resolution of the vicarious liability issue\"). And <i>Ellerth</i> did not mention Title VII's anti-retaliation provi- sion at all. At most, <i>Ellerth</i> sets forth a standard that petitioner and the Solicitor General believe the anti- retaliation provision ought to contain. But it does not compel acceptance of their view.</p>\n<p>Nor can we find significant support for their view in the EEOC's interpretations of the provision. We concede that the EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manu- als that the anti-retaliation provision is limited to \"ad- verse employment-related action.\" 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC 1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual). But in those same manuals the EEOC lists the \"[e]ssential [e]lements\" of a retaliation claim along with language suggesting a broader interpretation. EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (complainant must show \"that (s)he was in some manner subjected to adverse treatment by the respondent because of the protest or opposition\"); EEOC 1988 Manual \u00a7614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (same).</p>\n<p>Moreover, both before and after publication of the 1991 and 1988 manuals, the EEOC similarly expressed a broad interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision. Compare EEOC Interpretive Manual, Reference Manual to Title VII Law for Compliance Personnel \u00a7491.2 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Reference Manual) (\u00a7704(a) \"is intended to provide 'exceptionally broad protection' for protestors of discrimi- natory employment practices\"), with 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a78, p. 8-13 (1998) (hereinafter EEOC 1998 Manual), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/ retal.html (as visited June 20, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (\u00a7704(a) \"prohibit[s] any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity\"). And the EEOC 1998 Manual, which offers the Commission's <i>only</i> direct state- ment on the question of whether the anti-retaliation pro- vision is limited to the same employment-related activity covered by the anti-discrimination provision, answers that question in the negative\u0097directly contrary to petitioner's reading of the Act. <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we do not accept the petitioner's and Solicitor General's view that it is \"anomalous\" to read the statute to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for those whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims of race-based, ethnic-based, religion- based, or gender-based discrimination. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14-15. Congress has provided similar kinds of protection from retaliation in comparable statutes without any judicial suggestion that those provisions are limited to the conduct prohibited by the primary substantive provisions. The National Labor Relations Act, to which this Court has \"drawn analogies . . . in other Title VII contexts,\" <i>Hishon</i> v. <i>King &amp; Spalding,</i> 467 U. S. 69, 76, n. 8 (1984), provides an illustrative example. Compare 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(3) (substantive provision prohibiting employer \"discrimina- tion in regard to . . . any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor or- ganization\") with \u00a7158(a)(4) (retaliation provision making it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this subchapter\"); see also <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc.</i> v. <i>NLRB,</i> 461 U. S. 731, 740 (1983) (construing anti-retaliation provision to \"prohibi[t] a wide variety of employer conduct that is intended to restrain, or that has the likely effect of re- straining, employees in the exercise of protected activi- ties,\" including the retaliatory filing of a lawsuit against an employee); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Scrivener,</i> 405 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1972) (purpose of the anti-retaliation provision is to en- sure that employees are \" 'completely free from coercion against reporting'\" unlawful practices).</p>\n<p>In any event, as we have explained, differences in the purpose of the two provisions remove any perceived \"anomaly,\" for they justify this difference of interpretation. See <i>supra</i>, at 8-9. Title VII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of employees who are willing to file complaints and act as witnesses. \"Plainly, effective en- forcement could thus only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.\" <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.,</i> 361 U. S. 288, 292 (1960). Interpreting the anti-retaliation provision to provide broad protection from retaliation helps assure the cooperation upon which accomplishment of the Act's primary objective depends.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that Title VII's substan- tive provision and its anti-retaliation provision are not coterminous. The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm. We therefore reject the stan- dards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated the anti-retaliation provision as forbidding the same con- duct prohibited by the anti-discrimination provision and that have limited actionable retaliation to so-called \"ulti- mate employment decisions.\" See <i>supra</i>, at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm. As we have explained, the Courts of Ap- peals have used differing language to describe the level of seriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes actionable retaliation. We agree with the formulation set forth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits. In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable em- ployee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, \"which in this context means it well might have 'dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\" <i>Rochon</i>, 438 F. 3d, at 1219 (quoting <i>Washington</i>, 420 F. 3d, at 662).</p>\n<p>We speak of <i>material</i> adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth \"a general civility code for the American workplace.\" <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner</i> <i>Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 80 (1998); see <i>Faragher</i>, 524 U. S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual harassment must \"filter out complaints attacking 'the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the spo- radic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing'\"). An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience. See 1 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimina- tion Law 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that \"courts have held that personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\" and \" 'snubbing' by supervisors and co-workers\" are not actionable under \u00a7704(a)). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with \"unfettered access\" to Title VII's remedial mechanisms. <i>Robinson</i>, 519 U. S., at 346. It does so by prohibiting employer actions that are likely \"to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC,\" the courts, and their employ- ers. <i>Ibid</i>. And normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8-13.</p>\n<p>We refer to reactions of a <i>reasonable</i> employee because we believe that the provision's standard for judging harm must be objective. An objective standard is judicially administrable. It avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff's unusual subjective feelings. We have empha- sized the need for objective standards in other Title VII contexts, and those same concerns animate our decision here. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Suders,</i> 542 U. S., at 141 (constructive discharge doctrine); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>Forklift Systems, Inc.,</i> 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).</p>\n<p>We phrase the standard in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often de- pend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters. \"The real social impact of workplace behavior often de- pends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully cap- tured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\" <i>Oncale</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 81-82. A schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children. Cf., <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Washington, supra,</i> at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child). A su- pervisor's refusal to invite an employee to lunch is nor- mally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight. But to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee's profes- sional advancement might well deter a reasonable em- ployee from complaining about discrimination. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8-14. Hence, a legal standard that speaks in general terms rather than specific prohib- ited acts is preferable, for an \"act that would be immate- rial in some situations is material in others.\" <i>Washington</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 661.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the con- currence, this standard does <i>not</i> require a reviewing court or jury to consider \"the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge.\" <i>Post</i>, at 6 (ALITO, J., con- curring in judgment). Rather, the standard is tied to the challenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that forms the basis of the Title VII complaint. By focusing on the materiality of the challenged action and the perspec- tive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, we believe this standard will screen out trivial conduct while effectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we believe that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury's verdict on White's retaliation claim. See <i>Reeves</i> v. <i>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U. S. 133, 150-151 (2000). The jury found that two of Burling- ton's actions amounted to retaliation: the reassignment of White from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks and the 37-day suspension without pay.</p>\n<p>Burlington does not question the jury's determination that the motivation for these acts was retaliatory. But it does question the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused. The District Court instructed the jury to determine whether respondent \"suffered a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of her employ- ment,\" App. 63, and the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury's finding based on that same stringent interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision (the interpretation that limits \u00a7704 to the same employment-related conduct forbidden by \u00a7703). Our holding today makes clear that the jury was not required to find that the challenged actions were related to the terms or conditions of employment. And insofar as the jury also found that the actions were \"mate- rially adverse,\" its findings are adequately supported.</p>\n<p>First, Burlington argues that a reassignment of duties cannot constitute retaliatory discrimination where, as here, both the former and present duties fall within the same job description. Brief for Petitioner 24-25. We do not see why that is so. Almost every job category involves some responsibilities and duties that are less desirable than others. Common sense suggests that one good way to discourage an employee such as White from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that she spend more time performing the more arduous duties and less time performing those that are easier or more agreeable. That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently found \"[r]etaliatory work assignments\" to be a classic and \"widely recognized\" example of \"forbidden retaliation.\" 2 EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7614.7, pp. 614-31 to 614-32; see also 1972 Reference Manual \u00a7495.2 (noting Commission deci- sion involving an employer's ordering an employee \"to do an unpleasant work assignment in retaliation\" for filing racial discrimination complaint); EEOC Dec. No. 74-77, 1974 WL 3847, *4 (Jan. 18, 1974) (\"Employers have been enjoined\" under Title VII \"from imposing unpleasant work assignments upon an employee for filing charges\").</p>\n<p>To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automati- cally actionable. Whether a particular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and \"should be judged from the perspec- tive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering 'all the circumstances.'\" <i>Oncale</i>, 523 U. S., at 81. But here, the jury had before it considerable evidence that the track labor duties were \"by all accounts more arduous and dirtier\"; that the \"forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige\"; and that \"the forklift operator position was objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented White for occupying it.\" 364 F. 3d, at 803 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of re- sponsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.</p>\n<p>Second, Burlington argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because Burling- ton ultimately reinstated White with backpay. Burlington says that \"it defies reason to believe that Congress would have considered a rescinded investigatory suspension with full back pay\" to be unlawful, particularly because Title VII, throughout much of its history, provided no relief in an equitable action for victims in White's position. Brief for Petitioner 36.</p>\n<p>We do not find Burlington's last mentioned reference to the nature of Title VII's remedies convincing. After all, throughout its history, Title VII has provided for injunc- tions to \"bar like discrimination in the future,\" <i>Albemarle</i> <i>Paper Co.</i> v. <i>Moody,</i> 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted), an important form of relief. Pub. L. 88-352, \u00a7706(g), 78 Stat. 261, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-5(g). And we have no reason to believe that a court could not have issued an injunction where an employer suspended an employee for retaliatory purposes, even if that employer later provided backpay. In any event, Congress amended Title VII in 1991 to permit victims of intentional discrimination to recover compensa- tory (as White received here) and punitive damages, con- cluding that the additional remedies were necessary to \" 'help make victims whole.'\" <i>West</i> v. <i>Gibson,</i> 527 U. S. 212, 219 (1999) (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991)); see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981a(a)(1), (b). We would undermine the significance of that congressional judgment were we to conclude that employers could avoid liability in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Neither do we find convincing any claim of insufficient evidence. White did receive backpay. But White and her family had to live for 37 days without income. They did not know during that time whether or when White could return to work. Many reasonable employees would find a month without a paycheck to be a serious hardship. And White described to the jury the physical and emotional hardship that 37 days of having \"no income, no money\" in fact caused. 1 Tr. 154 (\"That was the worst Christmas I had out of my life. No income, no money, and that made all of us feel bad. . . . I got very depressed\"). Indeed, she obtained medical treatment for her emotional distress. A reasonable employee facing the choice between retaining her job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination com- plaint might well choose the former. That is to say, an indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent, even if the suspended employee eventually received backpay. Cf. <i>Mitchell,</i> 361 U. S., at 292 (\"[I]t needs no argument to show that fear of economic retalia- tion might often operate to induce aggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions\"). Thus, the jury's conclusion that the 37-day suspension without pay was materially adverse was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I concur in the judgment, but I disagree with the major- ity's interpretation of the antiretaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, \u00a7704(a), as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-3(a). The majority's interpretation has no basis in the statutory language and will, I fear, lead to practical problems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Two provisions of Title VII are important here. Section 703(a) prohibits a broad range of discriminatory employ- ment practices.<sup>[1]</sup> Among other things, \u00a7703(a) makes it unlawful for an employer \"<i>to discriminate against</i> any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi- tions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi- vidual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>A complementary and closely related provision, \u00a7704(a), makes it unlawful to \"discriminate against\" an employee for retaliatory purposes. Section 704(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to <i>discriminate against</i> any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has op- posed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-3(a) (em- phasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, we must ascertain the meaning of the term \"discriminate\" in \u00a7704(a). Two possible interpretations are suggested by the language of \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a).</p>\n<p>The first is the interpretation that immediately springs to mind if \u00a7704(a) is read by itself\u0097<i>i.e.</i>, that the term \"discriminate\" in \u00a7704(a) means what the term literally means, to treat differently. Respondent staunchly defends this interpretation, which the majority does not embrace, but this interpretation presents problems that are at least sufficient to raise doubts about its correctness. Respon- dent's interpretation makes \u00a7703(a) narrower in scope than \u00a7704(a) and thus implies that the persons whom Title VII is principally designed to protect\u0097victims of discrimi- nation based on race, color, sex, national origin, or relig- ion\u0097receive less protection than victims of retaliation. In addition, respondent's interpretation \"makes a federal case\" out of any small difference in the way an employee who has engaged in protected conduct is treated. On respondent's view, a retaliation claim must go to the jury if the employee creates a genuine issue on such questions as whether the employee was given any more or less work than others, was subjected to any more or less supervision, or was treated in a somewhat less friendly manner be- cause of his protected activity. There is reason to doubt that Congress meant to burden the federal courts with claims involving relatively trivial differences in treatment. See <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998); <i>Faragher</i> v. <i>Boca Raton,</i> 524 U. S. 775, 786- 788 (1998).</p>\n<p>The other plausible interpretation, and the one I favor, reads \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a) together. Under this reading, \"discriminat[ion]\" under \u00a7704(a) means the discriminatory acts reached by \u00a7703(a)\u0097chiefly, discrimination \"with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privi- leges of employment.\" This is not, admittedly, the most straightforward reading of the bare language of \u00a7704(a), but it is a reasonable reading that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a). It also provides an objective standard that permits insignificant claims to be weeded out at the sum- mary judgment stage, while providing ample protection for employees who are subjected to real retaliation.</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals that have interpreted \u00a7704(a) in this way state that it requires a materially adverse em- ployment action. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Von Gunten</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 243 F. 3d 858, 865 (CA4 2001); <i>Gupta</i> v. <i>Florida Bd. of Re-</i> <i>gents</i>, 212 F. 3d 571, 587 (CA11 2000), cert. denied, 531 U. S. 1076 (2001); <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Pittsburgh</i>, 120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). In <i>Burlington Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ellerth</i>, 524 U. S. 742, 761-762 (1998), we \"import[ed]\" this test for use in a different context\u0097to define the term \"tangible employment action,\" a concept we used to limit an em- ployer's liability for harassment carried out by its supervi- sors. We explained that \"[a] tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\" <i>Id</i>., at 761.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority does not adopt either of the two interpreta- tions noted above. In Part II\u0097A of its opinion, the majority criticizes the interpretation that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a) as not sufficiently faithful to the language of \u00a7704(a). Although we found the materially adverse em- ployment action test worthy of \"import[ation]\" in <i>Ellerth</i>, the majority now argues that this test is too narrow be- cause it permits employers to take retaliatory measures outside the workplace. <i>Ante</i>, at 8-9 (citing <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1213 (CADC 2006); <i>Berry</i> v. <i>Stevinson Chevrolet</i>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996)). But the majority's concern is misplaced.</p>\n<p>First, an employer who wishes to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected conduct is much more likely to do so on the job. There are far more opportunities for retaliation in that setting, and many forms of retalia- tion off the job constitute crimes and are therefore espe- cially risky.</p>\n<p>Second, the materially adverse employment action test is not limited to on-the-job retaliation, as <i>Rochon</i>, one of the cases cited by the majority, illustrates. There, a Fed- eral Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that the Bu- reau had retaliated against him by failing to provide the off-duty security that would otherwise have been fur- nished. See 438 F. 3d, at 1213-1214. But, for an FBI agent whose life may be threatened during off-duty hours, providing security easily qualifies as a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Certainly, if the FBI had a policy of denying protection to agents of a particular race, such discrimination would be actionable under \u00a7703(a).</p>\n<p>But in Part II\u0097B, rather than adopting the more literal interpretation based on the language of \u00a7704(a) alone, the majority instead puts that language aside and adopts a third interpretation\u0097one that has no grounding in the statutory language. According to the majority, \u00a7704(a) does not reach all retaliatory differences in treatment but only those retaliatory acts that \"well might have dis- suaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I see no sound basis for this test. The language of \u00a7704(a), which employs the unadorned term \"discrimi- nate,\" does not support this test. The unstated premise of the majority's reasoning seems to be that \u00a7704(a)'s only purpose is to prevent employers from taking those actions that are likely to stop employees from complaining about discrimination, but this unstated premise is unfounded. While surely <i>one of the purposes</i> of \u00a7704(a) is to prevent employers from engaging in retaliatory measures that dissuade employees from engaging in protected conduct, there is no reason to suppose that this is \u00a7704(a)'s only purpose. Indeed, the majority itself identifies another purpose of the antiretaliation provision: \"to prevent harm to individuals\" who assert their rights. <i>Ante</i>, at 8. Under the majority's test, however, employer conduct that causes harm to an employee is permitted so long as the employer conduct is not so severe as to dissuade a reasonable em- ployee from making or supporting a charge of discrimina- tion.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended.</p>\n<p>First, the majority's test leads logically to perverse results. Under the majority's test, \u00a7704(a) reaches retalia- tion that well might dissuade an employee from making or supporting \"a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). I take it that the phrase \"<i>a</i> charge of discrimination\" means the particular charge that the employee in question filed,<sup>[2]</sup> and if that is the proper interpretation, the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge must be taken into account in applying \u00a7704(a). Specifically, the majority's interpretation logically implies that the degree of protec- tion afforded to a victim of retaliation is inversely propor- tional to the severity of the original act of discrimination that prompted the retaliation. A reasonable employee who is subjected to the most severe discrimination will not easily be dissuaded from filing a charge by the threat of retaliation; the costs of filing the charge, including possi- ble retaliation, will have to be great to outweigh the bene- fits, such as preventing the continuation of the discrimina- tion in the future and obtaining damages and other relief for past discrimination. Because the possibility of rela- tively severe retaliation will not easily dissuade this em- ployee, the employer will be able to engage in relatively severe retaliation without incurring liability under \u00a7704(a). On the other hand, an employee who is subjected to a much milder form of discrimination will be much more easily dissuaded. For this employee, the costs of complain- ing, including possible retaliation, will not have to be great to outweigh the lesser benefits that might be obtained by filing a charge. These topsy-turvy results make no sense.</p>\n<p>Second, the majority's conception of a reasonable worker is unclear. Although the majority first states that its test is whether a \"reasonable worker\" might well be dissuaded, <i>ante</i>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it later suggests that at least some individual characteristics of the actual retaliation victim must be taken into account. The majority comments that \"the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances,\" and provides the following illustration: \"A schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 14.</p>\n<p>This illustration suggests that the majority's test is not whether an act of retaliation well might dissuade the average reasonable worker, putting aside all individual characteristics, but, rather, whether the act well might dissuade a reasonable worker who shares at least some individual characteristics with the actual victim. The majority's illustration introduces three individual charac- teristics: age, gender, and family responsibilities. How many more individual characteristics a court or jury may or must consider is unclear.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority's interpretation contains a loose and unfamiliar causation standard. As noted, the major- ity's test asks whether an employer's retaliatory act \"<i>well</i> <i>might have dissuaded</i> a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Especially in an area of the law in which standards of causation are already complex, the introduction of this new and unclear standard is unwelcome.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority's test but would hold that \u00a7704(a) reaches only those discrimina- tory practices covered by \u00a7703(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Applying this interpretation, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. The actions taken against re- spondent\u0097her assignment to new and substantially less desirable duties and her suspension without pay\u0097fall within the definition of an \"adverse employment action.\"</p>\n<p>With respect to respondent's reassignment, <i>Ellerth</i> specifically identified a \"reassignment with significantly different responsibilities\" as a \"tangible employment action.\" 524 U. S., at 761. Here, as the Court of Appeals stated, \"[i]n essence, . . . the reassignment was a demo- tion.\" 364 F. 3d 789, 803 (CA6 2004). The \"new position was by all accounts more arduous and 'dirtier,'\" <i>ibid</i>., and petitioner's sole stated rationale for the reassignment was that respondent's prior duties were better suited for some- one with greater seniority. This was virtually an admis- sion that respondent was demoted when those responsi- bilities were taken away from her.</p>\n<p>I would hold that respondent's suspension without pay likewise satisfied the materially adverse employment action test. Accordingly, although I would hold that a plaintiff asserting a \u00a7704(a) retaliation claim must show the same type of materially adverse employment action that is required for a \u00a7703(a) discrimination claim, I would hold that petitioner met that standard in this case, and I, therefore, concur in the judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 703(a) states in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or <i>other-</i> <i>wise to discriminate against</i> any individual with respect to his compen- sation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p>\"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[2]  The alternative interpretation\u0097that \"a charge\" does not mean the specific charge filed by the employee but an average or generic charge\u0097 would be unworkable. Without gauging the severity of the initial alleged discrimination, a jury cannot possibly compare the costs and benefits of filing a charge and, thus, cannot possibly decide whether the employer's alleged retaliatory conduct is severe enough to dissuade the filing of a charge. A jury will have no way of assessing the severity of the average alleged act of discrimination that leads to the filing of a charge, and, therefore, if \"a charge\" means an average or generic charge, the majority's test will leave juries hopelessly at sea.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 17, 2006\u2014Decided June 22, 2006\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employment discrimina\n  tion based on \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\u201d 42 U.

Respondent White, the only\n  woman in her department, operated the forklift at the Tennessee\n  Yard of petitioner Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. (Bur\n  lington). After she complained, her immediate supervisor was disci\n  plined for sexual harassment, but she was removed from forklift duty\n  to standard track laborer tasks. She filed a complaint with the Equal\n  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that the re\n  assignment was unlawful gender discrimination and retaliation for\n  her complaint. Subsequently, she was suspended without pay for in\n  subordination. Burlington later found that she had not been insub\n  ordinate, reinstated her, and awarded her backpay for the 37 days\n  she was suspended. The suspension led to another EEOC retaliation\n  charge. After exhausting her administrative remedies, White filed an\n  action against Burlington in federal court claiming, as relevant here,\n  that Burlington\u2019s actions in changing her job responsibilities and\n  suspending her for 37 days amounted to unlawful retaliation under\n  Title VII. A jury awarded her compensatory damages. In affirming,\n  the Sixth Circuit applied the same standard for retaliation that it\n  applies to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that a re\n  taliation plaintiff must show an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d de\n  fined as a \u201cmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions\u201d of\n  employment. The Circuits have come to different conclusions about\n2              BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace re\n    lated and about how harmful that action must be to constitute re\n    taliation.\nHeld:\n    1. The anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and\n harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at\n the workplace. The language of the substantive and anti-retaliation\n provisions differ in important ways. The terms \u201chire,\u201d \u201cdischarge,\u201d\n \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\u201d \u201cem\n ployment opportunities,\u201d and \u201cstatus as an employee\u201d explicitly limit\n the substantive provision\u2019s scope to actions that affect employment or\n alter workplace conditions. The anti-retaliation provision has no\n such limiting words. This Court presumes that, where words differ\n as they do here, Congress has acted intentionally and purposely.\n There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differ\n ences here, for the two provisions differ not only in language but also\n in purpose. The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace\n where individuals are not discriminated against because of their\n status, while the anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent an em\n ployer from interfering with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or ad\n vance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees. To secure the first\n objective, Congress needed only to prohibit employment-related dis\n crimination. But this would not achieve the second objective because\n it would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take,\n therefore failing to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision\u2019s pur\n pose of \u201c[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial\n mechanisms,\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 346. Thus,\n purpose reinforces what the language says, namely, that the anti-\n retaliation provision is not limited to actions affecting employment\n terms and conditions. Neither this Court\u2019s precedent nor the EEOC\u2019s\n interpretations support a contrary conclusion. Nor is it anomalous to\n read the statute to provide broader protection for retaliation victims\n than for victims of discrimination. Congress has provided similar\n protection from retaliation in comparable statutes. And differences\n in the purpose of the two Title VII provisions remove any perceived\n \u201canomaly,\u201d for they justify this difference in interpretation. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    2. The anti-retaliation provision covers only those employer actions\n that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or\n applicant. This Court agrees with the Seventh and District of Co\n lumbia Circuits that the proper formulation requires a retaliation\n plaintiff to show that the challenged action \u201cwell might have \u2018dis\n suaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\n discrimination.\u2019 \u201d Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1219. The\n Court refers to material adversity to separate significant from trivial\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer in\n  terference with \u201cunfettered access\u201d to Title VII\u2019s remedial mecha\n  nisms by prohibiting employer actions that are likely to deter dis\n  crimination victims from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and\n  employers. Robinson, supra, at 346. The Court refers to a reasonable\n  employee\u2019s reactions because the provision\u2019s standard for judging\n  harm must be objective, and thus judicially administrable. The stan\n  dard is phrased in general terms because the significance of any\n  given act of retaliation may depend upon the particular circum\n  stances. Pp. 12\u201315.\n    3. Applying the standard to the facts of this case, there was a suffi\n  cient evidentiary basis to support the jury\u2019s verdict on White\u2019s re\n  taliation claim. Contrary to Burlington\u2019s claim, a reassignment of\n  duties can constitute retaliatory discrimination where both the for\n  mer and present duties fall within the same job description. Almost\n  every job category involves some duties that are less desirable than\n  others. That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently recog\n  nized retaliatory work assignments as forbidden retaliation. Here,\n  the jury had considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were\n  more arduous and dirtier than the forklift operator position, and that\n  the latter position was considered a better job by male employees who\n  resented White for occupying it. Based on this record, a jury could\n  reasonably conclude that the reassignment would have been materi\n  ally adverse to a reasonable employee. Burlington also argues that\n  the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance be\n  cause White was reinstated with backpay. The significance of the\n  congressional judgment that victims of intentional discrimination can\n  recover compensatory and punitive damages to make them whole\n  would be undermined if employers could avoid liability in these cir\n  cumstances. Any insufficient evidence claim is unconvincing. White\n  received backpay, but many reasonable employees would find a\n  month without pay a serious hardship. White described her physical\n  and emotional hardship to the jury, noting that she obtained medical\n  treatment for emotional distress. An indefinite suspension without\n  pay could well act as a deterrent to the filing of a discrimination\n  complaint, even if the suspended employee eventually receives back-\n  pay. Thus, the jury\u2019s conclusion that the suspension was materially\n  adverse was reasonable.

L. 88\u2013352, \u00a7704, 78 Stat. 257, as amended,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a). A separate section of the Act\u2014its\nanti-retaliation provision\u2014forbids an employer from\n\u201cdiscriminat[ing] against\u201d an employee or job applicant\nbecause that individual \u201copposed any practice\u201d made\nunlawful by Title VII or \u201cmade a charge, testified, as\nsisted, or participated in\u201d a Title VII proceeding or inves\ntigation. \u00a72000e\u20133(a).\n   The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu\nsions about the scope of the Act\u2019s anti-retaliation provi\nsion, particularly the reach of its phrase \u201cdiscriminate\nagainst.\u201d Does that provision confine actionable retalia\ntion to activity that affects the terms and conditions of\nemployment? And how harmful must the adverse actions\nbe to fall within its scope?\n   We conclude that the anti-retaliation provision does not\nconfine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are\n2          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelated to employment or occur at the workplace. We also\nconclude that the provision covers those (and only those)\nemployer actions that would have been materially adverse\nto a reasonable employee or job applicant. In the present\ncontext that means that the employer\u2019s actions must be\nharmful to the point that they could well dissuade a rea\nsonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\ndiscrimination.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   This case arises out of actions that supervisors at peti\ntioner Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Company\ntook against respondent Sheila White, the only woman\nworking in the Maintenance of Way department at Bur\nlington\u2019s Tennessee Yard. In June 1997, Burlington\u2019s\nroadmaster, Marvin Brown, interviewed White and ex\npressed interest in her previous experience operating\nforklifts. Burlington hired White as a \u201ctrack laborer,\u201d a\njob that involves removing and replacing track compo\nnents, transporting track material, cutting brush, and\nclearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way.\nSoon after White arrived on the job, a co-worker who had\npreviously operated the forklift chose to assume other\nresponsibilities. Brown immediately assigned White to\noperate the forklift. While she also performed some of the\nother track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was\nWhite\u2019s primary responsibility.\n   In September 1997, White complained to Burlington\nofficials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had\nrepeatedly told her that women should not be working in\nthe Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said,\nhad also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her\nin front of her male colleagues. After an internal investi\ngation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and\nordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training ses\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion.\n   On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner\u2019s\ndiscipline. At the same time, he told White that he was\nremoving her from forklift duty and assigning her to per\nform only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained\nthat the reassignment reflected co-worker\u2019s complaints\nthat, in fairness, a \u201c \u2018more senior man\u2019 \u201d should have the\n\u201cless arduous and cleaner job\u201d of forklift operator. 364\nF. 3d 789, 792 (CA6 2004) (case below).\n   On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commis\nsion). She claimed that the reassignment of her duties\namounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and\nretaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner.\nIn early December, White filed a second retaliation charge\nwith the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her\nunder surveillance and was monitoring her daily activi\nties. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.\n   A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor,\nPercy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should trans\nport White from one location to another. The specific facts\nof the disagreement are in dispute, but the upshot is that\nSharkey told Brown later that afternoon that White had\nbeen insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White\nwithout pay. White invoked internal grievance proce\ndures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that\nWhite had not been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated\nWhite to her position and awarded her backpay for the 37\ndays she was suspended. White filed an additional re\ntaliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.\n                            B\n  After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed\nthis Title VII action against Burlington in federal court.\nAs relevant here, she claimed that Burlington\u2019s actions\u2014\n(1) changing her job responsibilities, and (2) suspending\n4          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher for 37 days without pay\u2014amounted to unlawful re\ntaliation in violation of Title VII. \u00a72000e\u20133(a). A jury\nfound in White\u2019s favor on both of these claims. It awarded\nher $43,500 in compensatory damages, including $3,250 in\nmedical expenses. The District Court denied Burlington\u2019s\npost-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b).\n   Initially, a divided Sixth Circuit panel reversed the\njudgment and found in Burlington\u2019s favor on the retalia\ntion claims. 310 F. 3d 443 (2002). The full Court of Ap\npeals vacated the panel\u2019s decision, however, and heard the\nmatter en banc. The court then affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment in White\u2019s favor on both retaliation\nclaims. While all members of the en banc court voted to\nuphold the District Court\u2019s judgment, they differed as to\nthe proper standard to apply. Compare 364 F. 3d, at 795\u2013\n800, with id., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring).\n                               II\n  Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision forbids employer\nactions that \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d an employee (or job\napplicant) because he has \u201copposed\u201d a practice that Title\nVII forbids or has \u201cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in\u201d a Title VII \u201cinvestigation, proceeding, or\nhearing.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20133(a). No one doubts that the term\n\u201cdiscriminate against\u201d refers to distinctions or differences\nin treatment that injure protected individuals. See Jack\nson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 174 (2005);\nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 244 (1989)\n(plurality opinion); see also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 758\n(2d ed. 1989) (def. 3b). But different Circuits have come to\ndifferent conclusions about whether the challenged action\nhas to be employment or workplace related and about how\nharmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.\n  Some Circuits have insisted upon a close relationship\nbetween the retaliatory action and employment. The\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuit majority in this case, for example, said that a\nplaintiff must show an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d\nwhich it defined as a \u201cmaterially adverse change in the\nterms and conditions\u201d of employment. 364 F. 3d, at 795\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit has\nthus joined those Courts of Appeals that apply the same\nstandard for retaliation that they apply to a substantive\ndiscrimination offense, holding that the challenged action\nmust \u201cresul[t] in an adverse effect on the \u2018terms, condi\ntions, or benefits\u2019 of employment.\u201d Von Gunten v. Mary\nland, 243 F. 3d 858, 866 (CA4 2001); see Robinson v.\nPittsburgh, 120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). The Fifth\nand the Eighth Circuits have adopted a more restrictive\napproach. They employ an \u201cultimate employment deci\nsio[n]\u201d standard, which limits actionable retaliatory con\nduct to acts \u201c \u2018such as hiring, granting leave, discharging,\npromoting, and compensating.\u2019 \u201d Mattern v. Eastman\nKodak Co., 104 F. 3d 702, 707 (CA5 1997); see Manning v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 127 F. 3d 686, 692 (CA8 1997).\n   Other Circuits have not so limited the scope of the pro\nvision. The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits\nhave said that the plaintiff must show that the \u201cem\nployer\u2019s challenged action would have been material to a\nreasonable employee,\u201d which in contexts like the present\none means that it would likely have \u201cdissuaded a reason\nable worker from making or supporting a charge of dis\ncrimination.\u201d Washington v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 420\nF. 3d 658, 662 (CA7 2005); see Rochon v. Gonzales, 438\nF. 3d 1211, 1217\u20131218 (CADC 2006). And the Ninth\nCircuit, following EEOC guidance, has said that the plain\ntiff must simply establish \u201c \u2018adverse treatment that is\nbased on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to\ndeter the charging party or others from engaging in pro\ntected activity.\u2019 \u201d Ray v. Henderson, 217 F. 3d 1234, 1242\u2013\n1243 (CA9 2000). The concurring judges below would\nhave applied this last mentioned standard. 364 F. 3d, at\n6          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n809 (opinion of Clay, J.).\n  We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement. To\ndo so requires us to decide whether Title VII\u2019s anti-\nretaliation provision forbids only those employer actions\nand resulting harms that are related to employment or the\nworkplace. And we must characterize how harmful an act\nof retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall\nwithin the provision\u2019s scope.\n                              A\n   Petitioner and the Solicitor General both argue that the\nSixth Circuit is correct to require a link between the chal\nlenged retaliatory action and the terms, conditions, or\nstatus of employment. They note that Title VII\u2019s substan\ntive anti-discrimination provision protects an individual\nonly from employment-related discrimination. They add\nthat the anti-retaliation provision should be read in pari\nmateria with the anti-discrimination provision. And they\nconclude that the employer actions prohibited by the anti-\nretaliation provision should similarly be limited to conduct\nthat \u201caffects the employee\u2019s \u2018compensation, terms, condi\ntions, or privileges of employment.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 13 (quoting \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1)); see\nBrief for Petitioner 13 (same).\n   We cannot agree. The language of the substantive\nprovision differs from that of the anti-retaliation provision\nin important ways. Section 703(a) sets forth Title VII\u2019s\ncore anti-discrimination provision in the following terms:\n       \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer\u2014\n       \u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi\n    vidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any indi\n    vidual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi\n    tions, or privileges of employment, because of such\n    individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national ori\n    gin; or\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n      \u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or\n    applicants for employment in any way which would\n    deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ\n    ment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n    status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s\n    race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d \u00a72000e\u2013\n    2(a) (emphasis added).\n  Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation\nprovision in the following terms:\n    \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer to discriminate against any of his employees\n    or applicants for employment . . . because he has op\n    posed any practice made an unlawful employment\n    practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a\n    charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n    manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n    under this subchapter.\u201d        \u00a72000e\u20133(a) (emphasis\n    added).\n   The underscored words in the substantive provision\u2014\n\u201chire,\u201d \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment,\u201d \u201cemployment opportunities,\u201d\nand \u201cstatus as an employee\u201d\u2014explicitly limit the scope of\nthat provision to actions that affect employment or alter\nthe conditions of the workplace. No such limiting words\nappear in the anti-retaliation provision. Given these\nlinguistic differences, the question here is not whether\nidentical or similar words should be read in pari materia\nto mean the same thing. See, e.g., Pasquantino v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 349, 355, n. 2 (2005); McFarland v. Scott,\n512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994); Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83,\n92 (1990). Rather, the question is whether Congress in\ntended its different words to make a legal difference. We\nnormally presume that, where words differ as they differ\nhere, \u201c\u2018Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d Russello v. United States,\n8          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).\n   There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended\nthe differences that its language suggests, for the two\nprovisions differ not only in language but in purpose as\nwell. The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace\nwhere individuals are not discriminated against because\nof their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.\nSee McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792,\n800\u2013801 (1973). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to\nsecure that primary objective by preventing an employer\nfrom interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s\nefforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic\nguarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent\ninjury to individuals based on who they are, i.e., their\nstatus. The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent\nharm to individuals based on what they do, i.e., their\nconduct.\n   To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to\nprohibit anything other than employment-related dis\ncrimination. The substantive provision\u2019s basic objective of\n\u201cequality of employment opportunities\u201d and the elimina\ntion of practices that tend to bring about \u201cstratified job\nenvironments,\u201d id., at 800, would be achieved were\nall employment-related discrimination miraculously\neliminated.\n   But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing\nonly upon employer actions and harm that concern em\nployment and the workplace. Were all such actions and\nharms eliminated, the anti-retaliation provision\u2019s objective\nwould not be achieved. An employer can effectively retali\nate against an employee by taking actions not directly\nrelated to his employment or by causing him harm outside\nthe workplace. See, e.g., Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F. 3d, at\n1213 (FBI retaliation against employee \u201ctook the form of\nthe FBI\u2019s refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death\nthreats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Stevinson Chevrolet, 74 F. 3d 980, 984,\n986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where\nemployer filed false criminal charges against former em\nployee who complained about discrimination). A provision\nlimited to employment-related actions would not deter the\nmany forms that effective retaliation can take. Hence,\nsuch a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the\nanti-retaliation provision\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose,\u201d namely,\n\u201c[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial\nmechanisms.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337,\n346 (1997).\n   Thus, purpose reinforces what language already indi\ncates, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision, unlike\nthe substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory\nactions that affect the terms and conditions of employ\nment. Cf. Wachovia Bank, N. A. v. Schmidt, 546 U. S. ___\n(2006) (slip op., at 14) (rejecting statutory construction\nthat would \u201ctrea[t] venue and subject-matter jurisdiction\nprescriptions as in pari materia\u201d because doing so would\n\u201coverloo[k] the discrete offices of those concepts\u201d).\n   Our precedent does not compel a contrary conclusion.\nIndeed, we have found no case in this Court that offers\npetitioner or the United States significant support. Bur\nlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), as\npetitioner notes, speaks of a Title VII requirement that\nviolations involve \u201ctangible employment action\u201d such as\n\u201chiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with\nsignificantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus\ning a significant change in benefits.\u201d Id., at 761. But\nEllerth does so only to \u201cidentify a class of [hostile work\nenvironment] cases\u201d in which an employer should be held\nvicariously liable (without an affirmative defense) for the\nacts of supervisors. Id., at 760; see also Pennsylvania\nState Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 143 (2004) (explain\ning holdings in Ellerth and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524\nU. S. 775 (1998), as dividing hostile work environment\n10         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims into two categories, one in which the employer is\nstrictly liable because a tangible employment action is\ntaken and one in which the employer can make an af\nfirmative defense). Ellerth did not discuss the scope of the\ngeneral anti-discrimination provision. See 524 U. S., at\n761 (using \u201cconcept of a tangible employment action [that]\nappears in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals\u201d only\n\u201cfor resolution of the vicarious liability issue\u201d). And\nEllerth did not mention Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provi\nsion at all. At most, Ellerth sets forth a standard that\npetitioner and the Solicitor General believe the anti-\nretaliation provision ought to contain. But it does not\ncompel acceptance of their view.\n   Nor can we find significant support for their view in the\nEEOC\u2019s interpretations of the provision. We concede that\nthe EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manu\nals that the anti-retaliation provision is limited to \u201cad\nverse employment-related action.\u201d 2 EEOC Compliance\nManual \u00a7614.1(d), p. 614\u20135 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC\n1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7614.1(d), p.\n614\u20135 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual). But in\nthose same manuals the EEOC lists the \u201c[e]ssential\n[e]lements\u201d of a retaliation claim along with language\nsuggesting a broader interpretation.

And the EEOC 1998\nManual, which offers the Commission\u2019s only direct state\nment on the question of whether the anti-retaliation pro\nvision is limited to the same employment-related activity\ncovered by the anti-discrimination provision, answers that\nquestion in the negative\u2014directly contrary to petitioner\u2019s\nreading of the Act. Ibid.\n   Finally, we do not accept the petitioner\u2019s and Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s view that it is \u201canomalous\u201d to read the statute to\nprovide broader protection for victims of retaliation than\nfor those whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect,\nnamely, victims of race-based, ethnic-based, religion-\nbased, or gender-based discrimination. Brief for Petitioner\n17; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14\u201315.\nCongress has provided similar kinds of protection from\nretaliation in comparable statutes without any judicial\nsuggestion that those provisions are limited to the conduct\nprohibited by the primary substantive provisions.

Title VII depends for its enforcement\nupon the cooperation of employees who are willing to file\ncomplaints and act as witnesses. \u201cPlainly, effective en\nforcement could thus only be expected if employees felt\nfree to approach officials with their grievances.\u201d Mitchell\nv. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U.

The scope of the anti-retaliation provision\nextends beyond workplace-related or employment-related\nretaliatory acts and harm. We therefore reject the stan\ndards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated\nthe anti-retaliation provision as forbidding the same con\nduct prohibited by the anti-discrimination provision and\nthat have limited actionable retaliation to so-called \u201culti\nmate employment decisions.\u201d See supra, at 5.\n                                B\n     The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

As we have explained, the Courts of Ap\npeals have used differing language to describe the level of\nseriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes\nactionable retaliation. We agree with the formulation set\nforth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits.\nIn our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable em\nployee would have found the challenged action materially\nadverse, \u201cwhich in this context means it well might have\n\u2018dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting\na charge of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d Rochon, 438 F. 3d, at 1219\n(quoting Washington, 420 F. 3d, at 662).\n   We speak of material adversity because we believe it is\nimportant to separate significant from trivial harms. Title\nVII, we have said, does not set forth \u201ca general civility\ncode for the American workplace.\u201d Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 80 (1998); see\nFaragher, 524 U. S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual\nharassment must \u201cfilter out complaints attacking \u2018the\nordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the spo\nradic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and\noccasional teasing\u2019 \u201d). An employee\u2019s decision to report\ndiscriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee\nfrom those petty slights or minor annoyances that often\ntake place at work and that all employees experience. See\n1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimina\ntion Law 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that \u201ccourts have held\nthat personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\u201d\nand \u201c \u2018snubbing\u2019 by supervisors and co-workers\u201d are not\nactionable under \u00a7704(a)). The anti-retaliation provision\nseeks to prevent employer interference with \u201cunfettered\naccess\u201d to Title VII\u2019s remedial mechanisms. Robinson, 519\nU. S., at 346. It does so by prohibiting employer actions\nthat are likely \u201cto deter victims of discrimination from\ncomplaining to the EEOC,\u201d the courts, and their employ\ners. Ibid. And normally petty slights, minor annoyances,\n14         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand simple lack of good manners will not create such\ndeterrence. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8\u201313.\n   We refer to reactions of a reasonable employee because\nwe believe that the provision\u2019s standard for judging harm\nmust be objective. An objective standard is judicially\nadministrable. It avoids the uncertainties and unfair\ndiscrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine\na plaintiff\u2019s unusual subjective feelings. We have empha\nsized the need for objective standards in other Title VII\ncontexts, and those same concerns animate our decision\nhere. See, e.g., Suders, 542 U. S., at 141 (constructive\ndischarge doctrine); Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510\nU. S. 17, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).\n   We phrase the standard in general terms because the\nsignificance of any given act of retaliation will often de\npend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters.\n\u201cThe real social impact of workplace behavior often de\npends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,\nexpectations, and relationships which are not fully cap\ntured by a simple recitation of the words used or the\nphysical acts performed.\u201d Oncale, supra, at 81\u201382. A\nschedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may\nmake little difference to many workers, but may matter\nenormously to a young mother with school age children.\nCf., e.g., Washington, supra, at 662 (finding flex-time\nschedule critical to employee with disabled child). A su\npervisor\u2019s refusal to invite an employee to lunch is nor\nmally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight. But to retaliate\nby excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch\nthat contributes significantly to the employee\u2019s profes\nsional advancement might well deter a reasonable em\nployee from complaining about discrimination. See 2\nEEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8\u201314. Hence, a legal standard\nthat speaks in general terms rather than specific prohib\nited acts is preferable, for an \u201cact that would be immate\nrial in some situations is material in others.\u201d Washington,\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 661.\n   Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the con\ncurrence, this standard does not require a reviewing court\nor jury to consider \u201cthe nature of the discrimination that\nled to the filing of the charge.\u201d Post, at 6 (ALITO, J., con\ncurring in judgment). Rather, the standard is tied to the\nchallenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that\nforms the basis of the Title VII complaint. By focusing on\nthe materiality of the challenged action and the perspec\ntive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position, we\nbelieve this standard will screen out trivial conduct while\neffectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade\nemployees from complaining or assisting in complaints\nabout discrimination.\n                             III\n   Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we\nbelieve that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to\nsupport the jury\u2019s verdict on White\u2019s retaliation claim. See\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S.\n133, 150\u2013151 (2000). The jury found that two of Burling\nton\u2019s actions amounted to retaliation: the reassignment of\nWhite from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks\nand the 37-day suspension without pay.\n   Burlington does not question the jury\u2019s determination\nthat the motivation for these acts was retaliatory. But it\ndoes question the statutory significance of the harm these\nacts caused. The District Court instructed the jury to\ndetermine whether respondent \u201csuffered a materially\nadverse change in the terms or conditions of her employ\nment,\u201d App. 63, and the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury\u2019s\nfinding based on that same stringent interpretation of the\nanti-retaliation provision (the interpretation that limits\n\u00a7704 to the same employment-related conduct forbidden\nby \u00a7703). Our holding today makes clear that the jury was\nnot required to find that the challenged actions were\n16         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelated to the terms or conditions of employment. And\ninsofar as the jury also found that the actions were \u201cmate\nrially adverse,\u201d its findings are adequately supported.\n   First, Burlington argues that a reassignment of duties\ncannot constitute retaliatory discrimination where, as\nhere, both the former and present duties fall within the\nsame job description. Brief for Petitioner 24\u201325. We do\nnot see why that is so. Almost every job category involves\nsome responsibilities and duties that are less desirable\nthan others. Common sense suggests that one good way to\ndiscourage an employee such as White from bringing\ndiscrimination charges would be to insist that she spend\nmore time performing the more arduous duties and less\ntime performing those that are easier or more agreeable.\nThat is presumably why the EEOC has consistently found\n\u201c[r]etaliatory work assignments\u201d to be a classic and\n\u201cwidely recognized\u201d example of \u201cforbidden retaliation.\u201d 2\nEEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7614.7, pp. 614\u201331 to 614\u201332; see also\n1972 Reference Manual \u00a7495.2 (noting Commission deci\nsion involving an employer\u2019s ordering an employee \u201cto do\nan unpleasant work assignment in retaliation\u201d for filing\nracial discrimination complaint); EEOC Dec. No. 74\u201377,\n1974 WL 3847, *4 (Jan. 18, 1974) (\u201cEmployers have been\nenjoined\u201d under Title VII \u201cfrom imposing unpleasant work\nassignments upon an employee for filing charges\u201d).\n   To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automati\ncally actionable. Whether a particular reassignment is\nmaterially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the\nparticular case, and \u201cshould be judged from the perspec\ntive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position,\nconsidering \u2018all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Oncale, 523 U. S., at\n81. But here, the jury had before it considerable evidence\nthat the track labor duties were \u201cby all accounts more\narduous and dirtier\u201d; that the \u201cforklift operator position\nrequired more qualifications, which is an indication of\nprestige\u201d; and that \u201cthe forklift operator position was\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)         17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjectively considered a better job and the male employees\nresented White for occupying it.\u201d 364 F. 3d, at 803 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Based on this record, a jury\ncould reasonably conclude that the reassignment of re\nsponsibilities would have been materially adverse to a\nreasonable employee.\n   Second, Burlington argues that the 37-day suspension\nwithout pay lacked statutory significance because Burling\nton ultimately reinstated White with backpay. Burlington\nsays that \u201cit defies reason to believe that Congress would\nhave considered a rescinded investigatory suspension with\nfull back pay\u201d to be unlawful, particularly because Title\nVII, throughout much of its history, provided no relief in\nan equitable action for victims in White\u2019s position. Brief\nfor Petitioner 36.\n   We do not find Burlington\u2019s last mentioned reference to\nthe nature of Title VII\u2019s remedies convincing. After all,\nthroughout its history, Title VII has provided for injunc\ntions to \u201cbar like discrimination in the future,\u201d Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), an important form of relief.\nPub. L. 88\u2013352, \u00a7706(g), 78 Stat. 261, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(g). And we have no reason to believe\nthat a court could not have issued an injunction where an\nemployer suspended an employee for retaliatory purposes,\neven if that employer later provided backpay. In any\nevent, Congress amended Title VII in 1991 to permit\nvictims of intentional discrimination to recover compensa\ntory (as White received here) and punitive damages, con\ncluding that the additional remedies were necessary to\n\u201c \u2018help make victims whole.\u2019 \u201d West v. Gibson, 527 U. S.\n212, 219 (1999) (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 1, pp.\n64\u201365 (1991)); see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981a(a)(1), (b). We would\nundermine the significance of that congressional judgment\nwere we to conclude that employers could avoid liability in\nthese circumstances.\n18         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Neither do we find convincing any claim of insufficient\nevidence. White did receive backpay. But White and her\nfamily had to live for 37 days without income. They did\nnot know during that time whether or when White could\nreturn to work. Many reasonable employees would find a\nmonth without a paycheck to be a serious hardship. And\nWhite described to the jury the physical and emotional\nhardship that 37 days of having \u201cno income, no money\u201d in\nfact caused. 1 Tr. 154 (\u201cThat was the worst Christmas I\nhad out of my life. No income, no money, and that made\nall of us feel bad. . . . I got very depressed\u201d). Indeed, she\nobtained medical treatment for her emotional distress. A\nreasonable employee facing the choice between retaining\nher job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination com\nplaint might well choose the former. That is to say, an\nindefinite suspension without pay could well act as a\ndeterrent, even if the suspended employee eventually\nreceived backpay. Cf. Mitchell, 361 U. S., at 292 (\u201c[I]t\nneeds no argument to show that fear of economic retalia\ntion might often operate to induce aggrieved employees\nquietly to accept substandard conditions\u201d). Thus, the\njury\u2019s conclusion that the 37-day suspension without pay\nwas materially adverse was a reasonable one.\n                             IV\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a). The majority\u2019s\ninterpretation has no basis in the statutory language and\nwill, I fear, lead to practical problems.\n                             I\n  Two provisions of Title VII are important here. Section\n703(a) prohibits a broad range of discriminatory employ\nment practices.1 Among other things, \u00a7703(a) makes it\nunlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 703(a) states in pertinent part:\n  \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014\n  \u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or other\nwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compen\nsation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\nindividual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n  \u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\nemployment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a) (emphasis\nadded).\n2          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi\nvidual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n   A complementary and closely related provision, \u00a7704(a),\nmakes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d an employee\nfor retaliatory purposes. Section 704(a) states in pertinent\npart:\n      \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer to discriminate against any of his employees\n    or applicants for employment . . . because he has op\n    posed any practice made an unlawful employment\n    practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a\n    charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n    manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n    under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a) (em\n    phasis added).\n  In this case, we must ascertain the meaning of the term\n\u201cdiscriminate\u201d in \u00a7704(a). Two possible interpretations\nare suggested by the language of \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a).\n  The first is the interpretation that immediately springs\nto mind if \u00a7704(a) is read by itself\u2014i.e., that the term\n\u201cdiscriminate\u201d in \u00a7704(a) means what the term literally\nmeans, to treat differently. Respondent staunchly defends\nthis interpretation, which the majority does not embrace,\nbut this interpretation presents problems that are at least\nsufficient to raise doubts about its correctness. Respon\ndent\u2019s interpretation makes \u00a7703(a) narrower in scope\nthan \u00a7704(a) and thus implies that the persons whom Title\nVII is principally designed to protect\u2014victims of discrimi\nnation based on race, color, sex, national origin, or relig\nion\u2014receive less protection than victims of retaliation. In\naddition, respondent\u2019s interpretation \u201cmakes a federal\ncase\u201d out of any small difference in the way an employee\nwho has engaged in protected conduct is treated. On\nrespondent\u2019s view, a retaliation claim must go to the jury\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nif the employee creates a genuine issue on such questions\nas whether the employee was given any more or less work\nthan others, was subjected to any more or less supervision,\nor was treated in a somewhat less friendly manner be\ncause of his protected activity. There is reason to doubt\nthat Congress meant to burden the federal courts with\nclaims involving relatively trivial differences in treatment.\nSee Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S.\n75, 81 (1998); Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 786\u2013\n788 (1998).\n   The other plausible interpretation, and the one I favor,\nreads \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a) together. Under this reading,\n\u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d under \u00a7704(a) means the discriminatory\nacts reached by \u00a7703(a)\u2014chiefly, discrimination \u201cwith\nrespect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privi\nleges of employment.\u201d This is not, admittedly, the most\nstraightforward reading of the bare language of \u00a7704(a),\nbut it is a reasonable reading that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a)\nand 704(a). It also provides an objective standard that\npermits insignificant claims to be weeded out at the sum\nmary judgment stage, while providing ample protection for\nemployees who are subjected to real retaliation.\n   The Courts of Appeals that have interpreted \u00a7704(a) in\nthis way state that it requires a materially adverse em\nployment action. See, e.g., Von Gunten v. Maryland, 243\nF. 3d 858, 865 (CA4 2001); Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Re\ngents, 212 F. 3d 571, 587 (CA11 2000), cert. denied, 531\nU. S. 1076 (2001); Robinson v. Pittsburgh, 120 F. 3d 1286,\n1300 (CA3 1997). In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,\n524 U. S. 742, 761\u2013762 (1998), we \u201cimport[ed]\u201d this test for\nuse in a different context\u2014to define the term \u201ctangible\nemployment action,\u201d a concept we used to limit an em\nployer\u2019s liability for harassment carried out by its supervi\nsors. We explained that \u201c[a] tangible employment action\nconstitutes a significant change in employment status,\nsuch as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment\n4          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwith significantly different responsibilities, or a decision\ncausing a significant change in benefits.\u201d Id., at 761.\n                              II\n   The majority does not adopt either of the two interpreta\ntions noted above. In Part II\u2013A of its opinion, the majority\ncriticizes the interpretation that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and\n704(a) as not sufficiently faithful to the language of\n\u00a7704(a). Although we found the materially adverse em\nployment action test worthy of \u201cimport[ation]\u201d in Ellerth,\nthe majority now argues that this test is too narrow be\ncause it permits employers to take retaliatory measures\noutside the workplace. Ante, at 8\u20139 (citing Rochon v.\nGonzales, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1213 (CADC 2006); Berry v.\nStevinson Chevrolet, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996)).\nBut the majority\u2019s concern is misplaced.\n   First, an employer who wishes to retaliate against an\nemployee for engaging in protected conduct is much more\nlikely to do so on the job. There are far more opportunities\nfor retaliation in that setting, and many forms of retalia\ntion off the job constitute crimes and are therefore espe\ncially risky.\n   Second, the materially adverse employment action test\nis not limited to on-the-job retaliation, as Rochon, one of\nthe cases cited by the majority, illustrates. There, a Fed\neral Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that the Bu\nreau had retaliated against him by failing to provide the\noff-duty security that would otherwise have been fur\nnished. See 438 F. 3d, at 1213\u20131214. But, for an FBI\nagent whose life may be threatened during off-duty hours,\nproviding security easily qualifies as a term, condition, or\nprivilege of employment. Certainly, if the FBI had a policy\nof denying protection to agents of a particular race, such\ndiscrimination would be actionable under \u00a7703(a).\n   But in Part II\u2013B, rather than adopting the more literal\ninterpretation based on the language of \u00a7704(a) alone, the\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           5\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmajority instead puts that language aside and adopts a\nthird interpretation\u2014one that has no grounding in the\nstatutory language. According to the majority, \u00a7704(a)\ndoes not reach all retaliatory differences in treatment but\nonly those retaliatory acts that \u201cwell might have dis\nsuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a\ncharge of discrimination.\u201d Ante, at 13 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   I see no sound basis for this test. The language of\n\u00a7704(a), which employs the unadorned term \u201cdiscrimi\nnate,\u201d does not support this test. The unstated premise of\nthe majority\u2019s reasoning seems to be that \u00a7704(a)\u2019s only\npurpose is to prevent employers from taking those actions\nthat are likely to stop employees from complaining about\ndiscrimination, but this unstated premise is unfounded.\nWhile surely one of the purposes of \u00a7704(a) is to prevent\nemployers from engaging in retaliatory measures that\ndissuade employees from engaging in protected conduct,\nthere is no reason to suppose that this is \u00a7704(a)\u2019s only\npurpose. Indeed, the majority itself identifies another\npurpose of the antiretaliation provision: \u201cto prevent harm\nto individuals\u201d who assert their rights. Ante, at 8. Under\nthe majority\u2019s test, however, employer conduct that causes\nharm to an employee is permitted so long as the employer\nconduct is not so severe as to dissuade a reasonable em\nployee from making or supporting a charge of discrimina\ntion.\n                            III\n   The practical consequences of the test that the majority\nadopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress\nintended.\n   First, the majority\u2019s test leads logically to perverse\nresults. Under the majority\u2019s test, \u00a7704(a) reaches retalia\ntion that well might dissuade an employee from making or\nsupporting \u201ca charge of discrimination.\u201d Ante, at 13 (in\n6             BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nternal quotation marks omitted). I take it that the phrase\n\u201ca charge of discrimination\u201d means the particular charge\nthat the employee in question filed,2 and if that is the\nproper interpretation, the nature of the discrimination\nthat led to the filing of the charge must be taken into\naccount in applying \u00a7704(a). Specifically, the majority\u2019s\ninterpretation logically implies that the degree of protec\ntion afforded to a victim of retaliation is inversely propor\ntional to the severity of the original act of discrimination\nthat prompted the retaliation. A reasonable employee who\nis subjected to the most severe discrimination will not\neasily be dissuaded from filing a charge by the threat of\nretaliation; the costs of filing the charge, including possi\nble retaliation, will have to be great to outweigh the bene\nfits, such as preventing the continuation of the discrimina\ntion in the future and obtaining damages and other relief\nfor past discrimination. Because the possibility of rela\ntively severe retaliation will not easily dissuade this em\nployee, the employer will be able to engage in relatively\nsevere retaliation without incurring liability under\n\u00a7704(a). On the other hand, an employee who is subjected\nto a much milder form of discrimination will be much more\neasily dissuaded. For this employee, the costs of complain\ning, including possible retaliation, will not have to be great\nto outweigh the lesser benefits that might be obtained by\nfiling a charge. These topsy-turvy results make no sense.\n   Second, the majority\u2019s conception of a reasonable worker\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The alternative interpretation\u2014that \u201ca charge\u201d does not mean the\n\nspecific charge filed by the employee but an average or generic charge\u2014\nwould be unworkable. Without gauging the severity of the initial\nalleged discrimination, a jury cannot possibly compare the costs and\nbenefits of filing a charge and, thus, cannot possibly decide whether the\nemployer\u2019s alleged retaliatory conduct is severe enough to dissuade the\nfiling of a charge. A jury will have no way of assessing the severity of\nthe average alleged act of discrimination that leads to the filing of a\ncharge, and, therefore, if \u201ca charge\u201d means an average or generic\ncharge, the majority\u2019s test will leave juries hopelessly at sea.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nis unclear. Although the majority first states that its test\nis whether a \u201creasonable worker\u201d might well be dissuaded,\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it later\nsuggests that at least some individual characteristics of\nthe actual retaliation victim must be taken into account.\nThe majority comments that \u201cthe significance of any given\nact of retaliation will often depend upon the particular\ncircumstances,\u201d and provides the following illustration: \u201cA\nschedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may\nmake little difference to many workers, but may matter\nenormously to a young mother with school age children.\u201d\nAnte, at 14.\n   This illustration suggests that the majority\u2019s test is not\nwhether an act of retaliation well might dissuade the\naverage reasonable worker, putting aside all individual\ncharacteristics, but, rather, whether the act well might\ndissuade a reasonable worker who shares at least some\nindividual characteristics with the actual victim. The\nmajority\u2019s illustration introduces three individual charac\nteristics: age, gender, and family responsibilities. How\nmany more individual characteristics a court or jury may\nor must consider is unclear.\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s interpretation contains a loose\nand unfamiliar causation standard. As noted, the major\nity\u2019s test asks whether an employer\u2019s retaliatory act \u201cwell\nmight have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d Ante, at 13 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Especially\nin an area of the law in which standards of causation are\nalready complex, the introduction of this new and unclear\nstandard is unwelcome.\n   For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority\u2019s test\nbut would hold that \u00a7704(a) reaches only those discrimina\ntory practices covered by \u00a7703(a).\n8          BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. WHITE\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                               IV\n   Applying this interpretation, I would affirm the decision\nof the Court of Appeals. The actions taken against re\nspondent\u2014her assignment to new and substantially less\ndesirable duties and her suspension without pay\u2014fall\nwithin the definition of an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d\n   With respect to respondent\u2019s reassignment, Ellerth\nspecifically identified a \u201creassignment with significantly\ndifferent responsibilities\u201d as a \u201ctangible employment\naction.\u201d 524 U. S., at 761. Here, as the Court of Appeals\nstated, \u201c[i]n essence, . . . the reassignment was a demo\ntion.\u201d 364 F. 3d 789, 803 (CA6 2004). The \u201cnew position\nwas by all accounts more arduous and \u2018dirtier,\u2019 \u201d ibid., and\npetitioner\u2019s sole stated rationale for the reassignment was\nthat respondent\u2019s prior duties were better suited for some\none with greater seniority. This was virtually an admis\nsion that respondent was demoted when those responsi\nbilities were taken away from her.\n   I would hold that respondent\u2019s suspension without pay\nlikewise satisfied the materially adverse employment\naction test. Accordingly, although I would hold that a\nplaintiff asserting a \u00a7704(a) retaliation claim must show\nthe same type of materially adverse employment action\nthat is required for a \u00a7703(a) discrimination claim, I would\nhold that petitioner met that standard in this case, and I,\ntherefore, concur in the judgment.\n",

L. 88-352, \u00a7704, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a). A separate section of the Act\u0097its anti-retaliation provision\u0097forbids an employer from \"discriminat[ing] against\" an employee or job applicant because that individual \"opposed any practice\" made unlawful by Title VII or \"made a charge, testified, as- sisted, or participated in\" a Title VII proceeding or inves- tigation. \u00a72000e-3(a).</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu- sions about the scope of the Act's anti-retaliation provi- sion, particularly the reach of its phrase \"discriminate against.\" Does that provision confine actionable retalia- tion to activity that affects the terms and conditions of employment? And how harmful must the adverse actions be to fall within its scope?</p>\n<p>We conclude that the anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace. We also conclude that the provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant. In the present context that means that the employer's actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a rea- sonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>This case arises out of actions that supervisors at peti- tioner Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company took against respondent Sheila White, the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way department at Bur- lington's Tennessee Yard. In June 1997, Burlington's roadmaster, Marvin Brown, interviewed White and ex- pressed interest in her previous experience operating forklifts. Burlington hired White as a \"track laborer,\" a job that involves removing and replacing track compo- nents, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, a co-worker who had previously operated the forklift chose to assume other responsibilities. Brown immediately assigned White to operate the forklift. While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White's primary responsibility.</p>\n<p>In September 1997, White complained to Burlington officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues. After an internal investi- gation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training ses- sion.</p>\n<p>On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner's discipline. At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to per- form only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-worker's complaints that, in fairness, a \" 'more senior man'\" should have the \"less arduous and cleaner job\" of forklift operator. 364 F. 3d 789, 792 (CA6 2004) (case below).</p>\n<p>On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commis- sion). She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner. In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activi- ties. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.</p>\n<p>A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should trans- port White from one location to another. The specific facts of the disagreement are in dispute, but the upshot is that Sharkey told Brown later that afternoon that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance proce- dures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had <i>not</i> been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was suspended. White filed an additional re- taliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed this Title VII action against Burlington in federal court. As relevant here, she claimed that Burlington's actions\u0097 (1) changing her job responsibilities, and (2) suspending her for 37 days without pay\u0097amounted to unlawful re- taliation in violation of Title VII. \u00a72000e-3(a). A jury found in White's favor on both of these claims. It awarded her $43,500 in compensatory damages, including $3,250 in medical expenses. The District Court denied Burlington's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b).</p>\n<p>Initially, a divided Sixth Circuit panel reversed the judgment and found in Burlington's favor on the retalia- tion claims. 310 F. 3d 443 (2002). The full Court of Ap- peals vacated the panel's decision, however, and heard the matter en banc. The court then affirmed the District Court's judgment in White's favor on both retaliation claims. While all members of the en banc court voted to uphold the District Court's judgment, they differed as to the proper standard to apply. Compare 364 F. 3d, at 795- 800, with <i>id</i>., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Title VII's anti-retaliation provision forbids employer actions that \"discriminate against\" an employee (or job applicant) because he has \"opposed\" a practice that Title VII forbids or has \"made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\" a Title VII \"investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\" \u00a72000e-3(a). No one doubts that the term \"discriminate against\" refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals. See <i>Jack-</i> <i>son</i> v. <i>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,</i> 544 U. S. 167, 174 (2005); <i>Price Waterhouse</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> 490 U. S. 228, 244 (1989) (plurality opinion); see also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 758 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 3b). But different Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.</p>\n<p>Some Circuits have insisted upon a close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment. The Sixth Circuit majority in this case, for example, said that a plaintiff must show an \"adverse employment action,\" which it defined as a \"materially adverse change in the terms and conditions\" of employment. 364 F. 3d, at 795 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit has thus joined those Courts of Appeals that apply the same standard for retaliation that they apply to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that the challenged action must \"resul[t] in an adverse effect on the 'terms, condi- tions, or benefits' of employment.\" <i>Von Gunten</i> v. <i>Mary-</i> <i>land</i>, 243 F. 3d 858, 866 (CA4 2001); see <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Pittsburgh</i>, 120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have adopted a more restrictive approach. They employ an \"ultimate employment deci- sio[n]\" standard, which limits actionable retaliatory con- duct to acts \" 'such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.'\" <i>Mattern</i> v. <i>Eastman</i> <i>Kodak Co</i>., 104 F. 3d 702, 707 (CA5 1997); see <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</i>, 127 F. 3d 686, 692 (CA8 1997).</p>\n<p>Other Circuits have not so limited the scope of the pro- vision. The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits have said that the plaintiff must show that the \"em- ployer's challenged action would have been material to a reasonable employee,\" which in contexts like the present one means that it would likely have \"dissuaded a reason- able worker from making or supporting a charge of dis- crimination.\" <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Illinois Dept. of Revenue</i>, 420 F. 3d 658, 662 (CA7 2005); see <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1217-1218 (CADC 2006). And the Ninth Circuit, following EEOC guidance, has said that the plain- tiff must simply establish \" 'adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in pro- tected activity.'\" <i>Ray</i> v. <i>Henderson</i>, 217 F. 3d 1234, 1242- 1243 (CA9 2000). The concurring judges below would have applied this last mentioned standard. 364 F. 3d, at 809 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement. To do so requires us to decide whether Title VII's anti- retaliation provision forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace. And we must characterize how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision's scope.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner and the Solicitor General both argue that the Sixth Circuit is correct to require a link between the chal- lenged retaliatory action and the terms, conditions, or status of employment. They note that Title VII's substan- tive anti-discrimination provision protects an individual only from employment-related discrimination. They add that the anti-retaliation provision should be read <i>in pari</i> <i>materia</i> with the anti-discrimination provision. And they conclude that the employer actions prohibited by the anti- retaliation provision should similarly be limited to conduct that \"affects the employee's 'compensation, terms, condi- tions, or privileges of employment.'\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13 (quoting \u00a72000e-2(a)(1)); see Brief for Petitioner 13 (same).</p>\n<p>We cannot agree. The language of the substantive provision differs from that of the anti-retaliation provision in important ways. Section 703(a) sets forth Title VII's core anti-discrimination provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) <i>to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge</i> any indi- vidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any indi- vidual <i>with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-</i> <i>tions, or privileges of employment</i>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national ori- gin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way <i>which would</i> <i>deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-</i> <i>ment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his</i> <i>status as an employee</i>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" \u00a72000e- 2(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII's anti-retaliation provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer <i>to discriminate against</i> any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has op- posed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\" \u00a72000e-3(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The underscored words in the substantive provision\u0097 \"hire,\" \"discharge,\" \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" \"employment opportunities,\" and \"status as an employee\"\u0097explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. No such limiting words appear in the anti-retaliation provision. Given these linguistic differences, the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read <i>in pari materia</i> to mean the same thing. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pasquantino</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States,</i> 544 U. S. 349, 355, n. 2 (2005); <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994); <i>Sullivan</i> v. <i>Everhart,</i> 494 U. S. 83, 92 (1990). Rather, the question is whether Congress in- tended its different words to make a legal difference. We normally presume that, where words differ as they differ here, \"'Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\" <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).</p>\n<p>There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences that its language suggests, for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well. The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status. See <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 411 U. S. 792, 800-801 (1973). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee's efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act's basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <i>i.e.</i>, their status. The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <i>i.e.</i>, their conduct.</p>\n<p>To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other than employment-related dis- crimination. The substantive provision's basic objective of \"equality of employment opportunities\" and the elimina- tion of practices that tend to bring about \"stratified job environments,\" <i>id</i>., at 800, would be achieved were all employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminated.</p>\n<p>But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer actions and harm that concern em- ployment and the workplace. Were all such actions and harms eliminated, the anti-retaliation provision's objective would <i>not</i> be achieved. An employer can effectively retali- ate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <i>outside</i> the workplace. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d, at 1213 (FBI retaliation against employee \"took the form of the FBI's refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death threats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and his wife\"); <i>Berry</i> v. <i>Stevinson Chevrolet</i>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where employer filed false criminal charges against former em- ployee who complained about discrimination). A provision limited to employment-related actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take. Hence, such a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provision's \"primary purpose,\" namely, \"[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\" <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U. S. 337, 346 (1997).</p>\n<p>Thus, purpose reinforces what language already indi- cates, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employ- ment. Cf. <i>Wachovia Bank, N. A.</i> v. <i>Schmidt,</i> 546 U. S. ___ (2006) (slip op., at 14) (rejecting statutory construction that would \"trea[t] venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <i>in pari materia</i>\" because doing so would \"overloo[k] the discrete offices of those concepts\").</p>\n<p>Our precedent does not compel a contrary conclusion. Indeed, we have found no case in this Court that offers petitioner or the United States significant support. <i>Bur-</i> <i>lington Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ellerth</i>, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), as petitioner notes, speaks of a Title VII requirement that violations involve \"tangible employment action\" such as \"hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus- ing a significant change in benefits.\" <i>Id</i>., at 761. But <i>Ellerth</i> does so only to \"identify a class of [hostile work environment] cases\" in which an employer should be held vicariously liable (without an affirmative defense) for the acts of supervisors. <i>Id</i>., at 760; see also <i>Pennsylvania</i> <i>State Police</i> v. <i>Suders,</i> 542 U. S. 129, 143 (2004) (explain- ing holdings in <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher</i> v. <i>Boca Raton,</i> 524 U. S. 775 (1998), as dividing hostile work environment claims into two categories, one in which the employer is strictly liable because a tangible employment action is taken and one in which the employer can make an af- firmative defense). <i>Ellerth</i> did not discuss the scope of the general anti-discrimination provision. See 524 U. S., at 761 (using \"concept of a tangible employment action [that] appears in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals\" only \"for resolution of the vicarious liability issue\"). And <i>Ellerth</i> did not mention Title VII's anti-retaliation provi- sion at all. At most, <i>Ellerth</i> sets forth a standard that petitioner and the Solicitor General believe the anti- retaliation provision ought to contain. But it does not compel acceptance of their view.</p>\n<p>Nor can we find significant support for their view in the EEOC's interpretations of the provision. We concede that the EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manu- als that the anti-retaliation provision is limited to \"ad- verse employment-related action.\" 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC 1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual). But in those same manuals the EEOC lists the \"[e]ssential [e]lements\" of a retaliation claim along with language suggesting a broader interpretation. EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (complainant must show \"that (s)he was in some manner subjected to adverse treatment by the respondent because of the protest or opposition\"); EEOC 1988 Manual \u00a7614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (same).</p>\n<p>Moreover, both before and after publication of the 1991 and 1988 manuals, the EEOC similarly expressed a broad interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision. Compare EEOC Interpretive Manual, Reference Manual to Title VII Law for Compliance Personnel \u00a7491.2 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Reference Manual) (\u00a7704(a) \"is intended to provide 'exceptionally broad protection' for protestors of discrimi- natory employment practices\"), with 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a78, p. 8-13 (1998) (hereinafter EEOC 1998 Manual), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/ retal.html (as visited June 20, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (\u00a7704(a) \"prohibit[s] any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity\"). And the EEOC 1998 Manual, which offers the Commission's <i>only</i> direct state- ment on the question of whether the anti-retaliation pro- vision is limited to the same employment-related activity covered by the anti-discrimination provision, answers that question in the negative\u0097directly contrary to petitioner's reading of the Act. <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we do not accept the petitioner's and Solicitor General's view that it is \"anomalous\" to read the statute to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for those whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims of race-based, ethnic-based, religion- based, or gender-based discrimination. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14-15. Congress has provided similar kinds of protection from retaliation in comparable statutes without any judicial suggestion that those provisions are limited to the conduct prohibited by the primary substantive provisions. The National Labor Relations Act, to which this Court has \"drawn analogies . . . in other Title VII contexts,\" <i>Hishon</i> v. <i>King &amp; Spalding,</i> 467 U. S. 69, 76, n. 8 (1984), provides an illustrative example. Compare 29 U. S. C. \u00a7158(a)(3) (substantive provision prohibiting employer \"discrimina- tion in regard to . . . any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor or- ganization\") with \u00a7158(a)(4) (retaliation provision making it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this subchapter\"); see also <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc.</i> v. <i>NLRB,</i> 461 U. S. 731, 740 (1983) (construing anti-retaliation provision to \"prohibi[t] a wide variety of employer conduct that is intended to restrain, or that has the likely effect of re- straining, employees in the exercise of protected activi- ties,\" including the retaliatory filing of a lawsuit against an employee); <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>Scrivener,</i> 405 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1972) (purpose of the anti-retaliation provision is to en- sure that employees are \" 'completely free from coercion against reporting'\" unlawful practices).</p>\n<p>In any event, as we have explained, differences in the purpose of the two provisions remove any perceived \"anomaly,\" for they justify this difference of interpretation. See <i>supra</i>, at 8-9. Title VII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of employees who are willing to file complaints and act as witnesses. \"Plainly, effective en- forcement could thus only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.\" <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc.,</i> 361 U. S. 288, 292 (1960). Interpreting the anti-retaliation provision to provide broad protection from retaliation helps assure the cooperation upon which accomplishment of the Act's primary objective depends.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that Title VII's substan- tive provision and its anti-retaliation provision are not coterminous. The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm. We therefore reject the stan- dards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated the anti-retaliation provision as forbidding the same con- duct prohibited by the anti-discrimination provision and that have limited actionable retaliation to so-called \"ulti- mate employment decisions.\" See <i>supra</i>, at 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm. As we have explained, the Courts of Ap- peals have used differing language to describe the level of seriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes actionable retaliation. We agree with the formulation set forth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits. In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable em- ployee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, \"which in this context means it well might have 'dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\" <i>Rochon</i>, 438 F. 3d, at 1219 (quoting <i>Washington</i>, 420 F. 3d, at 662).</p>\n<p>We speak of <i>material</i> adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth \"a general civility code for the American workplace.\" <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner</i> <i>Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 80 (1998); see <i>Faragher</i>, 524 U. S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual harassment must \"filter out complaints attacking 'the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the spo- radic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing'\"). An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience. See 1 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimina- tion Law 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that \"courts have held that personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\" and \" 'snubbing' by supervisors and co-workers\" are not actionable under \u00a7704(a)). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with \"unfettered access\" to Title VII's remedial mechanisms. <i>Robinson</i>, 519 U. S., at 346. It does so by prohibiting employer actions that are likely \"to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC,\" the courts, and their employ- ers. <i>Ibid</i>. And normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8-13.</p>\n<p>We refer to reactions of a <i>reasonable</i> employee because we believe that the provision's standard for judging harm must be objective. An objective standard is judicially administrable. It avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff's unusual subjective feelings. We have empha- sized the need for objective standards in other Title VII contexts, and those same concerns animate our decision here. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Suders,</i> 542 U. S., at 141 (constructive discharge doctrine); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>Forklift Systems, Inc.,</i> 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).</p>\n<p>We phrase the standard in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often de- pend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters. \"The real social impact of workplace behavior often de- pends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully cap- tured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\" <i>Oncale</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 81-82. A schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children. Cf., <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Washington, supra,</i> at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child). A su- pervisor's refusal to invite an employee to lunch is nor- mally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight. But to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee's profes- sional advancement might well deter a reasonable em- ployee from complaining about discrimination. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a78, p. 8-14. Hence, a legal standard that speaks in general terms rather than specific prohib- ited acts is preferable, for an \"act that would be immate- rial in some situations is material in others.\" <i>Washington</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 661.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the con- currence, this standard does <i>not</i> require a reviewing court or jury to consider \"the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge.\" <i>Post</i>, at 6 (ALITO, J., con- curring in judgment). Rather, the standard is tied to the challenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that forms the basis of the Title VII complaint. By focusing on the materiality of the challenged action and the perspec- tive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, we believe this standard will screen out trivial conduct while effectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we believe that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury's verdict on White's retaliation claim. See <i>Reeves</i> v. <i>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U. S. 133, 150-151 (2000). The jury found that two of Burling- ton's actions amounted to retaliation: the reassignment of White from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks and the 37-day suspension without pay.</p>\n<p>Burlington does not question the jury's determination that the motivation for these acts was retaliatory. But it does question the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused. The District Court instructed the jury to determine whether respondent \"suffered a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of her employ- ment,\" App. 63, and the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury's finding based on that same stringent interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision (the interpretation that limits \u00a7704 to the same employment-related conduct forbidden by \u00a7703). Our holding today makes clear that the jury was not required to find that the challenged actions were related to the terms or conditions of employment. And insofar as the jury also found that the actions were \"mate- rially adverse,\" its findings are adequately supported.</p>\n<p>First, Burlington argues that a reassignment of duties cannot constitute retaliatory discrimination where, as here, both the former and present duties fall within the same job description. Brief for Petitioner 24-25. We do not see why that is so. Almost every job category involves some responsibilities and duties that are less desirable than others. Common sense suggests that one good way to discourage an employee such as White from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that she spend more time performing the more arduous duties and less time performing those that are easier or more agreeable. That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently found \"[r]etaliatory work assignments\" to be a classic and \"widely recognized\" example of \"forbidden retaliation.\" 2 EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7614.7, pp. 614-31 to 614-32; see also 1972 Reference Manual \u00a7495.2 (noting Commission deci- sion involving an employer's ordering an employee \"to do an unpleasant work assignment in retaliation\" for filing racial discrimination complaint); EEOC Dec. No. 74-77, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3847</span></span>, *4 (Jan. 18, 1974) (\"Employers have been enjoined\" under Title VII \"from imposing unpleasant work assignments upon an employee for filing charges\").</p>\n<p>To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automati- cally actionable. Whether a particular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and \"should be judged from the perspec- tive of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering 'all the circumstances.'\" <i>Oncale</i>, 523 U. S., at 81. But here, the jury had before it considerable evidence that the track labor duties were \"by all accounts more arduous and dirtier\"; that the \"forklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige\"; and that \"the forklift operator position was objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented White for occupying it.\" 364 F. 3d, at 803 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of re- sponsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.</p>\n<p>Second, Burlington argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because Burling- ton ultimately reinstated White with backpay. Burlington says that \"it defies reason to believe that Congress would have considered a rescinded investigatory suspension with full back pay\" to be unlawful, particularly because Title VII, throughout much of its history, provided no relief in an equitable action for victims in White's position. Brief for Petitioner 36.</p>\n<p>We do not find Burlington's last mentioned reference to the nature of Title VII's remedies convincing. After all, throughout its history, Title VII has provided for injunc- tions to \"bar like discrimination in the future,\" <i>Albemarle</i> <i>Paper Co.</i> v. <i>Moody,</i> 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted), an important form of relief. Pub. L. 88-352, \u00a7706(g), 78 Stat. 261, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-5(g). And we have no reason to believe that a court could not have issued an injunction where an employer suspended an employee for retaliatory purposes, even if that employer later provided backpay. In any event, Congress amended Title VII in 1991 to permit victims of intentional discrimination to recover compensa- tory (as White received here) and punitive damages, con- cluding that the additional remedies were necessary to \" 'help make victims whole.'\" <i>West</i> v. <i>Gibson,</i> 527 U. S. 212, 219 (1999) (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991)); see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71981a(a)(1), (b). We would undermine the significance of that congressional judgment were we to conclude that employers could avoid liability in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Neither do we find convincing any claim of insufficient evidence. White did receive backpay. But White and her family had to live for 37 days without income. They did not know during that time whether or when White could return to work. Many reasonable employees would find a month without a paycheck to be a serious hardship. And White described to the jury the physical and emotional hardship that 37 days of having \"no income, no money\" in fact caused. 1 Tr. 154 (\"That was the worst Christmas I had out of my life. No income, no money, and that made all of us feel bad. . . . I got very depressed\"). Indeed, she obtained medical treatment for her emotional distress. A reasonable employee facing the choice between retaining her job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination com- plaint might well choose the former. That is to say, an indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent, even if the suspended employee eventually received backpay. Cf. <i>Mitchell,</i> 361 U. S., at 292 (\"[I]t needs no argument to show that fear of economic retalia- tion might often operate to induce aggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions\"). Thus, the jury's conclusion that the 37-day suspension without pay was materially adverse was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I concur in the judgment, but I disagree with the major- ity's interpretation of the antiretaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, \u00a7704(a), as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-3(a). The majority's interpretation has no basis in the statutory language and will, I fear, lead to practical problems.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Two provisions of Title VII are important here. Section 703(a) prohibits a broad range of discriminatory employ- ment practices.<sup>[1]</sup> Among other things, \u00a7703(a) makes it unlawful for an employer \"<i>to discriminate against</i> any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi- tions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi- vidual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>A complementary and closely related provision, \u00a7704(a), makes it unlawful to \"discriminate against\" an employee for retaliatory purposes. Section 704(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to <i>discriminate against</i> any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has op- posed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-3(a) (em- phasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, we must ascertain the meaning of the term \"discriminate\" in \u00a7704(a). Two possible interpretations are suggested by the language of \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a).</p>\n<p>The first is the interpretation that immediately springs to mind if \u00a7704(a) is read by itself\u0097<i>i.e.</i>, that the term \"discriminate\" in \u00a7704(a) means what the term literally means, to treat differently. Respondent staunchly defends this interpretation, which the majority does not embrace, but this interpretation presents problems that are at least sufficient to raise doubts about its correctness. Respon- dent's interpretation makes \u00a7703(a) narrower in scope than \u00a7704(a) and thus implies that the persons whom Title VII is principally designed to protect\u0097victims of discrimi- nation based on race, color, sex, national origin, or relig- ion\u0097receive less protection than victims of retaliation. In addition, respondent's interpretation \"makes a federal case\" out of any small difference in the way an employee who has engaged in protected conduct is treated. On respondent's view, a retaliation claim must go to the jury if the employee creates a genuine issue on such questions as whether the employee was given any more or less work than others, was subjected to any more or less supervision, or was treated in a somewhat less friendly manner be- cause of his protected activity. There is reason to doubt that Congress meant to burden the federal courts with claims involving relatively trivial differences in treatment. See <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998); <i>Faragher</i> v. <i>Boca Raton,</i> 524 U. S. 775, 786- 788 (1998).</p>\n<p>The other plausible interpretation, and the one I favor, reads \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a) together. Under this reading, \"discriminat[ion]\" under \u00a7704(a) means the discriminatory acts reached by \u00a7703(a)\u0097chiefly, discrimination \"with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privi- leges of employment.\" This is not, admittedly, the most straightforward reading of the bare language of \u00a7704(a), but it is a reasonable reading that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a). It also provides an objective standard that permits insignificant claims to be weeded out at the sum- mary judgment stage, while providing ample protection for employees who are subjected to real retaliation.</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals that have interpreted \u00a7704(a) in this way state that it requires a materially adverse em- ployment action. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Von Gunten</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 243 F. 3d 858, 865 (CA4 2001); <i>Gupta</i> v. <i>Florida Bd. of Re-</i> <i>gents</i>, 212 F. 3d 571, 587 (CA11 2000), cert. denied, 531 U. S. 1076 (2001); <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Pittsburgh</i>, 120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). In <i>Burlington Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ellerth</i>, 524 U. S. 742, 761-762 (1998), we \"import[ed]\" this test for use in a different context\u0097to define the term \"tangible employment action,\" a concept we used to limit an em- ployer's liability for harassment carried out by its supervi- sors. We explained that \"[a] tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\" <i>Id</i>., at 761.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The majority does not adopt either of the two interpreta- tions noted above. In Part II\u0097A of its opinion, the majority criticizes the interpretation that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7703(a) and 704(a) as not sufficiently faithful to the language of \u00a7704(a). Although we found the materially adverse em- ployment action test worthy of \"import[ation]\" in <i>Ellerth</i>, the majority now argues that this test is too narrow be- cause it permits employers to take retaliatory measures outside the workplace. <i>Ante</i>, at 8-9 (citing <i>Rochon</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 438 F. 3d 1211, 1213 (CADC 2006); <i>Berry</i> v. <i>Stevinson Chevrolet</i>, 74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996)). But the majority's concern is misplaced.</p>\n<p>First, an employer who wishes to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected conduct is much more likely to do so on the job. There are far more opportunities for retaliation in that setting, and many forms of retalia- tion off the job constitute crimes and are therefore espe- cially risky.</p>\n<p>Second, the materially adverse employment action test is not limited to on-the-job retaliation, as <i>Rochon</i>, one of the cases cited by the majority, illustrates. There, a Fed- eral Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that the Bu- reau had retaliated against him by failing to provide the off-duty security that would otherwise have been fur- nished. See 438 F. 3d, at 1213-1214. But, for an FBI agent whose life may be threatened during off-duty hours, providing security easily qualifies as a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Certainly, if the FBI had a policy of denying protection to agents of a particular race, such discrimination would be actionable under \u00a7703(a).</p>\n<p>But in Part II\u0097B, rather than adopting the more literal interpretation based on the language of \u00a7704(a) alone, the majority instead puts that language aside and adopts a third interpretation\u0097one that has no grounding in the statutory language. According to the majority, \u00a7704(a) does not reach all retaliatory differences in treatment but only those retaliatory acts that \"well might have dis- suaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I see no sound basis for this test. The language of \u00a7704(a), which employs the unadorned term \"discrimi- nate,\" does not support this test. The unstated premise of the majority's reasoning seems to be that \u00a7704(a)'s only purpose is to prevent employers from taking those actions that are likely to stop employees from complaining about discrimination, but this unstated premise is unfounded. While surely <i>one of the purposes</i> of \u00a7704(a) is to prevent employers from engaging in retaliatory measures that dissuade employees from engaging in protected conduct, there is no reason to suppose that this is \u00a7704(a)'s only purpose. Indeed, the majority itself identifies another purpose of the antiretaliation provision: \"to prevent harm to individuals\" who assert their rights. <i>Ante</i>, at 8. Under the majority's test, however, employer conduct that causes harm to an employee is permitted so long as the employer conduct is not so severe as to dissuade a reasonable em- ployee from making or supporting a charge of discrimina- tion.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended.</p>\n<p>First, the majority's test leads logically to perverse results. Under the majority's test, \u00a7704(a) reaches retalia- tion that well might dissuade an employee from making or supporting \"a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). I take it that the phrase \"<i>a</i> charge of discrimination\" means the particular charge that the employee in question filed,<sup>[2]</sup> and if that is the proper interpretation, the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge must be taken into account in applying \u00a7704(a). Specifically, the majority's interpretation logically implies that the degree of protec- tion afforded to a victim of retaliation is inversely propor- tional to the severity of the original act of discrimination that prompted the retaliation. A reasonable employee who is subjected to the most severe discrimination will not easily be dissuaded from filing a charge by the threat of retaliation; the costs of filing the charge, including possi- ble retaliation, will have to be great to outweigh the bene- fits, such as preventing the continuation of the discrimina- tion in the future and obtaining damages and other relief for past discrimination. Because the possibility of rela- tively severe retaliation will not easily dissuade this em- ployee, the employer will be able to engage in relatively severe retaliation without incurring liability under \u00a7704(a). On the other hand, an employee who is subjected to a much milder form of discrimination will be much more easily dissuaded. For this employee, the costs of complain- ing, including possible retaliation, will not have to be great to outweigh the lesser benefits that might be obtained by filing a charge. These topsy-turvy results make no sense.</p>\n<p>Second, the majority's conception of a reasonable worker is unclear. Although the majority first states that its test is whether a \"reasonable worker\" might well be dissuaded, <i>ante</i>, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), it later suggests that at least some individual characteristics of the actual retaliation victim must be taken into account. The majority comments that \"the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances,\" and provides the following illustration: \"A schedule change in an employee's work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 14.</p>\n<p>This illustration suggests that the majority's test is not whether an act of retaliation well might dissuade the average reasonable worker, putting aside all individual characteristics, but, rather, whether the act well might dissuade a reasonable worker who shares at least some individual characteristics with the actual victim. The majority's illustration introduces three individual charac- teristics: age, gender, and family responsibilities. How many more individual characteristics a court or jury may or must consider is unclear.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority's interpretation contains a loose and unfamiliar causation standard. As noted, the major- ity's test asks whether an employer's retaliatory act \"<i>well</i> <i>might have dissuaded</i> a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Especially in an area of the law in which standards of causation are already complex, the introduction of this new and unclear standard is unwelcome.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority's test but would hold that \u00a7704(a) reaches only those discrimina- tory practices covered by \u00a7703(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Applying this interpretation, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. The actions taken against re- spondent\u0097her assignment to new and substantially less desirable duties and her suspension without pay\u0097fall within the definition of an \"adverse employment action.\"</p>\n<p>With respect to respondent's reassignment, <i>Ellerth</i> specifically identified a \"reassignment with significantly different responsibilities\" as a \"tangible employment action.\" 524 U. S., at 761. Here, as the Court of Appeals stated, \"[i]n essence, . . . the reassignment was a demo- tion.\" 364 F. 3d 789, 803 (CA6 2004). The \"new position was by all accounts more arduous and 'dirtier,'\" <i>ibid</i>., and petitioner's sole stated rationale for the reassignment was that respondent's prior duties were better suited for some- one with greater seniority. This was virtually an admis- sion that respondent was demoted when those responsi- bilities were taken away from her.</p>\n<p>I would hold that respondent's suspension without pay likewise satisfied the materially adverse employment action test. Accordingly, although I would hold that a plaintiff asserting a \u00a7704(a) retaliation claim must show the same type of materially adverse employment action that is required for a \u00a7703(a) discrimination claim, I would hold that petitioner met that standard in this case, and I, therefore, concur in the judgment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 703(a) states in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or <i>other-</i> <i>wise to discriminate against</i> any individual with respect to his compen- sation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n<p>\"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[2]  The alternative interpretation\u0097that \"a charge\" does not mean the specific charge filed by the employee but an average or generic charge\u0097 would be unworkable. Without gauging the severity of the initial alleged discrimination, a jury cannot possibly compare the costs and benefits of filing a charge and, thus, cannot possibly decide whether the employer's alleged retaliatory conduct is severe enough to dissuade the filing of a charge. A jury will have no way of assessing the severity of the average alleged act of discrimination that leads to the filing of a charge, and, therefore, if \"a charge\" means an average or generic charge, the majority's test will leave juries hopelessly at sea.</p>\n\n</div>",
