Hughes, Justice Complex, Trenton, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The States of Delaware and New Jersey seek this Court's resolution of a dispute concerning their respective regulatory authority over a portion of the Delaware River within a circle of twelve miles centered on the town of New Castle, Delaware. In an earlier contest between the two States, this Court upheld the title of Delaware to \"the river and the subaqueous soil\" within the circle \"up to [the] low water mark on the easterly or New Jersey side.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> 291 U.S. 361, 385, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware II).</i><sup>[1]</sup> Prior to that 1934 boundary determination, in 1905, the two States had entered into an accord (1905 Compact or Compact), which Congress ratified in 1907. The Compact accommodated both States' concerns on matters over which the States had crossed swords: service of civil and criminal process on vessels and rights of fishery within the twelve-mile zone. Although the parties were unable to reach agreement on the interstate boundary at that time, the 1905 Compact contained two jurisdictional provisions important to the current dispute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Art. VII. Each State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature, and to make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights under the laws of the respective States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Art. VIII. Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" Act of Jan. 24, 1907, 34 Stat. 860.</blockquote>\n<p>The controversy we here resolve was sparked by Delaware's refusal to grant permission for construction of a liquefied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1416</span> natural gas (LNG) unloading terminal that would extend some 2,000 feet from New Jersey's shore into territory <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> adjudged to belong to Delaware. The LNG plant, storage tanks, and other structures would be maintained onshore in New Jersey. Relying on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, New Jersey urged that it had exclusive jurisdiction over all projects appurtenant to its shores, including wharves extending past the low-water mark on New Jersey's side into Delaware territory. Delaware asserted regulatory authority, undiminished by Article VII, over structures located within its borders; in support, Delaware invoked, <i>inter alia,</i> Article VIII of the 1905 Compact and our decision in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II.</i> The Special Master we appointed to superintend the proceedings filed a report recommending a determination that Delaware has authority to regulate the proposed construction, concurrently with New Jersey, to the extent that the project reached beyond New Jersey's border and extended into Delaware's domain.</p>\n<p>We accept the Special Master's recommendation in principal part. Article VII of the 1905 Compact, we hold, did not secure to New Jersey <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction over all riparian improvements commencing on its shores.<sup>[2]</sup> The parties' own conduct, since the time Delaware has endeavored to regulate coastal development, supports the conclusion to which other relevant factors point: New Jersey and Delaware have overlapping authority to regulate riparian structures and operations of extraordinary character extending outshore of New Jersey's domain into territory over which Delaware is sovereign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Disputes between New Jersey and Delaware concerning the boundary along the Delaware River (or River) separating the two States have persisted \"almost from the beginning of statehood.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> 291 U.S., at 376, 54 S.Ct. 407. The history of the States' competing claims of sovereignty, rehearsed at length in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> need not be detailed here. In brief, tracing title through a series of deeds originating with a 1682 grant from the Duke of York to William Penn, Delaware asserted dominion, within the twelve-mile circle, over the River and its subaqueous lands up to the low-water mark on the New Jersey side. <i>Id.,</i> at 364, 374, 54 S.Ct. 407.<sup>[3]</sup> New Jersey claimed sovereign ownership up to the middle of the navigable channel. <i>Id.,</i> at 363-364, 54 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p>The instant proceeding is the third original action New Jersey has commenced against Delaware involving the Delaware River boundary between the two States. The first action, <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> No. 1, Orig. (filed 1877) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware I),</i> was propelled by the States' disagreements over fishing rights. See Report of Special Master 3 (Report).<sup>[4]</sup> That case \"slumbered for many years.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> 291 U.S., at 377, 54 S.Ct. 407. Eventually, the parties negotiated a Compact, which both States approved in 1905, and Congress ratified in 1907. See Act of Jan. 24, 1907, ch. 394, 34 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1417</span> Stat. 858. Modest in comparison to the parties' initial aim, the Compact left location of the interstate boundary an unsettled question.<sup>[5]</sup> New Jersey then withdrew its complaint and this Court dismissed the case without prejudice. <i>New Jersey v. Delaware I,</i> 205 U.S. 550, 27 S.Ct. 793, 51 L.Ed. 925 (1907).</p>\n<p>The second original action, <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> was fueled by a dispute over ownership of an oyster bed in the River below the twelve-mile circle. See Report 14. In response to New Jersey's complaint, the Court conclusively settled the boundary between the States. Confirming the Special Master's report, the Court held that, within the twelve-mile circle, Delaware owns the River and the subaqueous soil up to the low-water mark on the New Jersey side. 291 U.S., at 385, 54 S.Ct. 407.<sup>[6]</sup> But New Jersey gained the disputed oyster bed: South of the circle, the Court adjudged the boundary \"to be the middle of the main ship channel in Delaware River and Bay.\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> 295 U.S. 694, 699, 55 S.Ct. 907, 79 L.Ed. 1659 (1935) (Decree) (perpetually enjoining the States from further disputing the boundary).</p>\n<p>In upholding Delaware's title to the area within the twelve-mile circle, the Court rejected an argument pressed by New Jersey based on the 1905 Compact: By agreeing to the Compact, New Jersey urged, Delaware had abandoned any claim of ownership beyond the middle of the River. The Court found New Jersey's argument \"wholly without force.\" 291 U.S., at 377, 54 S.Ct. 407. \"The compact of 1905,\" the Court declared, \"provides for the enjoyment of riparian rights, for concurrent jurisdiction in respect of civil and criminal process, and for concurrent rights of fishery. Beyond that it does not go.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 377-378, 54 S.Ct. 407. The Court next recited in full the text of Article VIII of the Compact: \"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 378, 54 S.Ct. 407 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The current controversy arose out of the planned construction of facilities to import, store, and vaporize foreign-source LNG; the proposed project would be operated by Crown Landing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of British Petroleum (BP). See Report 19; 6 App. of Delaware on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment 3793, 3804-3807 (hereinafter Del.App.) (Request for Coastal Zone Status Decision). The \"Crown Landing\" project would include a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1418</span> gasification plant, storage tanks, and other structures onshore in New Jersey, and a pier and related structures extending some 2,000 feet from New Jersey's shore into Delaware. Report 19-20; 6 Del.App. 3804. Supertankers with capacities of up to 200,000 cubic meters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship then carrying natural gas) would berth at the pier. <i>Id.,</i> at 3810.<sup>[7]</sup> A multipart transfer system \u0097 including, <i>inter alia,</i> cryogenic piping, a containment trough, and utility lines \u0097 would be installed on the 6,000-square-foot unloading platform and along the pier to transport the LNG (at sufficiently cold temperatures to keep it in a liquid state) from ships to three 158,000-cubic-meter storage tanks onshore; vapor byproducts resulting from the onshore gasification would be returned to the tankers. Report 19-20; 6 Del.App. 3804; 7 <i>id.,</i> at 4307 (Cherry Affidavit). Even \"[d]uring the holding mode of terminal operation (when no ship is unloading),\" LNG would circulate through the piping along the pier to \"keep the line cold.\" 6 <i>id.,</i> at 3804. Construction of the Crown Landing project would require dredging 1.24 million cubic yards of subaqueous soil, affecting approximately 29 acres of the riverbed within Delaware's territory. Report 19-20.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In September 2004, BP sought permission from Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to construct the Crown Landing unloading terminal. See <i>id.,</i> at 20.<sup>[9]</sup> DNREC refused permission some months later on the ground that the terminal was barred by Delaware's Coastal Zone Act (DCZA), Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001 <i>et seq.</i> (2001),<sup>[10]</sup> as a prohibited \"offshore . . . bulk product transfer facilit[y]\" as well as a prohibited \" heavy industry us[e],\" \u00a7 7003; Report 20.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Reactions to DNREC's decision boiled over on both sides. New Jersey threatened to withdraw state pension funds from Delaware banks, and Delaware considered authorizing the National Guard to protect its border from encroachment. See Report <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1419</span> 21. One New Jersey legislator looked into recommissioning the museum-piece battleship U.S.S. <i>New Jersey,</i> in the event that the vessel might be needed to repel an armed invasion by Delaware. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>New Jersey commenced the instant action in 2005, seeking a declaration that Article VII of the 1905 Compact establishes its exclusive jurisdiction \"to regulate the construction of improvements appurtenant to the New Jersey shore of the Delaware River within the Twelve-Mile Circle, free of regulation by Delaware.\" Motion to Reopen and for Supplemental Decree 35; see Report 22, 29. We granted leave to file a bill of complaint. 546 U.S. 1028, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 566 (2005). Delaware opposed New Jersey's reading of Article VII, and maintained that the 1905 Compact did not give New Jersey exclusive authority to \"approve projects that encroach on Delaware submerged lands without any say by Delaware.\" Brief for Delaware in Opposition to New Jersey's Motion to Reopen and for Supplemental Decree 21; see Report 23, 29.</p>\n<p>The Special Master appointed by the Court, Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr., 546 U.S. 1147, 126 S.Ct. 1183, 163 L.Ed.2d 1125 (2006), superintended discovery and carefully considered nearly 6,500 pages of materials presented by the parties in support of cross-motions for summary judgment. Report 27. He ultimately determined that the \"riparian jurisdiction\" preserved to New Jersey by Article VII of the 1905 Compact \"is not exclusive\" and that Delaware \"has overlapping jurisdiction to regulate. . . improvements outshore of the low water mark on the New Jersey side of the River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. New Jersey filed exceptions to which we now turn.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At the outset, we summarize our decision and the principal reasons for it. In accord with the Special Master, we hold that Article VII of the 1905 Compact does not grant New Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian improvements extending outshore of the low-water mark. First, the novel term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" which the parties employed in the Compact, is properly read as a limiting modifier and not as synonymous with \"exclusive jurisdiction.\" Second, an 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York casts informative light on the later New Jersey-Delaware accord. Third, our decision in <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> 540 U.S. 56, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), provides scant support for New Jersey's claim. We there held that a Maryland-Virginia <i>boundary settlement</i> gave Virginia \"sovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to build improvements appurtenant to [Virginia's] shore and to withdraw water from the [Potomac] River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. Delaware's 1905 agreement to New Jersey's exercise of \"riparian jurisdiction,\" <i>made when the boundary was still disputed,</i> cannot plausibly be read as an equivalent recognition of New Jersey's sovereign authority. Finally, Delaware's claim to regulating authority is supported by New Jersey's acceptance (until the present controversy) of Delaware's jurisdiction over water and land within its domain to preserve the quality and prevent deterioration of the State's coastal areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1420</span> A</h2>\n<p>New Jersey hinges its case on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, which it reads as conferring on \"each State complete regulatory authority over the construction and operation of riparian improvements on its shores, even if the improvements extend past the low-water mark.\" Exceptions by New Jersey to Report of Special Master and Supporting Brief 16 (hereinafter New Jersey Exceptions). <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> New Jersey recognizes, confirmed Delaware's sovereign ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within the twelve-mile circle. But, New Jersey emphasizes, the Court expressly made that determination \"subject to the Compact of 1905.\" 291 U.S., at 385, 54 S.Ct. 407. New Jersey acknowledges that Delaware \"unquestionably can exercise its police power outshore of the low-water mark.\" New Jersey Exceptions 16. New Jersey contends, however, that Delaware cannot do so in a manner that would interfere with the authority over riparian rights that Article VII of the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Because the meaning of the 1905 Compact and, in particular, Article VII, is key to the resolution of this controversy, we focus our attention on that issue. Significantly, Article VII provides that \"[e]ach State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise\" not \"exclusive jurisdiction\" or \"jurisdiction\" unmodified, but \"riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature\" 34 Stat. 860. New Jersey argues that \"riparian jurisdiction\" should be read broadly to encompass full police-power jurisdiction over activities carried out on riparian structures. New Jersey Exceptions 36-37. If New Jersey enjoys full police power over improvements extending from its shore, New Jersey reasons, then necessarily Delaware cannot encroach on that authority. See Report 54.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>We agree with the Special Master that \"`riparian' is a limiting modifier.\" Report 57. Interpreting an interstate compact, \"[j]ust as if [we] were addressing a federal statute,\" <i>New Jersey v. New York,</i> 523 U.S. 767, 811, 118 S.Ct. 1726, 140 L.Ed.2d 993 (1998), it would be appropriate to construe a compact term in accord with its common-law meaning, see <i>Morissette v. United States,</i> 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). The term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" however, was not a legal term of art in 1905, nor is it one now. See 7 Del.App. 4281 (Expert Report of Professor Joseph L. Sax (Nov. 7, 2006)). As the Special Master stated, \"riparian jurisdiction\" appears to be a verbal formulation \"devised by the [1905 Compact] drafters specifically for Article VII.\" Report 54.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the Compact, one finds the more familiar terms \"jurisdiction\" (in the introductory paragraphs and, most notably, in Article VIII) or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" (in Article IV).<sup>[14]</sup> To attribute to \"riparian jurisdiction\" the same meaning as \"jurisdiction\" unmodified, or to equate the novel term with the distinct formulation \"exclusive jurisdiction,\" would deny <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1421</span> operative effect to each word in the Compact, contrary to basic principles of construction. See <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955).</p>\n<p>In this regard, Article VIII bears reiteration:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" 34 Stat. 860.</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably drafted in recognition of the still-unresolved boundary dispute, see <i>supra,</i> at ___ _ ___, Article VIII requires an express statement in the Compact in order to \"affect the territorial . . . jurisdiction of either State . . . over the Delaware River.\" We resist reading the uncommon term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" even when aggrandized by the phrase \"of every kind and nature,\" as tantamount to an express cession by Delaware of its entire \"territorial. . . jurisdiction . . . over the Delaware River.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Endeavoring to fathom the import of the novel term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" the Special Master recognized that a riparian landowner ordinarily enjoys the right to build a wharf to access navigable waters far enough to permit the loading and unloading of ships. Report 47-49, 58-59. Accord 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 279 (1904) (\"The riparian owner is also entitled to have his contact with the water remain intact. This is what is known as the right of access, and includes the right to erect wharves to reach the navigable portion of the stream.\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 111, p. 520 (\"A wharf is a structure on the margin of navigable water, alongside of which vessels are brought for the sake of being conveniently loaded or unloaded.\"). But the Special Master also recognized that the right of a riparian owner to wharf out is subject to state regulation. Report 58; see 1 Farnham, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 63, p. 284 (rights of riparian owner \"are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public\"); <i>Shively v. Bowlby,</i> 152 U.S. 1, 40, 14 S.Ct. 548, 38 L.Ed. 331 (1894) (\"[A] riparian proprietor . . . has the right of access to the navigable part of the stream in front of his land, and to construct a wharf or pier projecting into the stream . . ., subject to such general rules and regulations as the legislature may prescribe for the protection of the public . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>New Jersey took no issue with the Special Master's recognition that States, in the public interest, may place restrictions on a riparian proprietor's activities. In its response to Delaware's request for admissions, New Jersey readily acknowledged that a person wishing to conduct a particular activity on a wharf, in addition to obtaining a riparian grant, would have to comply with all other \"applicable New Jersey laws, and local laws.\" 6 Del.App. 4156 (New Jersey's Responses to Delaware's First Request for Admissions \u00b6 22 (Sept. 8, 2006)). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 856, Comment <i>e,</i> pp. 246-247 (1977) (\"A state may exercise its police power by controlling the initiation and conduct of riparian and nonriparian uses of water.\"). But New Jersey sees itself, to the exclusion of Delaware, as the State empowered to regulate, for the benefit of the public, New Jersey landowners' exercise of riparian rights.</p>\n<p>In the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is also the State that has regulatory authority over the exercise of those rights. But cf. <i>Cummings v. Chicago,</i> 188 U.S. 410, 431, 23 S.Ct. 472, 47 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1422</span> L.Ed. 525 (1903) (federal regulation of wharfing out in the Calumet River did not divest local government of regulatory authority based on location of project within that government's territory). In this regard, the negotiators of the 1905 Compact faced an unusual situation: As long as the boundary issue remained unsettled, they could not know which State was sovereign within the twelve-mile circle beyond New Jersey's shore. They likely knew, however, that \"[i]n a case of wharfing out . . . `[t]he rights of a riparian owner upon a navigable stream in this country are governed by the law of the state in which the stream is situated.'\" 1 S. Wiel, Water Rights in the Western States \u00a7 898, p. 934 (3d ed.1911) (quoting <i>Weems Steamboat Co. of Baltimore v. People's Steamboat Co.,</i> 214 U.S. 345, 355, 29 S.Ct. 661, 53 L.Ed. 1024 (1909)). With the issue of sovereignty reserved by the 1905 Compact drafters for another day, the Special Master's conclusion that Article VII's reference to \"riparian jurisdiction\" did not mean \"exclusive jurisdiction\" is difficult to gainsay.</p>\n<p>The Special Master pertinently observed that, as New Jersey read the 1905 Compact, Delaware had given up all governing authority over the disputed area while receiving nothing in return. He found New Jersey's position \"implausible.\" Report 63. \"Delaware,\" the Special Master stated, \"would not have willingly ceded all jurisdiction over matters taking place on land that [Delaware adamantly] contended it owned exclusively and outright.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 64.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>New Jersey asserts that Delaware did just that, as shown by representations made during proceedings in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II.</i> New Jersey Exceptions 44. Delaware's reply brief before the Special Master in that case stated: \"Article VII of the Compact is obviously merely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of New Jersey and a cession to the State of New Jersey by the State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those rights.\" 1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary Judgment 123a. Further, at oral argument before the Special Master in that earlier fray, Delaware's counsel said that, in his view, the 1905 Compact \"ceded to the State of New Jersey all the right to control the erection of [wharves extending into the Delaware River from New Jersey's shore] and to say who shall erect them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126a-1.</p>\n<p>The Special Master in the instant case found New Jersey's position dubious, as do we. The representations Delaware made in the course of <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the Special Master here observed, were \"fully consistent with [the Master's] interpretation of Article VII [of the 1905 Compact].\" Report 89. New Jersey did indeed preserve \"the right to exercise its own jurisdiction over riparian improvements appurtenant to its shore.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But, critically, Delaware nowhere \"suggested that New Jersey would have the <i>exclusive</i> authority to regulate all aspects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1423</span> of riparian improvements, even if on Delaware's land.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Delaware, in its argument before the Special Master, was equally uncompromising. As a result of the 1934 boundary determination, Delaware urged, \"the entire River is on Delaware's `own side,' and New Jersey consequently ha[d] no `side' of the River on which to exercise any riparian rights or riparian jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 36. Article VII of the 1905 Compact, according to Delaware, was a \"temporary\" measure, \"entirely . . . contingent on the ultimate resolution of the boundary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 39. That reading, the Special Master demonstrated, was altogether fallacious. <i>Id.,</i> at 36-40.</p>\n<p>Seeking to harmonize Article VII with the boundary determination, the Special Master reached these conclusions. First, the 1905 Compact gave New Jersey no authority to <i>grant</i> lands owned by Delaware. <i>Id.,</i> at 45-46. Second, Article VII's preservation to each State of \"riparian jurisdiction\" means that New Jersey may control the riparian rights ordinarily and usually enjoyed by landowners on New Jersey's shore. For example, New Jersey may define \"how far a riparian owner can wharf out, the quantities of water that a riparian owner can draw from the River, and the like.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 57-58. Nevertheless, New Jersey's regulatory authority is qualified once the boundary line at low water is passed. <i>Id.,</i> at 58. Just as New Jersey cannot grant land belonging to Delaware, so New Jersey cannot authorize activities that go beyond the exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights in the face of contrary regulation by Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Interstate compacts, like treaties, are presumed to be \"the subject of careful consideration before they are entered into, and are drawn by persons competent to express their meaning, and to choose apt words in which to embody the purposes of the high contracting parties.\" <i>Rocca v. Thompson,</i> 223 U.S. 317, 332, 32 S.Ct. 207, 56 L.Ed. 453 (1912). Accordingly, the Special Master found informative a comparison of language in the 1905 Compact with language contained in an 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York. See Report 65. That compact established the two States' common boundary along the Hudson River. Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, 4 Stat. 708. Similar to the boundary between New Jersey and Delaware settled in 1934 in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the 1834 accord located the New Jersey-New York boundary at \"the low water-mark on the westerly or New Jersey side [of the Hudson River].\" Art. Third, 4 Stat. 710; cf. <i>supra,</i> at 1415. The 1834 agreement, however, expressly gave to New Jersey \"the <i>exclusive right</i> of property in and to the land under water lying west of the middle of the bay of New York, and west of the middle of that part of the Hudson river which lies between Manhattan island and New Jersey\" and \"<i>the exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made on the shore of the said state</i> . . .\" Art. Third, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4 Stat. 710 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\"Comparable language [conferring exclusive authority],\" the Special Master observed, \"is noticeably absent in the [1905] Compact.\" Report 66. The Master found this disparity \"conspicuous,\" <i>id.,</i> at 68, for \"[s]everal provisions in the two interstate compacts [contain] strikingly similar language,\" <i>id.,</i> at 66; see <i>id.,</i> App. J (Table Comparing Similar Provisions in the New Jersey-New York Compact of 1834 and the New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905). Given that provisions of the 1905 Compact appear to have been adopted almost verbatim from New Jersey's 1834 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1424</span> accord with New York, see <i>ibid.,</i> New Jersey could hardly claim ignorance that Article VII could have been drafted to grant New Jersey \"exclusive jurisdiction\" (not merely \"riparian jurisdiction\") over wharves and other improvements extending from its shore into navigable Delaware River waters. <i>Id.,</i> at 67.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>New Jersey urged before the Special Master, and in its exceptions to his report, that <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> 540 U.S. 56, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461, is dispositive of this case.<sup>[17]</sup> Both cases involved an interstate compact, which left the boundary between the contending States unresolved, and a later determination settling the boundary. And both original actions were referred to Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr., as Special Master. We find persuasive the Special Master's reconciliation of his recommendations in the two actions. See Report 64-65, n. 118.</p>\n<p><i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> involved a 1785 compact and an 1877 arbitration award. Agreeing with the Special Master, we held that the arbitration award permitted Virginia to construct a water intake structure extending into the Potomac River, even though the award placed Virginia's boundary at the low-water mark on its own side of the Potomac. See 540 U.S., at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. \"Superficially,\" the Special Master said, \"that holding would appear to support New Jersey's argument here, <i>i.e.,</i> that construction of wharves off New Jersey's shore should not be subject to regulation by Delaware.\" Report 64, n. 118. But, the Special Master explained, the result in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> turned on \"the unique language of the compact and arbitration award involved in that case.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The key provision of the 1785 compact between Maryland and Virginia, we observed, addressed only \"the right [of the citizens of each State] to build wharves and improvements regardless of which State ultimately was determined to be sovereign over the River.\" 540 U.S., at. 69, 124 S.Ct. 598. Concerning the rights of the States, the 1877 arbitration award, not the 1785 compact, was definitive. See <i>id.,</i> at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. The key provision of that award recognized the right of Virginia, \"<i>qua</i> sovereign,\" \"to use the River beyond low-water mark,\" a right \"nowhere made subject to Maryland's regulatory authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598.</p>\n<p>Confirming the \"sovereign character\" of Virginia's right, we noted, Maryland had proposed to the arbitrators that the boundary line between the States be drawn around \"all wharves and other improvements now extending or which may hereafter be extended, by authority of Virginia from the Virginia shore into the [Potomac] beyond low water mark.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the formulation Maryland proposed was not used in the arbitration award, the arbitrators plainly manifested their intention to accomplish the same end: to safeguard \"Virginia's authority to construct riparian improvements outshore of the low water mark without regulation by Maryland.\" Report 65, n. 118; see <i>Virginia v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1425</span> <i>Maryland,</i> 540 U.S., at 73, n. 7, 124 S.Ct. 598. By contrast, in the instant case, neither the 1905 Compact, nor <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the 1934 decision settling the boundary dispute, purported to give New Jersey \"all regulatory oversight (as opposed to merely riparian oversight)\" or to endow New Jersey with authority \"exclusive of jurisdiction by Delaware.\" Report 65, n. 118; see <i>supra,</i> at 1420-1423.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>We turn, finally, to the parties' prior course of conduct, on which the Special Master placed considerable weight. See Report 68-84; cf. <i>O'Connor v. United States,</i> 479 U.S. 27, 33, 107 S.Ct. 347, 93 L.Ed.2d 206 (1986) (\"The course of conduct of parties to an international agreement, like the course of conduct of parties to any contract, is evidence of its meaning.\").</p>\n<p>Until the 1960's, wharfing out from the New Jersey shore into Delaware territory was not a matter of controversy between the two States. From 1851, when New Jersey began issuing grants for such activity, through 1969, only 11 constructions straddled the interstate boundary. Report 74. At the time of the 1905 Compact and continuing into the 1950's, Delaware, unlike New Jersey, issued no grants or leases for its subaqueous lands. Delaware regulated riparian improvements solely under its common law, which limited developments only to the extent they constituted public nuisances. <i>Id.,</i> at 69.</p>\n<p>In 1961, Delaware enacted its first statute regulating submerged lands, and in 1966, it enacted broader legislation governing leases of state-owned subaqueous lands. <i>Id.,</i> at 70. The State grandfathered piers and wharves built prior to the effective date of the regulations implementing the 1966 statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 70-71. Permits were required, however, for modifications to the grandfathered structures and for new structures. <i>Id.,</i> at 71.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Then, in 1971, Delaware enacted the DCZA to prevent \"a significant danger of pollution to the coastal zone.\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001. The DCZA prohibits within the coastal zone \"[h]eavy industry uses of any kind\" and \"offshore gas, liquid or solid bulk product transfer facilities.\" \u00a7 7003. In 1972, Delaware rejected as a prohibited bulk transfer facility El Paso Eastern Company's request to build a LNG unloading facility extending from New Jersey into Delaware. 5 Del.App. 3483 (Letter from David Keifer, Director of Delaware State Planning Office, to Barry Huntsinger, El Paso Eastern Company (Feb. 23, 1972)). Shortly before denying El Paso's application, Delaware notified New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), which raised no objection to Delaware's refusal to permit the LNG terminal.<sup>[19]</sup> Delaware similarly relied on the DCZA to deny permits for construction of the Crown Landing unloading facility at issue in this case. Report 20.</p>\n<p>Also in 1972, Congress enacted the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 86 Stat. 1280, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 <i>et seq.,</i> which required States to submit their coastal management programs to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1426</span> In return, States with approved programs would receive federal funding for coastal management. See \u00a7\u00a7 1454-1455. Delaware's coastal management program, approved by the Secretary in 1979, specifically addressed LNG facilities and reported that \"`no site in Delaware [is] suitable for the location of any LNG import-export facility.'\" Report 72 (quoting 4 Del.App. 2591 (Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin. (NOAA), Delaware Coastal Management Program and Final Environmental Impact Statement 57 (Mar.1980))). The next year, 1980, New Jersey gained approval for its coastal management program. The Special Master found telling, as do we, a representation New Jersey made in its submission to the Secretary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The New Jersey and Delaware Coastal Management agencies . . . have concluded that any New Jersey project extending beyond mean low water <i>must obtain coastal permits from both states.</i> New Jersey and Delaware, therefore, will coordinate reviews of any proposed development that would span the interstate boundary to ensure that no development is constructed unless it would be consistent with both state coastal management programs.\" Report 81 (quoting 4 Del. App. 2657 (NOAA, N.J. Coastal Management Program and Final Impact Statement 20 (Aug.1980) (emphasis added))).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Report 72-73. That representation, the Special Master observed, \"is fundamentally inconsistent with the position advanced by New Jersey here, <i>i.e.,</i> that only New Jersey has the right to regulate such projects.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>As the Special Master reported, just three structures extending from New Jersey into Delaware were built between 1969 and 2006. Delaware's DNREC issued permits for each of them. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-76. One of those projects was undertaken by New Jersey itself. The State, in 1996, sought to refurbish a stone pier at New Jersey's Fort Mott State Park. <i>Id.,</i> at 75-76. New Jersey issued a waterfront development permit for the project, but that permit approved structures only to the low-water mark. Delaware's approval was sought and obtained for structures outshore of that point. Even during the pendency of this action, New Jersey applied to Delaware for renewal of the permit covering the portion of the Fort Mott project extending into Delaware. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p><i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> upheld Delaware's ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within the twelve-mile circle. The 1905 Compact did not ordain that this Court's 1934 settlement of the boundary would be an academic exercise with slim practical significance. Tending against a reading that would give New Jersey exclusive authority, Article VIII of the Compact, as earlier emphasized, see <i>supra,</i> at 1421, states: \"Nothing herein contained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1427</span> shall affect the territorial limits, rights or jurisdiction of either State of, in or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" Nowhere does Article VII \"expressly set forth\" Delaware's lack of any governing authority over territory within the State's own borders. Cf. Report 43-46.</p>\n<p>The Special Master correctly determined that Delaware's once \"hands off\" policy regarding coastal development did not signal that the State never could or never would assert any regulatory authority over structures using its subaqueous land. <i>Id.,</i> at 69-70. In the decades since Delaware began to manage its waters and submerged lands to prevent \"a significant danger of pollution to the coastal zone,\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001, the State has followed a consistent course: Largely with New Jersey's cooperation, Delaware has checked proposed structures and activity extending beyond New Jersey's shore into Delaware's domain in order to \"protect the natural environment of [Delaware's]. . . coastal areas.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Given the authority over riparian rights that the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey, Delaware may not impede ordinary and usual exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New Jersey's shore. The Crown Landing project, however, goes well beyond the ordinary or usual. See <i>supra,</i> at 1417-1418. Delaware's classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a \"heavy industry use\" and a \"bulk product transfer facilit[y],\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 7001, 7003, has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate.<sup>[21]</sup> Consistent with the scope of its retained police power to regulate certain riparian uses, it was within Delaware's authority to prohibit construction of the facility within its domain.<sup>[22]</sup> As recommended by the Special Master, we confirm Delaware's authority to deny permission for the Crown Landing terminal, overrule New Jersey's exceptions, and enter, with modifications consistent with this opinion, the decree proposed by the Special Master.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DECREE</h2>\n<p>The Court having exercised original jurisdiction over this controversy between two sovereign States; the issues having been referred to the Special Master appointed by the Court; the Court having received briefs and heard oral argument on New Jersey's exceptions to the Report of the Special Master and Delaware's responses thereto; and the Court having issued its Opinion, <i>supra,</i> at 1415-1427.</p>\n<p>It is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged, Declared, and Decreed as follows:</p>\n<p>1.(a) The State of New Jersey may, under its laws, grant and thereafter exercise governing authority over ordinary and usual riparian rights for the construction, maintenance, and use of wharves and other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1428</span> riparian improvements appurtenant to the eastern shore of the Delaware River within the twelve-mile circle and extending outshore of the low-water mark; and further</p>\n<p>(b) The State of Delaware may, under its laws and subject to New Jersey's authority over riparian rights as stated in the preceding paragraph, exercise governing authority over the construction, maintenance, and use of those same wharves and other improvements appurtenant to the eastern shore of the Delaware River within the twelve-mile circle and extending outshore of the low-water mark, to the extent that they exceed ordinary and usual riparian uses.</p>\n<p>(c) In refusing to permit construction of the proposed Crown Landing LNG unloading terminal, Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river and soil within the twelve-mile circle.</p>\n<p>2. Except as hereinbefore provided, the motions for summary judgment of both the States of New Jersey and Delaware are denied and their prayers for relief dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p>3. The party States shall share equally in the compensation of the Special Master and his assistants, and in the costs of this litigation incurred by the Special Master.</p>\n<p>4. The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as it may from time to time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and effect to this Decree or to effectuate the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>While I agree with most of the reasoning in the Court's opinion, I do not agree with the rule it announces, or with all of the terms of its decree. In my view, the construction and maintenance of wharves and other riparian improvements that extend into territory over which Delaware is sovereign may only be authorized by New Jersey to the extent that such activities are not inconsistent with Delaware's exercise of its police power. I therefore join paragraphs 1(c), 2, 3, and 4 of the Court's decree, and write separately to explain that in my view, New Jersey's authority to regulate beyond the low-water mark on its shore is subordinate to the paramount authority of the sovereign owner of the river, Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At common law, owners of land abutting bodies of water enjoyed certain rights by virtue of their adjacency to that water. See 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 279 (1904) (\"The riparian owner is . . . entitled to have his contact with the water remain intact. This is what is known as the right of access, and includes the right to erect wharves to reach the navigable portion of the stream\"). Yet those rights were by no means unlimited; \"[w]hile the rights of the riparian owner cannot be destroyed . . . they are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 63, at 284. See also 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 856, Comment <i>e</i> (1977) (\"[A] state may exercise its police power by controlling the initiation and conduct of riparian and nonriparian uses of water\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1429</span> From these authorities it is clear that the rights of riparian landowners are ordinarily subject to regulation by <i>some</i> State. The only relevant question, then, for purposes of this case, is <i>which</i> State. As the Court notes, \"[i]n the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is also the State that has regulatory authority over the exercise of those rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1421. But the history of the relationship between these two States vis-a-vis their jointly bounded river takes this case out of the ordinary. In light of the 1905 Compact, our previous decision in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> 291 U.S. 361, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934), and the States' course of conduct, I agree with the Court's sensible conclusion that within the twelve-mile circle, the two States' authority over riparian improvements is to some extent overlapping. In my judgment, however, that overlapping authority does not extend merely to the regulation of \"riparian structures and operations of extraordinary character\" beyond the low-water mark on New Jersey's shore, <i>ante,</i> at 1416, but to <i>all</i> riparian structures and operations extending out from New Jersey into Delaware's domain. I would hold, therefore, that New Jersey may only grant, and thereafter exercise governing authority over, the rights of construction, maintenance, and use of wharves and other riparian improvements beyond the low-water mark to the extent that the grant and exercise of those rights is not inconsistent with the police power of the State of Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> 540 U.S. 56, 80, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), I set forth my view that the rights enjoyed by riparian landowners along the Virginia shore of the Potomac River were subject to regulation by the owner of the river, Maryland. I there explained that \"th[e] landowners' riparian rights are\u0097like all riparian rights at common law\u0097subject to the paramount regulatory authority of the sovereign that owns the river, [Maryland],\" <i>id.,</i> at 82, 124 S.Ct. 598 (dissenting opinion). I would have held, therefore, that it was within Maryland's power to prevent the construction of the water intake facility that Fairfax County, Virginia, wished to build. <i>A fortiori,</i> then\u0097putting to one side the distinctions the Court today draws between the two cases, <i>ante,</i> at 1424-1425\u0097Delaware possesses the authority, under its laws, to restrict the construction of the proposed liquified natural gas facility that would extend hundreds of feet into its sovereign territory.</p>\n<p>But inherent in the notion of concurrency are limits to the authority of even the sovereign that owns the river. In <i>Virginia v. Maryland, supra</i><i>,</i> I noted that the case did not require the Court to \"determine the precise extent or character of Maryland's regulatory jurisdiction,\" because the issue presented was merely \"whether Maryland may impose <i>any</i> limits on . . . Virginia landowners whose property happens to abut the Potomac.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 82, 124 S.Ct. 598 (dissenting opinion). Similarly, in this case we need not definitively settle the extent to which there may exist limitations on Delaware's exercise of authority over its river and improvements thereon; for even Delaware's counsel conceded at argument that Delaware could not impose a total ban on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1430</span> the construction of wharves extending out from New Jersey's shores. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49, 50. Similarly, Delaware should not be permitted to treat differently riparian improvements extending outshore from New Jersey's land and those commencing on Delaware's own soil, absent some reasonable police-power purpose for that differential treatment. Apart from those clear constraints, however\u0097and subject to applicable federal law<sup>[2]</sup>\u0097in my view it is Delaware that possesses the primary authority over riparian improvements extending into its territory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Despite my differing views set forth herein, I do agree with the conclusion that Delaware may prohibit construction of the facility that spawned this complaint, and therefore join the portion of the Court's decree so finding.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice ALITO joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>With all due respect, I find the Court's opinion difficult to accept. The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905 (Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, addressed the \"exercise [of] riparian jurisdiction,\" and the power to \"make grants. . . of riparian . . . rights.\" The particular riparian right at issue here is the right of wharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power over that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the Delaware River. The Court says, however, that that jurisdiction and power was not exclusive. I find that difficult to accept, because if Delaware could forbid the wharfing out that Article VII allowed New Jersey to permit, Article VII was a ridiculous nullity. That could not be what was meant. The Court seeks to avoid that obstacle to credibility by saying that Delaware's jurisdiction and power is limited to forbidding \"activities that go beyond the exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1423. It is only \"riparian structures and operations of <i>extraordinary character\"</i> over which Delaware retains \"overlapping authority to regulate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1416 (emphasis added). But that also is difficult to accept, because the Court explains neither the meaning nor the provenance of its \"extraordinary character\" test. The exception (whatever it means) has absolutely no basis in prior law, which regards as beyond the \"ordinary and usual\" (and hence beyond the legitimate) only that wharfing out which interferes with navigation. So unheard-of is the exception that its first appearance in this case is in the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>I would sustain New Jersey's objections to the Special Master's Report.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>I must begin by clearing some underbrush. One of Delaware's principal arguments\u0097an argument accepted by the Master and implicitly accepted by the Court\u0097is that the 1905 Compact must not be construed to limit Delaware's pre-Compact (albeit at the time unrecognized) sovereign control over the Delaware River, because of the \"strong presumption against defeat of a State's title\" in interpreting agreements. See Report of Special Master 42-43 (Report) (quoting <i>United States v. Alaska,</i> 521 U.S. 1, 34, 117 S.Ct. 1888, 138 L.Ed.2d 231 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). According to Delaware, this presumption establishes that the 1905 Compact gave New Jersey the authority to <i>allocate</i> riparian rights, but left with Delaware <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1431</span> the power to <i>veto</i> exercises of those rights under its general police-power authority.</p>\n<p>I have written of this presumption elsewhere that it \"has little if any independent legal force beyond what would be dictated by normal principles of contract interpretation. It is simply a rule of presumed (or implied-in-fact) intent.\" <i>United States v. Winstar Corp.,</i> 518 U.S. 839, 920, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (opinion concurring in judgment). It is a manifestation of the commonsense intuition that a State will rarely contract away its sovereign power. That intuition is sound enough in almost all state dealings with private citizens, and in some state dealings with other States. It has no application here, however, because the whole purpose of the 1905 Compact was precisely to come to a compromise agreement on the exercise of the two States' sovereign powers. Entered into at a time when Delaware and New Jersey disputed the location of their boundary, the Compact demarcated the authority between the two States with respect to service of civil and criminal process on vessels, rights of fishery, and riparian rights on either side of the Delaware River within the circle of a 12-mile radius centered on the town of New Castle, Delaware. See Compact, 34 Stat. 858; <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> 291 U.S. 361, 377-378, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware II).</i> There is no way the Compact can be interpreted <i>other than</i> as a yielding by both States of what they claimed to be their sovereign powers. The only issue is <i>what</i> sovereign powers were yielded, and that is best determined from the language of the Compact, with no thumb on the scales.</p>\n<p>Besides relying on the presumption, the Special Master believed (and the Court believes) that New Jersey's claims must be viewed askance because it is implausible that Delaware would have \"given up all governing authority over the disputed area while receiving nothing in return.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1422. But Delaware received plenty in return. First of all, it assured access of its citizens to fisheries on the side of the river claimed by New Jersey\u0097something it evidently cared more about than the power to control wharfing out from the Jersey shore, which it had never theretofore exercised. And it obtained (as the Compact observed) \"the amicable termination\" of New Jersey's then-pending original action in the Supreme Court, which had \"been pending for twenty-seven years and upwards.\" 34 Stat. 858-859. How plausible it was that Delaware would give up anything to get rid of that suit surely depends upon how confident Delaware was that it would prevail. And to tell the truth, the case appeared to be going badly. As the Compact observed, the Supreme Court had issued a preliminary injunction against Delaware \"restraining the execution of certain statutes of the State of Delaware relating to fisheries.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 859. The order issuing that injunction had remarked that Delaware had now \"interfered with and claimed to control the right of fishing\" which New Jerseyites had \"heretofore been accustomed\" to exercise without Delaware's interference for over 70 years. Order in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> No. 1, Orig. (filed 1877), Lodging for Brief of State of Delaware in Opposition to State of New Jersey's Motion to Reopen (Tab 1). By providing for dismissal of New Jersey's suit, the Compact assured Delaware that the Supreme Court's rather ominous sounding preliminary order would not become the Court's holding, perhaps the consequence of a rationale that gave New Jersey jurisdiction in the river.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Article VII of the 1905 Compact between New Jersey and Delaware reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1432</span> \"Each State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature, and to make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights under the laws of the respective States.\" 34 Stat. 860.</blockquote>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, this provision allocates to each State jurisdiction over a bundle of rights that, at the time of the Compact, riparian landowners, or \"owners of land abutting on bodies of water,\" possessed under the common law \"by reason of their adjacency.\" 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 278 (1904) (Farnham). Those riparian rights included the right to \"fill in and to build wharves and other structures in the shallow water in front of [the upland] and below low-water mark.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 113b, at 534. A wharf, the type of structure at issue here, \"imports a place built or constructed for the purpose of loading or unloading goods.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 111, at 520, n. 1. It was considered \"a necessary incident of the right [to construct wharves and piers] that they shall project to a distance from the shore necessary to reach water which shall float vessels, the largest as well as the smallest, that are engaged in commerce upon the water into which they project.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 522. Thus, wharves could be built up to \"the point of navigability,\" J. Gould, Treatise on the Law of Waters, including Riparian Rights \u00a7 181, p. 352 (2d ed. 1891) (Gould), so long as they did not \"interfere needlessly with the right of navigation\" possessed by members of the general public upon navigable waters, 1 Farnham \u00a7 111, at 521.</p>\n<p>The two States would have been acquainted with this common law. New Jersey case law comported with the hornbook rules. According to the State's Court of Errors and Appeals, it was \"undoubted\" and the \"common understanding\" that \"the owners of land bounding on navigable waters had an absolute right to wharf out and otherwise reclaim the land down to and even below low water, provided that they did not thereby impede the paramount right of navigation.\" <i>Bell v. Gough,</i> 23 N.J.L. 624, 658 (1852) (opinion of Elmer, J.); see also J. Angell, Treatise on the Right of Property in Tide Waters and in the Soil and Shores Thereof 234 (1847) (\"[T]he right of a riparian proprietor to `wharf out' into a public river, is a local custom in New Jersey\"); Gould \u00a7 171, at 342 (\"[T]he common understanding in [New Jersey] carries the right [to wharf out] even below low-water mark, provided there is no obstruction to the navigation\"). Case authority in Delaware seems to be lacking, but in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> the State assured the Special Master at oral argument that \"it is undoubtedly true in the State of Delaware . . . that the upland owner had the right to wharf out. . . subject only that you must not . . . obstruct navigation.\" 1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary Judgment 126a-1 (hereinafter NJ App.).</p>\n<p>Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each State had \"jurisdiction\"\u0097the \"authority of a sovereign power to govern or legislate,\" Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language (1898)\u0097over wharfing out on \"its own side of the river.\" To emphasize that this jurisdiction was plenary\u0097that it included, for example, not merely the power to prohibit wharfing out but also the power to permit it\u0097Article VII specified that the jurisdiction it conferred would be \"of every kind and nature.\"</p>\n<p>And finally, the jurisdictional grant was not framed as though it was conferring on either State some hitherto unexercised power. Rather, the Compact provided that each State would <i>\"continue to</i>\" exercise the allocated \"riparian jurisdiction,\" clearly envisioning that each State would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1433</span> wield in the future the same authority over riparian rights it had wielded in the past. 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). This is significant because, before adoption of the Compact in 1905, New Jersey alone had regulated the construction of riparian improvements on New Jersey's side of the Delaware River. It had repeatedly authorized the construction of piers and wharves that extended beyond the low-water line. App. to Report C-4 to C-5 (listing New Jersey Acts authorizing riparian landowners to construct wharves); 7 NJ App. 1196a-1199a. Delaware, by contrast, had never regulated riparian rights on the New Jersey side, and indeed, at the time of the Compact even on its own side there was \"little evidence of [the State's] active involvement in shoreland development. . . .\" Report 69.</p>\n<p>I would think all of this quite conclusive of the fact that New Jersey was given full and exclusive control over riparian rights on the New Jersey side. The Court concludes that this was not so, however, in part because of the alleged implausibility of Delaware's \"giv[ing] up all governing authority . . . while receiving nothing in return,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1422 (a mistaken contention that I have already addressed), and in part because \"riparian jurisdiction\" is different from \"exclusive jurisdiction,\" the term used in an 1834 Compact between New Jersey and New York, which referred to \"the exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made on the shore . . . .\" Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, Art. Third, 4 Stat. 710.</p>\n<p>I willingly concede that exclusive riparian jurisdiction is not the same as \"exclusive jurisdiction\" <i>simpliciter.</i> It includes only exclusive jurisdiction over <i>riparian rights</i> which, as I have described, include the right to erect wharves <i>for the loading and unloading of goods.</i> That jurisdiction does not necessarily include, for example, the power to permit or forbid the construction of a casino on the wharf, or even the power to serve legal process on the wharf. Jurisdiction to control such matters\u0097which were not established as part of riparian rights by the common-law and hornbook sources that the parties relied on in framing the Compact\u0097may well fall outside the scope of the \"riparian jurisdiction\" that the Compact grants. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tewksbury v. Deerfield Beach,</i> 763 So.2d 1071 (Fla.App.1999) (operation of a restaurant on a dock is not included within riparian rights). Such powers\u0097which may well have been conveyed by a grant of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" such as that contained in the New York-New Jersey Compact\u0097are not at issue in this case. What is at issue is jurisdiction over the core riparian right of building a wharf to be used for the loading and unloading of cargo. And that <i>that</i> jurisdiction was given exclusively to New Jersey is made perfectly clear by the Compact's recognition of each State's riparian jurisdiction only \"<i>on its own side of the river.\"</i> 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). It does not take vast experience in textual interpretation to conclude that this implicitly excludes each State's riparian jurisdiction <i>on the other State's side of the river. (Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.)</i> There was no need, therefore, to specify <i>exclusive</i> riparian jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court's position gains no support from the fact that the rights of a private riparian owner \"`are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1421 (quoting 1 Farnham \u00a7 63, at 284). The Compact did not purport to convey mere private rights, but rather \"riparian <i>jurisdiction</i> of every kind and nature.\" If that means anything at all, it means that <i>New Jersey</i> is the State that \"may regulate [the] exercise [of the rights of a private riparian owner] in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1434</span> the interest of the public.\" Delaware's contention that it retains the authority to prohibit under its police power even those activities that are specifically allowed to New Jersey under the Compact renders not just Article VII but most of the Compact a virtual nullity. Article III, for example, gives the States \"common right of fishery throughout, in, and over the waters\" of the Delaware. 34 Stat. 859. But under its police powers a sovereign State could regulate fishing within its public navigable waters. See Gould \u00a7 189, at 362. Thus, under Delaware's view, just as its ownership of the riverbed would allow it to trump New Jersey's authority to permit wharfing out, so also its ownership of the riverbed would allow it to prevent fishing. That would be an extraordinary result, since the litigation the 1905 Compact was designed to resolve arose over fishing rights, after Delaware enacted a law in 1871 requiring New Jersey fishermen to obtain a Delaware license. See Report 3-6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court, following the Special Master's analysis, see Report 68-84, asserts that today's judgment is supported by the parties' course of conduct after conclusion of the Compact. I frankly think post-Compact conduct irrelevant to this case, since it can properly be used only to clarify an ambiguous agreement, and there is no ambiguity here. The Court, moreover, overstates the post-Compact conduct favoring Delaware's position and understates the post-Compact conduct favoring New Jersey. But even if post-Compact conduct is consulted, no such conduct\u0097none whatever\u0097supports the Court's \"extraordinary character\" test, whereas several instances of such conduct strongly support the resolution I have suggested in this dissent.</p>\n<p>The Court relies upon four instances of Delaware's exercise of jurisdiction over wharfing out from the Jersey shore, and two instances of New Jersey's acquiescence in such an exercise\u0097all postdating 1969. As to the former, the three structures extending from New Jersey into Delaware built between 1969 and 2006 were permitted by Delaware, <i>ante,</i> at 1426; and another application for a permit was denied, <i>ante,</i> at 1425-1426. The Court never establishes, however, that these instances of Delaware's assertion of jurisdiction related to wharves of \"extraordinary character,\" which is the only jurisdiction that the Court's decree confers upon Delaware. At best, these assertions of jurisdiction support not the Court's opinion, but rather Delaware's assertion that it may regulate all wharves on the river\u0097an assertion that the Court rejects. The same mismatch is present with both instances of New Jersey's asserted acquiescence. One of them was New Jersey's application for Delaware's permission to refurbish the stone pier at Fort Mott State Park, described <i>ante,</i> at 1426. That construction could not conceivably be characterized as of \"extraordinary character,\" and thus New Jersey did not need to ask Delaware for permission under the Court's theory. In the other instance, described <i>ante,</i> at 1425-1426, New Jersey's Coastal Management Agency assured the Secretary of Commerce that \"`<i>any</i> New Jersey project extending beyond mean low water'\" (emphasis added) had to be approved by Delaware's Coastal Management Agency as well as New Jersey's. This again supports Delaware's theory of this case, but not the Court's.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1435</span> While post-Compact conduct provides no\u0097absolutely <i>zero</i>\u0097support for the Court's interpretation, it provides substantial support for the one I have suggested. In <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> a case before this Court involving precisely the meaning of the Compact, the Attorney General of Delaware (obviously authorized to present the State's position on the point) conceded to the Special Master that \"Article VII of the Compact is obviously merely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of New Jersey and a <i>cession</i> to the State of New Jersey by the State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those rights.\" 1 NJ App. 123a (emphasis added). And at oral argument before the Special Master, Delaware's Special Counsel\u0097Clarence A. Southerland, a former State Attorney General and future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Delaware, see Delaware Bar in the Twentieth Century 375 (H. Winslow, A. Bookout, &amp; P. Hannigan eds.1994)\u0097explained that \"the Compact of 1905 expressly acknowledged the rights of the citizens of New Jersey, at least, by implication to wharf out\" and that New Jersey possessed \"all the right <i>to control the erection of those wharves and to say who shall erect them.\"</i> 1 NJ App. 126a-1 (emphasis added). And in its Supreme Court brief in that litigation, Delaware assured the Court, without conditions, that \"Delaware has never questioned the right of citizens of New Jersey to wharf out <i>to navigable water</i> nor can such a right be questioned now because it is clearly protected by the Compact of 1905 between the States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 139a (emphasis added). Delaware's Supreme Court brief rejected New Jersey's argument that, if the Court found the boundary line to be the low-water mark on the New Jersey shore, \"the interests of the riparian owners will be either destroyed or seriously prejudiced.\" That concern, Delaware said, was misguided because the 1905 Compact \"recognized the rights of riparian owners in the river to wharf out.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 140a. \"The effect of Article VII of the Compact,\" the brief explained, \"was that the State of Delaware recognized the rights of the inhabitants on the east side of the river to wharf out to navigable water. This right had never been questioned and was undoubtedly inserted to put beyond question the <i>riparian rights</i> (as distinguished from <i>title)</i> of land owners in New Jersey.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 141a. These concessions are powerful indication that Delaware's understanding of the Compact was the same as the one I assert.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> 540 U.S. 56, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), effectively decided this case. It rejected the very same assertion of a riverbed-owning State's supervening police-power authority over constructions into the river from a State that had been conceded riparian rights. That case involved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1436</span> two governing documents rather than (as here) only one. The first, a 1785 compact, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`The citizens of each state respectively shall have full property in the shores of Potowmack river adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements, so as not to obstruct or injure the navigation of the river.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62, 124 S.Ct. 598.</blockquote>\n<p>The second, an arbitration award of 1877 that interpreted the earlier compact, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over the soil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership, without impeding the navigation or otherwise interfering with the proper use of it by Maryland, agreeably to the compact of seventeen hundred and eighty-five.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62-63, 124 S.Ct. 598.</blockquote>\n<p>We rejected Maryland's police-power authority to forbid Virginia's construction of a water intake structure that extended into Maryland territory, and held that \"Virginia's right `to erect . . . structures connected with the shore' is inseparable from, and `necessary to,' the `full enjoyment of her riparian ownership' of the soil to low-water mark.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598. Maryland, we observed, was \"doubtless correct that if her sovereignty over the River was well settled as of 1785, we would apply a strong presumption against reading the Compact as stripping her authority to regulate activities on the River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 598. But because the \"scope of Maryland's sovereignty over the River was in dispute both before and after the 1785 Compact,\" no such presumption existed. <i>Id.,</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. 598.</p>\n<p>Today's opinion, quoting the Special Master, claims that the result in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> turned on \"`the unique language of the compact and arbitration award involved in that case.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1424 (quoting Report 64, n. 118). But the case did not say that. And of course virtually every written agreement or award has \"unique language,\" so if we could only extend to other cases legal principles pertaining to identical language our interpretive jurisprudence would be limited indeed. The documents in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> said in other words precisely what the Compact here said: that one of the States (there, Virginia, here, New Jersey) was given riparian rights, including the right to construct wharves and improvements. And the holding of the case was that those rights could be exercised free of police power or other interference by the State owning the riverbed.</p>\n<p>The Court contends that in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> the arbitration award, rather than the compact, \"was definitive,\" because it recognized the right of Virginia \" <i>'qua</i> sovereign,'\" and nowhere made the right \"`subject to Maryland's regulatory authority.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1424 (quoting 540 U.S., at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598). But Article VII of the Compact here at issue likewise spoke of the rights of New Jersey <i>\"qua</i> sovereign\" (what else does the \"exercise [of] riparian <i>jurisdiction</i>\" mean?) and similarly did not make those rights subject to Delaware's regulatory authority. We stressed in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> that the salient factor in the interpretation of the compact (and hence in the arbitration award's interpretation of the compact) was that it was entered into (like the Compact here) by way of settlement of a continuing boundary dispute. \"If any inference at all is to be drawn from [the compact's] silence on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1437</span> the subject of regulatory authority,\" we said, \"it is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 598. <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> effectively decided this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Finally, I must remark at greater length upon the Court's peculiar limitation upon New Jersey's wharfing-out rights\u0097that it excludes wharves of \"extraordinary character.\" But for that limitation, the Court's conclusion is precisely the same as my own: \"Given the authority over riparian rights that the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey, Delaware may not impede ordinary and usual exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New Jersey's shore.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1427. The Court inexplicably concludes, however, that the liquefied natural gas (LNG) unloading wharf at stake in this litigation \"goes well beyond the ordinary or usual.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Why? Because it possesses \"extraordinary character.\"</p>\n<p>To our knowledge (and apparently to the Court's, judging by its failure to cite any authority) the phrase has never been mentioned before in any case involving limitations on wharfing out. What in the world does it mean? Would a pink wharf, or a zig-zagged wharf qualify? Today's opinion itself gives the phrase no content other than to say that \"Delaware's classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a `heavy industry use' and a `bulk product transfer facilit[y],' . . . has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This rationale is bizarre. There is no reason why <i>any</i> designation by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control would be relevant to, let alone controlling on, the meaning of the 1905 Compact; and no reason why New Jersey's authority under the 1905 Compact should turn on the state-law question whether Delaware \"rationally categorize[s]\" a wharf under its own statutes, <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21. Wharves were commonly used for \"heavy industry use\" when the 1905 Compact was adopted, and their primary commercial use was to transfer bulk cargoes. One roughly contemporaneous book on the design and building of wharves in America included information on appropriate pavement material to enable use of trucks on wharves, the proper method of laying down railroad tracks, and the construction of hatch cranes for unloading cargo. See C. Greene, Wharves and Piers: Their Design, Construction, and Equipment 191-194, 206-215 (1917). The Court gives no reason why the terminal's character as a \"heavy industry use\" and a \"bulk product transfer facilit[y]\" matters in the slightest. Indeed, the Court does not take its state-law reason for \"extraordinary character\" seriously, conceding that Delaware could not regulate an <i>identical</i> wharf for the \"bulk product transfer\" of \"tofu and bean sprouts,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21.</p>\n<p>Apart from the Delaware Department's \"heavy industry use\" and \"bulk product transfer\" designations, the Court cites, as support for its conclusion that this wharf is of \"extraordinary character\" its own factual background section describing the wharf. See <i>ante,</i> at 1427 (citing <i>ante,</i> at 1417-1418). It is not clear which, if any, of the facts discussed there the Court claims to be relevant, and I am forced to speculate on what they might be.</p>\n<p>Could it be the size of the wharf, which is 2,000 feet long, see <i>ante,</i> at 1418, and extends some 1,455 feet into Delaware territory, see Brief for BP America Inc. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 1-2? But the Court cites <i>not a single source</i> for this length limitation upon wharfing out. We did not intimate, in holding in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> that Virginia could authorize construction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1438</span> of a water intake pipe extending 725 feet from its shoreline into Maryland, see 540 U.S., at 63, 124 S.Ct. 598, that the result turned on the length of the pipe. As I have discussed, the common law <i>did</i> establish a size limitation for wharves: the wharf could not be extended so far as to interfere needlessly with the public's \"right of navigation\" in navigable waters. 1 Farnham \u00a7 111, at 521. Wharves constructed to access the water could \"project to a distance from the shore necessary to reach water which shall float vessels, <i>the largest as well as the smallest.\" Id.,</i> \u00a7 111, at 522 (emphasis added). Delaware has not claimed that the wharf in this case will interfere with navigation of the river, which is approximately one mile wide at this location, see Brief for BP America Inc. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2. And the record reveals that New Jersey, at least, anticipated that wharves on its side of the river could extend as far as the wharf in this case by establishing pierhead lines in 1877 and 1916 that extended <i>\"below</i> low water mark at distances varying from 378 to 3,550 feet.\" 1 NJ App. 135a; see also 3 <i>id.,</i> at 376a (affidavit of Richard G. Castagna). (Pierhead lines mark the permissible \"outshore limit of structures of any kind.\" Greene, <i>supra,</i> at 27.)</p>\n<p>Could the fact rendering this a wharf of \"extraordinary character\" be that its construction would require the dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards of soil within Delaware's territory? <i>Ante,</i> at 1418. This is suggested, perhaps, by the portion of the Decree which says that \"Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the . . . soil within the twelve-mile circle.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428; see also <i>ante,</i> at 1418, n. 8. But no again. Although the record contains no evidence of the dredge volumes required to construct the wharves on the river at the time of the Compact's adoption, it does show that an 1896 navigational improvement required the dredging of 35 million cubic yards from the Delaware River, and a 1907 dredging at Cape May Harbor, New Jersey, removed 19.7 million cubic yards. 7 NJ App. 1234a (affidavit of J. Richard Weggel). At the very least, the dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards \"would have been familiar to or ascertainable by individuals interested in riparian uses or structures at the time the Compact was signed or ratified.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1227a. I do not know what to make of the Court's response that the instances of dredging that I have cited involved \"public works.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1418, n. 8. Is that a limitation upon the Court's holding\u0097only <i>private</i> wharves of \"extraordinary character\" can be regulated by Delaware? But in fact dredging seems to have nothing to do with the issue, since (once again) the Court acknowledges that the same wharf for tofu and bean sprouts would be OK.</p>\n<p>Could the determinative fact be that the wharf would service \"[s]upertankers with capacities of up to 200,000 cubic meters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship then carrying natural gas),\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418; that these ships \"would pass densely populated areas\" and require establishment of \"a moving safety zone [that] would restrict other vessels 3,000 feet ahead and behind, and 1,500 feet on all sides,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418, n. 7? This is suggested, perhaps, by the portion of the Decree which says that \"Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river . . . within the twelve-mile circle.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428. But surely not. Whatever power Delaware has to restrict traffic on the waters of the United States (a question not presented by this case, though one that seems not to inhibit the Decree's blithe positing of state \"authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river,\" <i>ibid.),</i> it has no bearing on whether New <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1439</span> Jersey can build the <i>wharf</i> without Delaware's interference.</p>\n<p>Could the determinative fact be that the wharf will be used to transport liquefied natural gas, which is dangerous? No again. The Court cites no support, and I am aware of none, for the proposition that the common law forbade a wharf owner to load or unload hazardous goods. At the time of the Compact's adoption, congressional sources reported that the Delaware River was used to transport, among other items, coal tar and pitch, sulfur, gunpowder, and explosives. Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, H.R. Doc. No. 22, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., 1031-1033 (App.H) (1906) (tabulating commerce on the Delaware River by item in 1904 and 1905). Books published some time after the adoption of the Compact discuss the proper handling of seaborne \"dangerous goods,\" including liquids such as benzene, petroleum, and turpentine. See J. Aeby, Dangerous Goods (2d ed.1922); R. MacElwee &amp; T. Taylor, Wharf Management: Stevedoring and Storage 41, 221 (1921). There is not a shred of evidence that the parties to the Compact understood that New Jersey and Delaware would not be authorized to grant riparian rights for the loading and unloading of goods that are\u0097under some amorphous and unexplained criteria\u0097dangerous.</p>\n<p>I say that none of these factors has any bearing upon whether, at law, the wharfing out at issue here is anything more than the usual and ordinary exercise of a riparian right. I am not so rash as to suggest, however, that these factors had nothing to do with the Court's decision. After all, our environmentally sensitive Court concedes that if New Jersey had approved a wharf of equivalent dimensions, to accommodate tankers of equivalent size, carrying tofu and bean sprouts, Delaware could not have interfered. See <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>According to one study, construction activities on the LNG facility in this case would have created more than 1,300 new jobs, added $277 million to New Jersey's gross state product, and produced $13 million in state and local tax revenues. J. Seneca et al., Economic Impacts of BP's Proposed Crown Landing LNG Terminal 65, online at http://www.policy.rutgers.edu/news/reports/BPCrownLanding.pdf (as visited Mar. 28, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Operation of the facility was projected to generate 231 permanent jobs, and more than $88 million in state and local tax revenues over a 30-year period. <i>Ibid.</i> Its delivery capacity would represent 15 percent of the current consumption of natural gas in the region. <i>Id.,</i> at 66. In holding that Delaware may veto the project, the Court owes New Jersey\u0097not to mention an energy-starved Nation\u0097something more than its casual and unsupported statements that the wharf possesses \"extraordinary character\" and \"goes well beyond the ordinary or usual.\"</p>\n<p>Today's decision does not even have the excuse of achieving a desirable result. If one were to design, <i>ex ante,</i> the socially optimal allocation of the power to permit and forbid wharfing out, surely that power would be lodged with the sovereign that stands most to gain from the benefits of a wharf, and most to lose from its environmental and other costs. Unquestionably, that is the sovereign with jurisdiction over the land from which the wharf is extended. Delaware and New Jersey doubtless realized this when they agreed in 1905 that each of them would have jurisdiction over riparian rights on its own side of the river. The genius of today's decision is that it creates irrationality where sweet reason <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1440</span> once prevailed\u0097straining mightily, against all odds, to assure that the power to permit or forbid \"heavy industry use\" wharves in New Jersey shall rest with Delaware, which has no interest whatever in facilitating the delivery of goods to New Jersey, which has relatively little to lose from the dangerous nature of those goods or the frequency and manner of their delivery, and which may well have an interest in forcing the inefficient location of employment- and tax-producing wharves on its own shore. It makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Under its Decree, \"[t]he Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as it may from time to time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and effect to this Decree or to effectuate the rights of the parties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428. This could mean, I suppose, that we can anticipate a whole category of original actions in this Court that will clarify, wharf by wharf, what is a wharf of \"extraordinary character.\" (Who would have thought that such utterly indefinable and unpredictable complexity lay hidden within the words of the Compact?) More likely, however, prospective builders of \"heavy industry use\" wharves from the New Jersey shore\u0097of whatever size\u0097will apply to Delaware and simply go elsewhere if rejected.</p>\n<p>The wharf at issue in this litigation would have been viewed as an ordinary and usual riparian use at the time the two States entered into the 1905 Compact. Delaware accordingly may not prohibit its construction.

We find unconvincing New Jersey's contention that its officials were ignorant of the State's own statutes.

So is its reliance upon Article VIII of the Compact, <i>ante,</i> at 1420-1421, 1426-1427\u0097an argument so weak that it deserves only a footnote response. Article VIII provides that nothing in the Compact \"shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State. . . <i>except as herein expressly set forth.\"</i> 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). But New Jersey's riparian rights <i>are</i> expressly set forth, so the only question\u0097the one I have addressed above\u0097is what those rights consist of. But accepting the Court's over-reading of Article VIII (which presumably requires each of the riparian rights to be named one by one), it is utterly impossible to see why Article VIII is any more \"expres[s]\" in setting forth New Jersey's authority over wharves that lack \"extraordinary character\" than it is in setting forth her authority over wharves that possess it. Once again, the argument supports not the Court's holding, but rather Delaware's more expansive theory that it may regulate any and all wharves built from the Jersey shoreline. There is, to tell the truth, nothing whatever to support the Court's holding.</p>\n\n</div>",

DELAWARE\n\n  ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n\n No. 134, Orig. Argued November 27, 2007\u2014Decided March 31, 2008\nThis is the third original action between New Jersey and Delaware in-\n  volving the boundary along the Delaware River (or River) separating\n  the two States. The first action was settled by a compact the two\n  States approved in 1905, and Congress ratified in 1907 (1905 Com-\n  pact or Compact). See New Jersey v. Delaware, 205 U. S. 550 (New\n  Jersey v. Delaware I). The 1905 Compact addressed fishing rights\n  but did not define the interstate boundary line. Two provisions of the\n  Compact sowed the seeds for further litigation. Article VII provided:\n  \u201cEach State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise ri-\n  parian jurisdiction of every kind and nature.\u201d But Article VIII added:\n  \u201cNothing herein . . . shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or juris-\n  diction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the own-\n  ership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set\n  forth.\u201d The second action, resolved by this Court in 1934, conclu-\n  sively determined the location of the interstate boundary: Delaware\n  owned \u201cthe river and the subaqueous soil\u201d within a twelve-mile circle\n  centered on New Castle, Del., \u201cup to [the] low water mark on the\n  easterly or New Jersey side\u201d; south of the twelve-mile circle, the mid-\n  dle of the River\u2019s main ship channel marked the boundary. New Jer-\n  sey v. Delaware II, 291 U. S. 361, 385.\n    The current controversy was sparked by the Delaware Department\n  of Natural Resources and Environmental Control\u2019s (DNREC) refusal\n  to grant British Petroleum permission to construct a liquefied natu-\n  ral gas (LNG) unloading terminal projected to extend beyond New\n  Jersey\u2019s shore some 2,000 feet into Delaware territory. DNREC de-\n  termined that, under Delaware\u2019s Costal Zone Act (DCZA), the pro-\n  posed terminal would be an \u201coffshore bulk product transfer facilit[y]\u201d\n  as well as a \u201cheavy industry use,\u201d both prohibited by the Act. New\n  Jersey commenced this action, seeking a declaration that Article VII\n2                     NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of the 1905 Compact gave it exclusive regulatory authority over all\n    projects appurtenant to its shores, including wharves extending past\n    the low-water mark on New Jersey\u2019s side into Delaware territory.\n    Delaware\u2019s answer asserted that, under, inter alia, Article VIII of the\n    Compact and New Jersey v. Delaware II, it had regulatory authority,\n    undiminished by Article VII, over structures located within its bor-\n    ders. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Special Master\n    filed a report recommending a determination by this Court that the\n    \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d preserved to New Jersey by Article VII is not\n    exclusive and that Delaware has overlapping jurisdiction, within the\n    twelve-mile circle, to regulate improvements outshore of the low-\n    water mark on the New Jersey side of the River. New Jersey filed\n    exceptions.\nHeld: Article VII of the 1905 Compact did not secure to New Jersey\n exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian improvements commencing on\n its shores; New Jersey and Delaware have overlapping authority to\n regulate riparian structures and operations of extraordinary charac-\n ter extending outshore of New Jersey\u2019s domain into territory over\n which Delaware is sovereign. Pp. 8\u201323.\n    (a) The Court rejects New Jersey\u2019s argument that Article VII,\n which accords each State \u201criparian jurisdiction of every kind and na-\n ture,\u201d bars Delaware from any encroachment upon New Jersey\u2019s au-\n thority over improvements extending from New Jersey\u2019s shore.\n Pp. 8\u201316.\n      (1) The novel term \u201criparian jurisdiction,\u201d as used in Article VII,\n is properly read as a limiting modifier and does not mean \u201cexclusive\n jurisdiction.\u201d \u201c[R]iparian jurisdiction\u201d has never been a legal term of\n art, and appears to be a verbal formulation the 1905 Compact nego-\n tiators devised specifically for Article VII. Elsewhere in the 1905\n Compact\u2014most notably, in Article VIII\u2014the more familiar term \u201cju-\n risdiction\u201d or \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d appears. Attributing to \u201cripar-\n ian jurisdiction\u201d the same meaning as \u201cjurisdiction\u201d unmodified, or\n equating the novel term with the formulation \u201cexclusive jurisdiction,\u201d\n would deny operative effect to each word in the Compact. See United\n States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539. Presumably drafted in\n recognition of the still-unresolved boundary dispute, Article VIII re-\n quires an express statement in the Compact in order to \u201caffect the\n territorial . . . jurisdiction of either State . . . over the Delaware\n River.\u201d The Court resists reading the uncommon term \u201criparian ju-\n risdiction,\u201d even when aggrandized by the phrase \u201cof every kind and\n nature,\u201d as effectuating a transfer to New Jersey of Delaware\u2019s entire\n \u201cterritorial . . . jurisdiction . . . over [the portion of] the Delaware\n River [in question].\u201d Pp. 10\u201311.\n      (2) A riparian landowner ordinarily enjoys the right to build a\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

But that right, New Jersey agrees, is subject\nto state regulation for the protection of the public. New Jersey sees\nitself, however, as the only State empowered to regulate, for the\nbenefit of the public, New Jersey landowners\u2019 exercise of riparian\nrights. Commonly, the State that grants riparian rights also has\nregulatory authority over their exercise. But the 1905 Compact\u2019s ne-\ngotiators faced an unusual situation: As long as the boundary issue\nremained unsettled, they could not know which State was sovereign\nwithin the twelve-mile circle beyond New Jersey\u2019s shore. They likely\nknew, however, that \u201c[t]he rights of a riparian owner [seeking to\nwharf out into] a navigable stream . . . are governed by the law of the\nstate in which the stream is situated.\u201d Weems Steamboat Co. of Bal-\ntimore v. People\u2019s Steamboat Co., 214 U. S. 345, 355. With the sover-\neignty issue reserved by the 1905 Compact for another day, it is diffi-\ncult to gainsay the Special Master\u2019s conclusion that Article VII\u2019s\nreference to \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d did not mean \u201cexclusive jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d Endeavoring to harmonize Article VII with the boundary de-\ntermination, the Special Master concluded that Article VII\u2019s preser-\nvation to each State of \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d gave New Jersey\ncontrol of the riparian rights ordinarily and usually enjoyed by land-\nowners on New Jersey\u2019s shore. But once the boundary line at low wa-\nter is passed, the Special Master further concluded, New Jersey\u2019s\nregulatory authority is qualified. Just as New Jersey cannot grant\nland belonging to Delaware, New Jersey cannot authorize activities\nthat go beyond the exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights in\nthe face of contrary regulation by Delaware. Pp. 12\u201316.\n   (b) An 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York establish-\ning the two States\u2019 common Hudson River boundary casts informa-\ntive light on the 1905 New Jersey-Delaware Compact. Similar to the\nboundary settled in New Jersey v. Delaware II, the 1834 accord lo-\ncated the New Jersey-New York boundary at \u201cthe low water-mark on\nthe . . . New Jersey side [of the Hudson River,]\u201d 4 Stat. 710. Unlike\nthe 1905 Compact, however, the 1834 agreement expressly gave New\nJersey \u201cthe exclusive right of property in and to . . . land under water\u201d\nand \u201cthe exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and\nimprovements . . . on the shore of the said state . . . ,\u201d ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Comparable language is noticeably absent in Article VII of\nthe 1905 Compact, while other provisions of the Compact appear to\nhave been adopted almost verbatim from the 1834 New Jersey-New\nYork accord. New Jersey, therefore, could hardly claim ignorance\nthat Article VII could have been but was not drafted to grant it \u201cex-\nclusive jurisdiction\u201d (not merely \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d) over wharves\nand other improvements extending from its shore into navigable wa-\n4                      NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ters. Pp. 16\u201317.\n       (c) Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 75\u2014in which this Court\n    held that a Maryland-Virginia boundary settlement gave Virginia\n    \u201csovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to build im-\n    provements appurtenant to [Virginia\u2019s] shore and to withdraw water\n    from the [Potomac] River\u201d\u2014 provides scant support for New Jersey\u2019s\n    claim. As the Special Master explained, the result in Virginia v.\n    Maryland turned on the unique language of the 1785 compact and\n    1877 arbitration award there involved. The 1785 compact addressed\n    only \u201cthe right [of the citizens of each State] to build wharves and\n    improvements regardless of which State ultimately was determined\n    to be sovereign over the River,\u201d id., at 69. Concerning the States\n    themselves, the 1877 arbitration award that settled the boundary\n    was definitive. See id., at 75. By recognizing in that award Vir-\n    ginia\u2019s right, \u201cqua sovereign,\u201d \u201cto use the River beyond low-water\n    mark,\u201d id., at 72, the arbitrators manifested their intention to safe-\n    guard Virginia\u2019s authority to construct riparian improvements\n    outshore of the low-water mark free from regulation by Maryland.\n    By contrast, neither the 1905 Compact nor New Jersey v. Delaware II\n    purported to give New Jersey all regulatory oversight (as opposed to\n    only \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d). Pp. 17\u201319.\n       (d) Delaware\u2019s claim to regulatory authority is further supported by\n    New Jersey\u2019s acceptance (until the present controversy) of Delaware\u2019s\n    jurisdiction over water and land within its domain to preserve the\n    quality and prevent deterioration of its coastal areas. When New\n    Jersey sought federal approval for its coastal management program,\n    it made the representation\u2014fundamentally inconsistent with its po-\n    sition here\u2014that any New Jersey project extending beyond mean low\n    water within the twelve-mile circle would require coastal permits\n    from both States. The DNREC, with no objection from New Jersey,\n    had previously rejected as a prohibited bulk transfer facility an ear-\n    lier request to build a LNG terminal extending from New Jersey into\n    Delaware. The DNREC issued permits for each of the three struc-\n    tures extending from New Jersey into Delaware built between 1969\n    and 2006, one of them undertaken by New Jersey itself. Even during\n    the pendency of this action, New Jersey applied to Delaware for re-\n    newal of the permit covering the portion of New Jersey\u2019s project that\n    extended into Delaware. Pp. 19\u201322.\n       (e) Nowhere does Article VII \u201cexpressly set forth,\u201d in Article VIII\u2019s\n    words, Delaware\u2019s lack of any governing authority over territory\n    within the State\u2019s own borders. The Special Master correctly deter-\n    mined that Delaware\u2019s pre-1971 \u201chands off\u201d policy regarding coastal\n    development did not signal that the State never could or never would\n    assert any regulatory authority over structures using its subaqueous\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

In the decades since Delaware, pursuant to the DCZA, began to\n  manage its waters and submerged lands, the State has followed a\n  consistent course: Largely with New Jersey\u2019s cooperation, Delaware\n  has checked proposed structures and activity extending beyond New\n  Jersey\u2019s shore into Delaware\u2019s domain in order to protect the natural\n  environment of its coastal areas. Pp. 22\u201323.\n    (f) Given the authority over riparian rights preserved for New Jer-\n  sey by the 1905 Compact, Delaware may not impede ordinary and\n  usual exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New\n  Jersey\u2019s shore. The project British Petroleum sought to construct and\n  operate, however, goes well beyond the ordinary or usual. Delaware\u2019s\n  classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a \u201cheavy\n  industry use\u201d and a \u201cbulk product transfer facilit[y]\u201d under the DCZA\n  has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate. Consis-\n  tent with the scope of Delaware\u2019s retained police power to regulate\n  certain riparian uses, it was within that State\u2019s authority to prohibit\n  construction of the LNG facility. P. 23.\nDelaware\u2019s authority to deny British Petroleum permission to construct\n the proposed LNG terminal confirmed; New Jersey\u2019s exceptions over-\n ruled; and the Special Master\u2019s proposed decree entered with modifi-\n cations consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion.\n\n  GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

DELAWARE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate boundary at that time, the 1905 Compact contained\ntwo jurisdictional provisions important to the current\ndispute:\n      \u201cArt. VII. Each State may, on its own side of the\n    river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of\n    every kind and nature, and to make grants, leases,\n    and conveyances of riparian lands and rights under\n    the laws of the respective States.\n      \u201cArt. VIII. Nothing herein contained shall affect\n    the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either\n    State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the owner\u00ad\n    ship of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein\n    expressly set forth.\u201d Act of Jan. 24, 1907, 34 Stat.\n    860.\n   The controversy we here resolve was sparked by Dela\u00ad\nware\u2019s refusal to grant permission for construction of a\nliquefied natural gas (LNG) unloading terminal that\nwould extend some 2,000 feet from New Jersey\u2019s shore into\nterritory New Jersey v. Delaware II adjudged to belong to\nDelaware. The LNG plant, storage tanks, and other struc\u00ad\ntures would be maintained onshore in New Jersey. Rely\u00ad\ning on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, New Jersey urged\nthat it had exclusive jurisdiction over all projects appurte\u00ad\nnant to its shores, including wharves extending past the\nlow-water mark on New Jersey\u2019s side into Delaware terri\u00ad\ntory. Delaware asserted regulatory authority, undimin\u00ad\nished by Article VII, over structures located within its\nborders; in support, Delaware invoked, inter alia, Article\nVIII of the 1905 Compact and our decision in New Jersey\nv. Delaware II. The Special Master we appointed to super\u00ad\nintend the proceedings filed a report recommending a\ndetermination that Delaware has authority to regulate the\nproposed construction, concurrently with New Jersey, to\nthe extent that the project reached beyond New Jersey\u2019s\nborder and extended into Delaware\u2019s domain.\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Article VII of the 1905 Compact, we hold,\ndid not secure to New Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all\nriparian improvements commencing on its shores.2 The\nparties\u2019 own conduct, since the time Delaware has endeav\u00ad\nored to regulate coastal development, supports the conclu\u00ad\nsion to which other relevant factors point: New Jersey and\nDelaware have overlapping authority to regulate riparian\nstructures and operations of extraordinary character\nextending outshore of New Jersey\u2019s domain into territory\nover which Delaware is sovereign.\n                             I\n   Disputes between New Jersey and Delaware concerning\nthe boundary along the Delaware River (or River) separat\u00ad\ning the two States have persisted \u201calmost from the begin\u00ad\nning of statehood.\u201d New Jersey v. Delaware II, 291 U. S.,\nat 376. The history of the States\u2019 competing claims of\nsovereignty, rehearsed at length in New Jersey v. Dela-\nware II, need not be detailed here. In brief, tracing title\nthrough a series of deeds originating with a 1682 grant\nfrom the Duke of York to William Penn, Delaware as\u00ad\nserted dominion, within the twelve-mile circle, over the\nRiver and its subaqueous lands up to the low-water mark\non the New Jersey side. Id., at 364, 374.3 New Jersey\nclaimed sovereign ownership up to the middle of the navi\u00ad\ngable channel. Id., at 363\u2013364.\n   The instant proceeding is the third original action New\nJersey has commenced against Delaware involving the\nDelaware River boundary between the two States.

See Report of\nSpecial Master 3 (Report).4 That case \u201cslumbered for\nmany years.\u201d New Jersey v. Delaware II, 291 U.

Modest in\ncomparison to the parties\u2019 initial aim, the Compact left\nlocation of the interstate boundary an unsettled question.5\nNew Jersey then withdrew its complaint and this Court\ndismissed the case without prejudice. New Jersey v. Dela-\nware I, 205 U. S. 550 (1907).\n  The second original action, New Jersey v. Delaware II,\nwas fueled by a dispute over ownership of an oyster bed in\nthe River below the twelve-mile circle. See Report 14. In\nresponse to New Jersey\u2019s complaint, the Court conclu\u00ad\nsively settled the boundary between the States. Confirm\u00ad\ning the Special Master\u2019s report, the Court held that,\nwithin the twelve-mile circle, Delaware owns the River\nand the subaqueous soil up to the low-water mark on the\nNew Jersey side. 291 U.

See\nalso New Jersey v. Delaware II, 295 U. S. 694, 699 (1935)\n(Decree) (perpetually enjoining the States from further\ndisputing the boundary).\n   In upholding Delaware\u2019s title to the area within the\ntwelve-mile circle, the Court rejected an argument pressed\nby New Jersey based on the 1905 Compact: By agreeing to\nthe Compact, New Jersey urged, Delaware had abandoned\nany claim of ownership beyond the middle of the River.\nThe Court found New Jersey\u2019s argument \u201cwholly without\nforce.\u201d 291 U.

Beyond that\nit does not go.\u201d Id., at 377\u2013378. The Court next recited in\nfull the text of Article VIII of the Compact: \u201cNothing\nherein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights,\nor jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware\nRiver, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof,\nexcept as herein expressly set forth.\u201d Id., at 378 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n                             II\n  The current controversy arose out of the planned con\u00ad\nstruction of facilities to import, store, and vaporize for\u00ad\neign-source LNG; the proposed project would be operated\nby Crown Landing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of\nBritish Petroleum (BP). See Report 19; 6 App. of Dela\u00ad\nware on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment 3793,\n3804\u20133807 (hereinafter Del. App.) (Request for Coastal\nZone Status Decision).

DELAWARE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould include a gasification plant, storage tanks, and\nother structures onshore in New Jersey, and a pier and\nrelated structures extending some 2,000 feet from New\nJersey\u2019s shore into Delaware. Report 19\u201320; 6 Del. App.\n3804. Supertankers with capacities of up to 200,000 cubic\nmeters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship then\ncarrying natural gas) would berth at the pier. Id., at\n3810.7 A multipart transfer system\u2014including, inter alia,\ncryogenic piping, a containment trough, and utility lines\u2014\nwould be installed on the 6,000-square-foot unloading\nplatform and along the pier to transport the LNG (at\nsufficiently cold temperatures to keep it in a liquid state)\nfrom ships to three 158,000-cubic-meter storage tanks\nonshore; vapor byproducts resulting from the onshore\ngasification would be returned to the tankers.

We\ngranted leave to file a bill of complaint. 546 U. S. 1028\n(2005).

He ultimately\ndetermined that the \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d preserved to\nNew Jersey by Article VII of the 1905 Compact \u201cis not\nexclusive\u201d and that Delaware \u201chas overlapping jurisdiction\nto regulate . . . improvements outshore of the low water\nmark on the New Jersey side of the River.\u201d Id., at 32.\nNew Jersey filed exceptions to which we now turn.12\n                             III\n  At the outset, we summarize our decision and the prin\u00ad\ncipal reasons for it. In accord with the Special Master, we\nhold that Article VII of the 1905 Compact does not grant\nNew Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian im\u00ad\nprovements extending outshore of the low-water mark.\nFirst, the novel term \u201criparian jurisdiction,\u201d which the\nparties employed in the Compact, is properly read as a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 New Jersey takes no exception to the Special Master\u2019s determina\u00ad\n\ntions that Delaware was not judicially estopped from challenging New\nJersey\u2019s interpretation of Article VII, Report 86\u201392, and that Delaware\nhas not lost jurisdiction through prescription and acquiescence, id., at\n92\u201399. See Exceptions by New Jersey to Report of Special Master and\nSupporting Brief 16, n. 5 (hereinafter New Jersey Exceptions).\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlimiting modifier and not as synonymous with \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction.\u201d Second, an 1834 compact between New\nJersey and New York casts informative light on the later\nNew Jersey-Delaware accord. Third, our decision in Vir-\nginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56 (2003), provides scant\nsupport for New Jersey\u2019s claim. We there held that a\nMaryland-Virginia boundary settlement gave Virginia\n\u201csovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to\nbuild improvements appurtenant to [Virginia\u2019s] shore and\nto withdraw water from the [Potomac] River.\u201d Id., at 75.\nDelaware\u2019s 1905 agreement to New Jersey\u2019s exercise of\n\u201criparian jurisdiction,\u201d made when the boundary was still\ndisputed, cannot plausibly be read as an equivalent recog\u00ad\nnition of New Jersey\u2019s sovereign authority. Finally, Dela\u00ad\nware\u2019s claim to regulating authority is supported by New\nJersey\u2019s acceptance (until the present controversy) of\nDelaware\u2019s jurisdiction over water and land within its\ndomain to preserve the quality and prevent deterioration\nof the State\u2019s coastal areas.\n                              A\n   New Jersey hinges its case on Article VII of the 1905\nCompact, which it reads as conferring on \u201ceach State\ncomplete regulatory authority over the construction and\noperation of riparian improvements on its shores, even if\nthe improvements extend past the low-water mark.\u201d\nExceptions by New Jersey to Report of Special Master and\nSupporting Brief 16 (hereinafter New Jersey Exceptions).\nNew Jersey v. Delaware II, New Jersey recognizes, con\u00ad\nfirmed Delaware\u2019s sovereign ownership of the River and\nsubaqueous soil within the twelve-mile circle. But, New\nJersey emphasizes, the Court expressly made that deter\u00ad\nmination \u201csubject to the Compact of 1905.\u201d 291 U. S.,\nat 385. New Jersey acknowledges that Delaware \u201cunques\u00ad\ntionably can exercise its police power outshore of the low-\nwater mark.\u201d New Jersey Exceptions 16. New Jersey\n10                  NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncontends, however, that Delaware cannot do so in a man\u00ad\nner that would interfere with the authority over riparian\nrights that Article VII of the 1905 Compact preserves for\nNew Jersey. Ibid.\n   Because the meaning of the 1905 Compact and, in par\u00ad\nticular, Article VII, is key to the resolution of this contro\u00ad\nversy, we focus our attention on that issue. Significantly,\nArticle VII provides that \u201c[e]ach State may, on its own side\nof the river, continue to exercise\u201d not \u201cexclusive jurisdic\u00ad\ntion\u201d or \u201cjurisdiction\u201d unmodified, but \u201criparian jurisdic\u00ad\ntion of every kind and nature \u201d 34 Stat. 860. New Jersey\nargues that \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d should be read broadly\nto encompass full police-power jurisdiction over activities\ncarried out on riparian structures. New Jersey Exceptions\n36\u201337. If New Jersey enjoys full police power over im\u00ad\nprovements extending from its shore, New Jersey reasons,\nthen necessarily Delaware cannot encroach on that au\u00ad\nthority. See Report 54.\n                               1\n  We agree with the Special Master that \u201c \u2018riparian\u2019 is a\nlimiting modifier.\u201d Report 57. Interpreting an interstate\ncompact, \u201c[j]ust as if [we] were addressing a federal stat\u00ad\nute,\u201d New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998), it\nwould be appropriate to construe a compact term in accord\nwith its common-law meaning, see Morissette v. United\nStates, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952). The term \u201criparian\njurisdiction,\u201d however, was not a legal term of art in 1905,\nnor is it one now. See 7 Del. App. 4281 (Expert Report of\nProfessor Joseph L. Sax (Nov. 7, 2006)). As the Special\nMaster stated, \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d appears to be a\nverbal formulation \u201cdevised by the [1905 Compact] draft\u00ad\ners specifically for Article VII.\u201d Report 54.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The term appears in no other interstate compact.

Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539\n(1955).\n  In this regard, Article VIII bears reiteration:\n     \u201cNothing herein contained shall affect the territorial\n     limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or\n     over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the\n     subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set\n     forth.\u201d 34 Stat. 860.\nPresumably drafted in recognition of the still-unresolved\nboundary dispute, see supra, at 3\u20135, Article VIII requires\nan express statement in the Compact in order to \u201caffect\nthe territorial . . . jurisdiction of either State . . . over the\nDelaware River.\u201d We resist reading the uncommon term\n\u201criparian jurisdiction,\u201d even when aggrandized by the\nphrase \u201cof every kind and nature,\u201d as tantamount to an\nexpress cession by Delaware of its entire \u201cterritorial . . .\njurisdiction . . . over the Delaware River.\u201d\n                              2\n   Endeavoring to fathom the import of the novel term\n\u201criparian jurisdiction,\u201d the Special Master recognized that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate statute that does so.\n  14 The last paragraph of Article IV reads: \u201cEach State shall have and\n\nexercise exclusive jurisdiction within said river to arrest, try, and\npunish its own inhabitants for violation of the concurrent legislation\nrelated to fishery herein provided for.\u201d 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added).\nSee also id., at 859 (Articles I and II, recognizing the \u201cexclusive juris\u00ad\ndiction\u201d of each State in regard to service of criminal process).\n12               NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na riparian landowner ordinarily enjoys the right to build a\nwharf to access navigable waters far enough to permit the\nloading and unloading of ships. Report 47\u201349, 58\u201359.\nAccord 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights\n\u00a762, p. 279 (1904) (\u201cThe riparian owner is also entitled to\nhave his contact with the water remain intact. This is\nwhat is known as the right of access, and includes the\nright to erect wharves to reach the navigable portion of the\nstream.\u201d); id., \u00a7111, p. 520 (\u201cA wharf is a structure on the\nmargin of navigable water, alongside of which vessels are\nbrought for the sake of being conveniently loaded or\nunloaded.\u201d). But the Special Master also recognized that\nthe right of a riparian owner to wharf out is subject to\nstate regulation. Report 58; see 1 Farnham, supra, \u00a763, p.\n284 (rights of riparian owner \u201care always subordinate to\nthe public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise\nin the interest of the public\u201d); Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.\n1, 40 (1894) (\u201c[A] riparian proprietor . . . has the right of\naccess to the navigable part of the stream in front of his\nland, and to construct a wharf or pier projecting into the\nstream . . . , subject to such general rules and regulations\nas the legislature may prescribe for the protection of the\npublic . . . .\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  New Jersey took no issue with the Special Master\u2019s\nrecognition that States, in the public interest, may place\nrestrictions on a riparian proprietor\u2019s activities. In its\nresponse to Delaware\u2019s request for admissions, New Jer\u00ad\nsey readily acknowledged that a person wishing to conduct\na particular activity on a wharf, in addition to obtaining a\nriparian grant, would have to comply with all other \u201cappli\u00ad\ncable New Jersey laws, and local laws.\u201d 6 Del. App. 4156\n(New Jersey\u2019s Responses to Delaware\u2019s First Request for\nAdmissions \u00b622 (Sept. 8, 2006)).

But New Jersey sees itself, to the exclusion of\nDelaware, as the State empowered to regulate, for the\nbenefit of the public, New Jersey landowners\u2019 exercise of\nriparian rights.\n   In the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian\nrights is also the State that has regulatory authority over\nthe exercise of those rights. But cf. Cummings v. Chicago,\n188 U. S. 410, 431 (1903) (federal regulation of wharfing\nout in the Calumet River did not divest local government\nof regulatory authority based on location of project within\nthat government\u2019s territory). In this regard, the negotia\u00ad\ntors of the 1905 Compact faced an unusual situation: As\nlong as the boundary issue remained unsettled, they could\nnot know which State was sovereign within the twelve-\nmile circle beyond New Jersey\u2019s shore. They likely knew,\nhowever, that \u201c[i]n a case of wharfing out . . . \u2018[t]he rights\nof a riparian owner upon a navigable stream in this coun\u00ad\ntry are governed by the law of the state in which the\nstream is situated.\u2019 \u201d 1 S. Wiel, Water Rights in the West\u00ad\nern States \u00a7898, p. 934 (3d ed. 1911) (quoting Weems\nSteamboat Co. of Baltimore v. People\u2019s Steamboat Co., 214\nU. S. 345, 355 (1909)). With the issue of sovereignty re\u00ad\nserved by the 1905 Compact drafters for another day, the\nSpecial Master\u2019s conclusion that Article VII\u2019s reference to\n\u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d did not mean \u201cexclusive jurisdic\u00ad\ntion\u201d is difficult to gainsay.\n   The Special Master pertinently observed that, as New\nJersey read the 1905 Compact, Delaware had given up all\ngoverning authority over the disputed area while receiving\nnothing in return. He found New Jersey\u2019s position \u201cim\u00ad\nplausible.\u201d Report 63. \u201cDelaware,\u201d the Special Master\nstated, \u201cwould not have willingly ceded all jurisdiction\nover matters taking place on land that [Delaware ada\u00ad\nmantly] contended it owned exclusively and outright.\u201d Id.,\n14                   NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat 64.15\n  New Jersey asserts that Delaware did just that, as\nshown by representations made during proceedings in\nNew Jersey v. Delaware II. New Jersey Exceptions 44.\nDelaware\u2019s reply brief before the Special Master in that\ncase stated: \u201cArticle VII of the Compact is obviously\nmerely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of\nNew Jersey and a cession to the State of New Jersey by\nthe State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those\nrights.\u201d 1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary\nJudgment 123a. Further, at oral argument before the\nSpecial Master in that earlier fray, Delaware\u2019s counsel\nsaid that, in his view, the 1905 Compact \u201cceded to the\nState of New Jersey all the right to control the erection of\n[wharves extending into the Delaware River from New\nJersey\u2019s shore] and to say who shall erect them.\u201d Id., at\n126a\u20131.\n  The Special Master in the instant case found New Jer\u00ad\nsey\u2019s position dubious, as do we. The representations\nDelaware made in the course of New Jersey v. Delaware II,\nthe Special Master here observed, were \u201cfully consistent\nwith [the Master\u2019s] interpretation of Article VII [of the\n1905 Compact].\u201d Report 89. New Jersey did indeed pre\u00ad\nserve \u201cthe right to exercise its own jurisdiction over ripar\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The dissent insists that Delaware received \u201cplenty in return.\u201d Post,\n\nat 3. But, in truth, the 1905 Compact gave neither State \u201cplenty.\u201d\nEach State accommodated to the other to assure equal access to fishing\nrights in the River. See supra, at 4, n. 5. Delaware agreed to the\nCompact \u201cnot [as] a settlement of the disputed boundary, but [as] a\ntruce or modus vivendi.\u201d 1 Del. App. 190. In deciding whether to\nproceed with the litigation, Delaware\u2019s Attorney General advised that\nthe suit \u201cwould entail very considerable expense.\u201d 2 id., at 1075 (Jan.\n31, 1903 letter of Herbert Ward). He noted, however, that the process\nof preparing Delaware\u2019s Answer had \u201cgreatly strengthened the belief\nand reliance of counsel . . . upon the justice of her claim.\u201d Id., at 1076.\nThe decision in New Jersey v. Delaware II confirmed Delaware\u2019s convic\u00ad\ntion. See supra, at 4\u20135, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

But,\ncritically, Delaware nowhere \u201csuggested that New Jersey\nwould have the exclusive authority to regulate all aspects\nof riparian improvements, even if on Delaware\u2019s land.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Delaware, in its argument before the Special Master,\nwas equally uncompromising. As a result of the 1934\nboundary determination, Delaware urged, \u201cthe entire\nRiver is on Delaware\u2019s \u2018own side,\u2019 and New Jersey conse\u00ad\nquently ha[d] no \u2018side\u2019 of the River on which to exercise\nany riparian rights or riparian jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 36.\nArticle VII of the 1905 Compact, according to Delaware,\nwas a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure, \u201centirely . . . contingent on\nthe ultimate resolution of the boundary.\u201d Id., at 39. That\nreading, the Special Master demonstrated, was altogether\nfallacious. Id., at 36\u201340.\n   Seeking to harmonize Article VII with the boundary\ndetermination, the Special Master reached these conclu\u00ad\nsions. First, the 1905 Compact gave New Jersey no au\u00ad\nthority to grant lands owned by Delaware. Id., at 45\u201346.\nSecond, Article VII\u2019s preservation to each State of \u201cripar\u00ad\nian jurisdiction\u201d means that New Jersey may control the\nriparian rights ordinarily and usually enjoyed by land\u00ad\nowners on New Jersey\u2019s shore. For example, New Jersey\nmay define \u201chow far a riparian owner can wharf out, the\nquantities of water that a riparian owner can draw from\nthe River, and the like.\u201d Id., at 57\u201358. Nevertheless, New\nJersey\u2019s regulatory authority is qualified once the bound\u00ad\nary line at low water is passed. Id., at 58. Just as New\nJersey cannot grant land belonging to Delaware, so New\nJersey cannot authorize activities that go beyond the\nexercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights in the face\nof contrary regulation by Delaware.\n                            B\n  Interstate compacts, like treaties, are presumed to be\n16               NEW JERSEY v.

Thompson, 223 U. S. 317, 332 (1912). Accordingly, the\nSpecial Master found informative a comparison of lan\u00ad\nguage in the 1905 Compact with language contained in an\n1834 compact between New Jersey and New York. See\nReport 65. That compact established the two States\u2019\ncommon boundary along the Hudson River. Act of June\n28, 1834, ch. 126, 4 Stat. 708. Similar to the boundary\nbetween New Jersey and Delaware settled in 1934 in New\nJersey v. Delaware II, the 1834 accord located the New\nJersey-New York boundary at \u201cthe low water-mark on the\nwesterly or New Jersey side [of the Hudson River].\u201d Art.\nThird, 4 Stat. 710; cf. supra, at 1. The 1834 agreement,\nhowever, expressly gave to New Jersey \u201cthe exclusive right\nof property in and to the land under water lying west of\nthe middle of the bay of New York, and west of the middle\nof that part of the Hudson river which lies between Man\u00ad\nhattan island and New Jersey\u201d and \u201cthe exclusive jurisdic-\ntion of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements,\nmade and to be made on the shore of the said state . . .\u201d\nArt. Third, \u00a7\u00a71, 2, 4 Stat. 710 (emphasis added).\n   \u201cComparable language [conferring exclusive authority],\u201d\nthe Special Master observed, \u201cis noticeably absent in the\n[1905] Compact.\u201d Report 66. The Master found this dis\u00ad\nparity \u201cconspicuous,\u201d id., at 68, for \u201c[s]everal provisions in\nthe two interstate compacts [contain] strikingly similar\nlanguage,\u201d id., at 66; see id., App. J (Table Comparing\nSimilar Provisions in the New Jersey-New York Compact\nof 1834 and the New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905).\nGiven that provisions of the 1905 Compact appear to have\nbeen adopted almost verbatim from New Jersey\u2019s 1834\naccord with New York, see ibid., New Jersey could hardly\nclaim ignorance that Article VII could have been drafted to\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngrant New Jersey \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d (not merely\n\u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d) over wharves and other improve\u00ad\nments extending from its shore into navigable Delaware\nRiver waters. Id., at 67.16\n                              C\n   New Jersey urged before the Special Master, and in its\nexceptions to his report, that Virginia v. Maryland, 540\nU. S. 56, is dispositive of this case.17 Both cases involved\nan interstate compact, which left the boundary between\nthe contending States unresolved, and a later determina\u00ad\ntion settling the boundary. And both original actions were\nreferred to Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr., as Special Master. We\nfind persuasive the Special Master\u2019s reconciliation of his\nrecommendations in the two actions. See Report 64\u201365,\nn. 118.\n   Virginia v. Maryland involved a 1785 compact and an\n1877 arbitration award. Agreeing with the Special Mas\u00ad\nter, we held that the arbitration award permitted Virginia\nto construct a water intake structure extending into the\nPotomac River, even though the award placed Virginia\u2019s\nboundary at the low-water mark on its own side of the\nPotomac. See 540 U. S., at 75. \u201cSuperficially,\u201d the Special\nMaster said, \u201cthat holding would appear to support New\nJersey\u2019s argument here, i.e., that construction of wharves\noff New Jersey\u2019s shore should not be subject to regulation\nby Delaware.\u201d Report 64, n. 118. But, the Special Master\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 The 1834 accord was the subject of significant litigation in the\n\nyears leading up to and surrounding the adoption of the 1905 Compact.\nReport 67. Notably, New York\u2019s highest court concluded Article Third\nof the 1834 interstate agreement meant what it said: New Jersey had\n\u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over wharves extending from and beyond its\nshore; therefore New York lacked authority to declare those wharves to\nbe nuisances. See New York v. Central R. Co. of N. J., 42 N. Y. 283, 293\n(1870); Report 67.\n  17 The dissent, post, at 11\u201313, essentially repeats New Jersey\u2019s\n\nargument.\n18               NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained, the result in Virginia v. Maryland turned on\n\u201cthe unique language of the compact and arbitration\naward involved in that case.\u201d Ibid.\n  The key provision of the 1785 compact between Mary\u00ad\nland and Virginia, we observed, addressed only \u201cthe right\n[of the citizens of each State] to build wharves and im\u00ad\nprovements regardless of which State ultimately was\ndetermined to be sovereign over the River.\u201d 540 U. S.,\nat 69. Concerning the rights of the States, the 1877 arbi\u00ad\ntration award, not the 1785 compact, was definitive. See\nid., at 75. The key provision of that award recognized the\nright of Virginia, \u201cqua sovereign,\u201d \u201cto use the River beyond\nlow-water mark,\u201d a right \u201cnowhere made subject to Mary\u00ad\nland\u2019s regulatory authority.\u201d Id., at 72.\n  Confirming the \u201csovereign character\u201d of Virginia\u2019s right,\nwe noted, Maryland had proposed to the arbitrators that\nthe boundary line between the States be drawn around\n\u201call wharves and other improvements now extending or\nwhich may hereafter be extended, by authority of Virginia\nfrom the Virginia shore into the [Potomac] beyond low\nwater mark.\u201d Ibid., n. 7 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). Although the formulation Maryland proposed was\nnot used in the arbitration award, the arbitrators plainly\nmanifested their intention to accomplish the same end: to\nsafeguard \u201cVirginia\u2019s authority to construct riparian im\u00ad\nprovements outshore of the low water mark without regu\u00ad\nlation by Maryland.\u201d Report 65, n. 118; see Virginia v.\nMaryland, 540 U. S., at 73, n. 7. By contrast, in the in\u00ad\nstant case, neither the 1905 Compact, nor New Jersey v.\nDelaware II, the 1934 decision settling the boundary\ndispute, purported to give New Jersey \u201call regulatory\noversight (as opposed to merely riparian oversight)\u201d or to\nendow New Jersey with authority \u201cexclusive of jurisdiction\nby Delaware.\u201d Report 65, n. 118; see supra, at 10\u201315.\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

O\u2019Connor v. United States, 479 U. S.\n27, 33 (1986) (\u201cThe course of conduct of parties to an in\u00ad\nternational agreement, like the course of conduct of par\u00ad\nties to any contract, is evidence of its meaning.\u201d).\n   Until the 1960\u2019s, wharfing out from the New Jersey\nshore into Delaware territory was not a matter of contro\u00ad\nversy between the two States. From 1851, when New\nJersey began issuing grants for such activity, through\n1969, only 11 constructions straddled the interstate\nboundary. Report 74. At the time of the 1905 Compact\nand continuing into the 1950\u2019s, Delaware, unlike New\nJersey, issued no grants or leases for its subaqueous lands.\nDelaware regulated riparian improvements solely under\nits common law, which limited developments only to the\nextent they constituted public nuisances. Id., at 69.\n   In 1961, Delaware enacted its first statute regulating\nsubmerged lands, and in 1966, it enacted broader legisla\u00ad\ntion governing leases of state-owned subaqueous lands.\nId., at 70. The State grandfathered piers and wharves\nbuilt prior to the effective date of the regulations imple\u00ad\nmenting the 1966 statute. Id., at 70\u201371. Permits were\nrequired, however, for modifications to the grandfathered\nstructures and for new structures.

App. 3483 (Letter from David\nKeifer, Director of Delaware State Planning Office, to\nBarry Huntsinger, El Paso Eastern Company (Feb. 23,\n1972)). Shortly before denying El Paso\u2019s application,\nDelaware notified New Jersey\u2019s Department of Environ\u00ad\nmental Protection (NJDEP), which raised no objection to\nDelaware\u2019s refusal to permit the LNG terminal.19 Dela\u00ad\nware similarly relied on the DCZA to deny permits for\nconstruction of the Crown Landing unloading facility at\nissue in this case.

In my view, the construction\nand maintenance of wharves and other riparian improve\u00ad\nments that extend into territory over which Delaware is\nsovereign may only be authorized by New Jersey to the\nextent that such activities are not inconsistent with Dela\u00ad\nware\u2019s exercise of its police power. I therefore join para\u00ad\ngraphs 1(c), 2, 3, and 4 of the Court\u2019s decree, and write\nseparately to explain that in my view, New Jersey\u2019s au\u00ad\nthority to regulate beyond the low-water mark on its shore\nis subordinate to the paramount authority of the sovereign\nowner of the river, Delaware.\n                              I\n   At common law, owners of land abutting bodies of water\nenjoyed certain rights by virtue of their adjacency to that\nwater.

See also 4 Re\u00ad\nstatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7856, Comment e (1977) (\u201c[A]\nstate may exercise its police power by controlling the\ninitiation and conduct of riparian and nonriparian uses of\nwater\u201d).1\n   From these authorities it is clear that the rights of\nriparian landowners are ordinarily subject to regulation\nby some State. The only relevant question, then, for pur\u00ad\nposes of this case, is which State. As the Court notes, \u201c[i]n\nthe ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is\nalso the State that has regulatory authority over the\nexercise of those rights,\u201d ante, at 13. But the history of the\nrelationship between these two States vis-\u00e0-vis their\njointly bounded river takes this case out of the ordinary.\nIn light of the 1905 Compact, our previous decision in New\nJersey v. Delaware, 291 U. S. 361 (1934), and the States\u2019\ncourse of conduct, I agree with the Court\u2019s sensible conclu\u00ad\nsion that within the twelve-mile circle, the two States\u2019\nauthority over riparian improvements is to some extent\noverlapping. In my judgment, however, that overlapping\nauthority does not extend merely to the regulation of\n\u201criparian structures and operations of extraordinary char\u00ad\nacter\u201d beyond the low-water mark on New Jersey\u2019s shore,\nante, at 3, but to all riparian structures and operations\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 See also Weber v.

I\nwould hold, therefore, that New Jersey may only grant,\nand thereafter exercise governing authority over, the\nrights of construction, maintenance, and use of wharves\nand other riparian improvements beyond the low-water\nmark to the extent that the grant and exercise of those\nrights is not inconsistent with the police power of the\nState of Delaware.\n                              II\n  In Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 80 (2003), I set\nforth my view that the rights enjoyed by riparian land\u00ad\nowners along the Virginia shore of the Potomac River were\nsubject to regulation by the owner of the river, Maryland.\nI there explained that \u201cth[e] landowners\u2019 riparian rights\nare\u2014like all riparian rights at common law\u2014subject to\nthe paramount regulatory authority of the sovereign that\nowns the river, [Maryland],\u201d id., at 82 (dissenting opinion).\nI would have held, therefore, that it was within Mary\u00ad\nland\u2019s power to prevent the construction of the water\nintake facility that Fairfax County, Virginia, wished to\nbuild. A fortiori, then\u2014putting to one side the distinctions\nthe Court today draws between the two cases, ante, at 17\u2013\n18\u2014Delaware possesses the authority, under its laws, to\nrestrict the construction of the proposed liquified natural\ngas facility that would extend hundreds of feet into its\nsovereign territory.\n  But inherent in the notion of concurrency are limits to\nthe authority of even the sovereign that owns the river. In\nVirginia v. Maryland, supra, I noted that the case did not\nrequire the Court to \u201cdetermine the precise extent or\ncharacter of Maryland\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction,\u201d because\nthe issue presented was merely \u201cwhether Maryland may\nimpose any limits on . . . Virginia landowners whose prop\u00ad\nerty happens to abut the Potomac.\u201d Id., at 82 (dissenting\nopinion). Similarly, in this case we need not definitively\n4                   NEW JERSEY v.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 49, 50. Similarly, Dela\u00ad\nware should not be permitted to treat differently riparian\nimprovements extending outshore from New Jersey\u2019s land\nand those commencing on Delaware\u2019s own soil, absent\nsome reasonable police-power purpose for that differential\ntreatment. Apart from those clear constraints, however\u2014\nand subject to applicable federal law2\u2014in my view it is\nDelaware that possesses the primary authority over ripar\u00ad\nian improvements extending into its territory.\n                              III\n   Despite my differing views set forth herein, I do agree\nwith the conclusion that Delaware may prohibit construc\u00ad\ntion of the facility that spawned this complaint, and there\u00ad\nfore join the portion of the Court\u2019s decree so finding.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 See\n        4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7856, Comment e (1977) (\u201cThe\nUnited States may prohibit, limit and regulate the diversion, obstruc\u00ad\ntion or use of navigable waters . . . if those acts affect the navigable\ncapacity of navigable waters\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905\n(Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, ad-\ndressed the \u201cexercise [of] riparian jurisdiction,\u201d and the\npower to \u201cmake grants . . . of riparian . . . rights.\u201d The\nparticular riparian right at issue here is the right of\nwharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power\nover that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the\nDelaware River. The Court says, however, that that\njurisdiction and power was not exclusive. I find that\ndifficult to accept, because if Delaware could forbid the\nwharfing out that Article VII allowed New Jersey to per-\nmit, Article VII was a ridiculous nullity. That could not be\nwhat was meant. The Court seeks to avoid that obstacle\nto credibility by saying that Delaware\u2019s jurisdiction and\npower is limited to forbidding \u201cactivities that go beyond\nthe exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights.\u201d Ante,\nat 15. It is only \u201criparian structures and operations of\nextraordinary character\u201d over which Delaware retains\n\u201coverlapping authority to regulate.\u201d Ante, at 3 (emphasis\nadded). But that also is difficult to accept, because the\nCourt explains neither the meaning nor the provenance of\nits \u201cextraordinary character\u201d test. The exception (what-\never it means) has absolutely no basis in prior law, which\n2                NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nregards as beyond the \u201cordinary and usual\u201d (and hence\nbeyond the legitimate) only that wharfing out which inter-\nferes with navigation. So unheard-of is the exception that\nits first appearance in this case is in the Court\u2019s opinion.\n   I would sustain New Jersey\u2019s objections to the Special\nMaster\u2019s Report.\n                              I\n   I must begin by clearing some underbrush. One of\nDelaware\u2019s principal arguments\u2014an argument accepted\nby the Master and implicitly accepted by the Court\u2014is\nthat the 1905 Compact must not be construed to limit\nDelaware\u2019s pre-Compact (albeit at the time unrecognized)\nsovereign control over the Delaware River, because of the\n\u201cstrong presumption against defeat of a State\u2019s title\u201d in\ninterpreting agreements. See Report of Special Master\n42\u201343 (Report) (quoting United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S.\n1, 34 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accord-\ning to Delaware, this presumption establishes that the\n1905 Compact gave New Jersey the authority to allocate\nriparian rights, but left with Delaware the power to veto\nexercises of those rights under its general police-power\nauthority.\n   I have written of this presumption elsewhere that it\n\u201chas little if any independent legal force beyond what\nwould be dictated by normal principles of contract inter-\npretation. It is simply a rule of presumed (or implied-in-\nfact) intent.\u201d United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U. S.\n839, 920 (1996) (opinion concurring in judgment). It is a\nmanifestation of the commonsense intuition that a State\nwill rarely contract away its sovereign power. That intui-\ntion is sound enough in almost all state dealings with\nprivate citizens, and in some state dealings with other\nStates. It has no application here, however, because the\nwhole purpose of the 1905 Compact was precisely to come\nto a compromise agreement on the exercise of the two\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Entered into at a time when\nDelaware and New Jersey disputed the location of their\nboundary, the Compact demarcated the authority between\nthe two States with respect to service of civil and criminal\nprocess on vessels, rights of fishery, and riparian rights on\neither side of the Delaware River within the circle of a 12-\nmile radius centered on the town of New Castle, Delaware.\nSee Compact, 34 Stat. 858; New Jersey v. Delaware, 291\nU. S. 361, 377\u2013378 (1934) (New Jersey v. Delaware II).\nThere is no way the Compact can be interpreted other\nthan as a yielding by both States of what they claimed to\nbe their sovereign powers. The only issue is what sover-\neign powers were yielded, and that is best determined\nfrom the language of the Compact, with no thumb on the\nscales.\n  Besides relying on the presumption, the Special Master\nbelieved (and the Court believes) that New Jersey\u2019s claims\nmust be viewed askance because it is implausible that\nDelaware would have \u201cgiven up all governing authority\nover the disputed area while receiving nothing in return.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. But Delaware received plenty in return. First\nof all, it assured access of its citizens to fisheries on the\nside of the river claimed by New Jersey\u2014something it\nevidently cared more about than the power to control\nwharfing out from the Jersey shore, which it had never\ntheretofore exercised. And it obtained (as the Compact\nobserved) \u201cthe amicable termination\u201d of New Jersey\u2019s\nthen-pending original action in the Supreme Court, which\nhad \u201cbeen pending for twenty-seven years and upwards.\u201d\n34 Stat. 858\u2013859. How plausible it was that Delaware\nwould give up anything to get rid of that suit surely de-\npends upon how confident Delaware was that it would\nprevail. And to tell the truth, the case appeared to be\ngoing badly. As the Compact observed, the Supreme\nCourt had issued a preliminary injunction against Dela-\nware \u201crestraining the execution of certain statutes of the\n4                NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState of Delaware relating to fisheries.\u201d Id., at 859. The\norder issuing that injunction had remarked that Delaware\nhad now \u201cinterfered with and claimed to control the right\nof fishing\u201d which New Jerseyites had \u201cheretofore been\naccustomed\u201d to exercise without Delaware\u2019s interference\nfor over 70 years. Order in New Jersey v. Delaware, No. 1,\nOrig. (filed 1877), Lodging for Brief of State of Delaware in\nOpposition to State of New Jersey\u2019s Motion to Reopen (Tab\n1). By providing for dismissal of New Jersey\u2019s suit, the\nCompact assured Delaware that the Supreme Court\u2019s\nrather ominous sounding preliminary order would not\nbecome the Court\u2019s holding, perhaps the consequence of a\nrationale that gave New Jersey jurisdiction in the river.\n                            II\n  Article VII of the 1905 Compact between New Jersey\nand Delaware reads as follows:\n    \u201cEach State may, on its own side of the river, continue\n    to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and na-\n    ture, and to make grants, leases, and conveyances of\n    riparian lands and rights under the laws of the re-\n    spective States.\u201d 34 Stat. 860.\nAs the Court recognizes, this provision allocates to each\nState jurisdiction over a bundle of rights that, at the time\nof the Compact, riparian landowners, or \u201cowners of land\nabutting on bodies of water,\u201d possessed under the common\nlaw \u201cby reason of their adjacency.\u201d 1 H. Farnham, Law of\nWaters and Water Rights \u00a762, p. 278 (1904) (Farnham).\nThose riparian rights included the right to \u201cfill in and to\nbuild wharves and other structures in the shallow water\nin front of [the upland] and below low-water mark.\u201d Id.,\n\u00a7113b, at 534.

Thus, wharves could be built up to \u201cthe\npoint of navigability,\u201d J. Gould, Treatise on the Law of\nWaters, including Riparian Rights \u00a7181, p. 352 (2d ed.\n1891) (Gould), so long as they did not \u201cinterfere needlessly\nwith the right of navigation\u201d possessed by members of the\ngeneral public upon navigable waters, 1 Farnham \u00a7111,\nat 521.\n  The two States would have been acquainted with this\ncommon law. New Jersey case law comported with the\nhornbook rules. According to the State\u2019s Court of Errors\nand Appeals, it was \u201cundoubted\u201d and the \u201ccommon under-\nstanding\u201d that \u201cthe owners of land bounding on navigable\nwaters had an absolute right to wharf out and otherwise\nreclaim the land down to and even below low water, pro-\nvided that they did not thereby impede the paramount\nright of navigation.\u201d Bell v. Gough, 23 N. J. L. 624, 658\n(1852) (opinion of Elmer, J.); see also J. Angell, Treatise on\nthe Right of Property in Tide Waters and in the Soil and\nShores Thereof 234 (1847) (\u201c[T]he right of a riparian pro-\nprietor to \u2018wharf out\u2019 into a public river, is a local custom\nin New Jersey\u201d); Gould \u00a7171, at 342 (\u201c[T]he common un-\nderstanding in [New Jersey] carries the right [to wharf\nout] even below low-water mark, provided there is no\nobstruction to the navigation\u201d). Case authority in Dela-\nware seems to be lacking, but in New Jersey v. Delaware II\nthe State assured the Special Master at oral argument\nthat \u201cit is undoubtedly true in the State of Delaware . . .\nthat the upland owner had the right to wharf out . . .\nsubject only that you must not . . . obstruct navigation.\u201d\n1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary Judgment\n126a\u20131 (hereinafter NJ App.).\n   Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each\n6                NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\u2014the \u201cauthority of a sovereign\npower to govern or legislate,\u201d Webster\u2019s International\nDictionary of the English Language (1898)\u2014over wharfing\nout on \u201cits own side of the river.\u201d To emphasize that this\njurisdiction was plenary\u2014that it included, for example,\nnot merely the power to prohibit wharfing out but also the\npower to permit it\u2014Article VII specified that the jurisdic-\ntion it conferred would be \u201cof every kind and nature.\u201d\n   And finally, the jurisdictional grant was not framed as\nthough it was conferring on either State some hitherto\nunexercised power. Rather, the Compact provided that\neach State would \u201ccontinue to\u201d exercise the allocated \u201cri-\nparian jurisdiction,\u201d clearly envisioning that each State\nwould wield in the future the same authority over riparian\nrights it had wielded in the past. 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis\nadded). This is significant because, before adoption of the\nCompact in 1905, New Jersey alone had regulated the\nconstruction of riparian improvements on New Jersey\u2019s\nside of the Delaware River. It had repeatedly authorized\nthe construction of piers and wharves that extended be-\nyond the low-water line. App. to Report C\u20134 to C\u20135 (list-\ning New Jersey Acts authorizing riparian landowners to\nconstruct wharves); 7 NJ App. 1196a\u20131199a. Delaware,\nby contrast, had never regulated riparian rights on the\nNew Jersey side, and indeed, at the time of the Compact\neven on its own side there was \u201clittle evidence of [the\nState\u2019s] active involvement in shoreland develop-\nment . . . .\u201d Report 69.\n   I would think all of this quite conclusive of the fact that\nNew Jersey was given full and exclusive control over\nriparian rights on the New Jersey side. The Court con-\ncludes that this was not so, however, in part because of the\nalleged implausibility of Delaware\u2019s \u201cgiv[ing] up all gov-\nerning authority . . . while receiving nothing in return,\u201d\nante, at 13 (a mistaken contention that I have already\naddressed), and in part because \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d is\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndifferent from \u201cexclusive jurisdiction,\u201d the term used in an\n1834 Compact between New Jersey and New York, which\nreferred to \u201cthe exclusive jurisdiction of and over the\nwharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made\non the shore . . . .\u201d Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, Art.\nThird, 4 Stat. 710.\n   I willingly concede that exclusive riparian jurisdiction is\nnot the same as \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d simpliciter. It\nincludes only exclusive jurisdiction over riparian rights\nwhich, as I have described, include the right to erect\nwharves for the loading and unloading of goods. That\njurisdiction does not necessarily include, for example, the\npower to permit or forbid the construction of a casino on\nthe wharf, or even the power to serve legal process on the\nwharf. Jurisdiction to control such matters\u2014which were\nnot established as part of riparian rights by the common-\nlaw and hornbook sources that the parties relied on in\nframing the Compact\u2014may well fall outside the scope of\nthe \u201criparian jurisdiction\u201d that the Compact grants. See,\ne.g., Tewksbury v. Deerfield Beach, 763 So. 2d 1071 (Fla.\nApp. 1999) (operation of a restaurant on a dock is not\nincluded within riparian rights). Such powers\u2014which\nmay well have been conveyed by a grant of \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction\u201d such as that contained in the New York-New\nJersey Compact\u2014are not at issue in this case. What is at\nissue is jurisdiction over the core riparian right of building\na wharf to be used for the loading and unloading of cargo.\nAnd that that jurisdiction was given exclusively to New\nJersey is made perfectly clear by the Compact\u2019s recogni-\ntion of each State\u2019s riparian jurisdiction only \u201con its own\nside of the river.\u201d 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). It does\nnot take vast experience in textual interpretation to con-\nclude that this implicitly excludes each State\u2019s riparian\njurisdiction on the other State\u2019s side of the river. (Inclusio\nunius est exclusio alterius.) There was no need, therefore,\nto specify exclusive riparian jurisdiction.\n8                NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court\u2019s position gains no support from the fact that\nthe rights of a private riparian owner \u201c \u2018are always subor-\ndinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate\ntheir exercise in the interest of the public.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12\n(quoting 1 Farnham \u00a763, at 284). The Compact did not\npurport to convey mere private rights, but rather \u201criparian\njurisdiction of every kind and nature.\u201d If that means\nanything at all, it means that New Jersey is the State that\n\u201cmay regulate [the] exercise [of the rights of a private\nriparian owner] in the interest of the public.\u201d Delaware\u2019s\ncontention that it retains the authority to prohibit under\nits police power even those activities that are specifically\nallowed to New Jersey under the Compact renders not just\nArticle VII but most of the Compact a virtual nullity.\nArticle III, for example, gives the States \u201ccommon right of\nfishery throughout, in, and over the waters\u201d of the Dela-\nware. 34 Stat. 859. But under its police powers a sover-\neign State could regulate fishing within its public naviga-\nble waters.      See Gould \u00a7189, at 362.        Thus, under\nDelaware\u2019s view, just as its ownership of the riverbed\nwould allow it to trump New Jersey\u2019s authority to permit\nwharfing out, so also its ownership of the riverbed would\nallow it to prevent fishing. That would be an extraordi-\nnary result, since the litigation the 1905 Compact was\ndesigned to resolve arose over fishing rights, after Dela-\nware enacted a law in 1871 requiring New Jersey fisher-\nmen to obtain a Delaware license. See Report 3\u20136.\n                              III\n  The Court, following the Special Master\u2019s analysis, see\nReport 68\u201384, asserts that today\u2019s judgment is supported\nby the parties\u2019 course of conduct after conclusion of the\nCompact. I frankly think post-Compact conduct irrelevant\nto this case, since it can properly be used only to clarify an\nambiguous agreement, and there is no ambiguity here.\nThe Court, moreover, overstates the post-Compact conduct\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfavoring Delaware\u2019s position and understates the post-\nCompact conduct favoring New Jersey. But even if post-\nCompact conduct is consulted, no such conduct\u2014none\nwhatever\u2014supports the Court\u2019s \u201cextraordinary character\u201d\ntest, whereas several instances of such conduct strongly\nsupport the resolution I have suggested in this dissent.\n  The Court relies upon four instances of Delaware\u2019s\nexercise of jurisdiction over wharfing out from the Jersey\nshore, and two instances of New Jersey\u2019s acquiescence in\nsuch an exercise\u2014all postdating 1969. As to the former,\nthe three structures extending from New Jersey into\nDelaware built between 1969 and 2006 were permitted by\nDelaware, ante, at 21; and another application for a per-\nmit was denied, ante, at 20. The Court never establishes,\nhowever, that these instances of Delaware\u2019s assertion of\njurisdiction related to wharves of \u201cextraordinary charac-\nter,\u201d which is the only jurisdiction that the Court\u2019s decree\nconfers upon Delaware. At best, these assertions of juris-\ndiction support not the Court\u2019s opinion, but rather Dela-\nware\u2019s assertion that it may regulate all wharves on the\nriver\u2014an assertion that the Court rejects. The same\nmismatch is present with both instances of New Jersey\u2019s\nasserted acquiescence. One of them was New Jersey\u2019s\napplication for Delaware\u2019s permission to refurbish the\nstone pier at Fort Mott State Park, described ante, at 21.\nThat construction could not conceivably be characterized\nas of \u201cextraordinary character,\u201d and thus New Jersey did\nnot need to ask Delaware for permission under the Court\u2019s\ntheory. In the other instance, described ante, at 20\u201321,\nNew Jersey\u2019s Coastal Management Agency assured the\nSecretary of Commerce that \u201c \u2018any New Jersey project\nextending beyond mean low water\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) had\nto be approved by Delaware\u2019s Coastal Management\nAgency as well as New Jersey\u2019s. This again supports\n10                   NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nDelaware\u2019s theory of this case, but not the Court\u2019s.*\n  While post-Compact conduct provides no\u2014absolutely\nzero\u2014support for the Court\u2019s interpretation, it provides\nsubstantial support for the one I have suggested. In New\nJersey v. Delaware II, a case before this Court involving\nprecisely the meaning of the Compact, the Attorney Gen-\neral of Delaware (obviously authorized to present the\nState\u2019s position on the point) conceded to the Special\nMaster that \u201cArticle VII of the Compact is obviously\nmerely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of\nNew Jersey and a cession to the State of New Jersey by\nthe State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those\nrights.\u201d 1 NJ App. 123a (emphasis added). And at oral\nargument before the Special Master, Delaware\u2019s Special\nCounsel\u2014Clarence A. Southerland, a former State Attor-\nney General and future Chief Justice of the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware, see Delaware Bar in the Twentieth\nCentury 375 (H. Winslow, A. Bookout, & P. Hannigan eds.\n1994)\u2014explained that \u201cthe Compact of 1905 expressly\nacknowledged the rights of the citizens of New Jersey, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The post-Compact-conduct argument is not the only portion of the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning that is a mismatch with its conclusion. So is its\nreliance upon Article VIII of the Compact, ante, at 11, 22\u2014an argument\nso weak that it deserves only a footnote response. Article VIII provides\nthat nothing in the Compact \u201cshall affect the territorial limits, rights,\nor jurisdiction of either State . . . except as herein expressly set forth.\u201d\n34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). But New Jersey\u2019s riparian rights are\nexpressly set forth, so the only question\u2014the one I have addressed\nabove\u2014is what those rights consist of. But accepting the Court\u2019s over-\nreading of Article VIII (which presumably requires each of the riparian\nrights to be named one by one), it is utterly impossible to see why\nArticle VIII is any more \u201cexpres[s]\u201d in setting forth New Jersey\u2019s\nauthority over wharves that lack \u201cextraordinary character\u201d than it is in\nsetting forth her authority over wharves that possess it. Once again,\nthe argument supports not the Court\u2019s holding, but rather Delaware\u2019s\nmore expansive theory that it may regulate any and all wharves built\nfrom the Jersey shoreline. There is, to tell the truth, nothing whatever\nto support the Court\u2019s holding.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nleast, by implication to wharf out\u201d and that New Jersey\npossessed \u201call the right to control the erection of those\nwharves and to say who shall erect them.\u201d 1 NJ App.\n126a\u20131 (emphasis added). And in its Supreme Court brief\nin that litigation, Delaware assured the Court, without\nconditions, that \u201cDelaware has never questioned the right\nof citizens of New Jersey to wharf out to navigable water\nnor can such a right be questioned now because it is\nclearly protected by the Compact of 1905 between the\nStates.\u201d Id., at 139a (emphasis added). Delaware\u2019s Su-\npreme Court brief rejected New Jersey\u2019s argument that, if\nthe Court found the boundary line to be the low-water\nmark on the New Jersey shore, \u201cthe interests of the ripar-\nian owners will be either destroyed or seriously preju-\ndiced.\u201d That concern, Delaware said, was misguided\nbecause the 1905 Compact \u201crecognized the rights of ripar-\nian owners in the river to wharf out.\u201d Id., at 140a. \u201cThe\neffect of Article VII of the Compact,\u201d the brief explained,\n\u201cwas that the State of Delaware recognized the rights of\nthe inhabitants on the east side of the river to wharf out to\nnavigable water. This right had never been questioned\nand was undoubtedly inserted to put beyond question the\nriparian rights (as distinguished from title) of land owners\nin New Jersey.\u201d Id., at 141a. These concessions are pow-\nerful indication that Delaware\u2019s understanding of the\nCompact was the same as the one I assert.\n                              IV\n  Our opinion in Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56\n(2003), effectively decided this case. It rejected the very\nsame assertion of a riverbed-owning State\u2019s supervening\npolice-power authority over constructions into the river\nfrom a State that had been conceded riparian rights. That\ncase involved two governing documents rather than (as\nhere) only one. The first, a 1785 compact, provided:\n    \u201c \u2018The citizens of each state respectively shall have full\n12                NEW JERSEY v.

Maryland, we observed, was\n\u201cdoubtless correct that if her sovereignty over the River\nwas well settled as of 1785, we would apply a strong pre-\nsumption against reading the Compact as stripping her\nauthority to regulate activities on the River.\u201d Id., at 67.\nBut because the \u201cscope of Maryland\u2019s sovereignty over the\nRiver was in dispute both before and after the 1785 Com-\npact,\u201d no such presumption existed. Id., at 68.\n  Today\u2019s opinion, quoting the Special Master, claims that\nthe result in Virginia v.

And of course virtually every\nwritten agreement or award has \u201cunique language,\u201d so if\nwe could only extend to other cases legal principles per-\ntaining to identical language our interpretive jurispru-\ndence would be limited indeed. The documents in Virginia\nv. Maryland said in other words precisely what the Com-\npact here said: that one of the States (there, Virginia,\nhere, New Jersey) was given riparian rights, including the\nright to construct wharves and improvements. And the\nholding of the case was that those rights could be exer-\ncised free of police power or other interference by the State\nowning the riverbed.\n   The Court contends that in Virginia v. Maryland the\narbitration award, rather than the compact, \u201cwas defini-\ntive,\u201d because it recognized the right of Virginia \u201c \u2018qua\nsovereign,\u2019 \u201d and nowhere made the right \u201c \u2018subject to\nMaryland\u2019s regulatory authority.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 18 (quoting\n540 U. S., at 72). But Article VII of the Compact here at\nissue likewise spoke of the rights of New Jersey \u201cqua\nsovereign\u201d (what else does the \u201cexercise [of] riparian juris-\ndiction\u201d mean?) and similarly did not make those rights\nsubject to Delaware\u2019s regulatory authority. We stressed in\nVirginia v. Maryland that the salient factor in the inter-\npretation of the compact (and hence in the arbitration\naward\u2019s interpretation of the compact) was that it was\nentered into (like the Compact here) by way of settlement\nof a continuing boundary dispute. \u201cIf any inference at all\nis to be drawn from [the compact\u2019s] silence on the subject\nof regulatory authority,\u201d we said, \u201cit is that each State was\nleft to regulate the activities of her own citizens.\u201d Id., at\n67. \tVirginia v. Maryland effectively decided this case.\n                            V\n  Finally, I must remark at greater length upon the\nCourt\u2019s peculiar limitation upon New Jersey\u2019s wharfing-\n14               NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nout rights\u2014that it excludes wharves of \u201cextraordinary\ncharacter.\u201d But for that limitation, the Court\u2019s conclusion\nis precisely the same as my own: \u201cGiven the authority over\nriparian rights that the 1905 Compact preserves for New\nJersey, Delaware may not impede ordinary and usual\nexercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from\nNew Jersey\u2019s shore.\u201d Ante, at 23. The Court inexplicably\nconcludes, however, that the liquefied natural gas (LNG)\nunloading wharf at stake in this litigation \u201cgoes well\nbeyond the ordinary or usual.\u201d Ibid. Why? Because it\npossesses \u201cextraordinary character.\u201d\n   To our knowledge (and apparently to the Court\u2019s, judg-\ning by its failure to cite any authority) the phrase has\nnever been mentioned before in any case involving limita-\ntions on wharfing out. What in the world does it mean?\nWould a pink wharf, or a zig-zagged wharf qualify? To-\nday\u2019s opinion itself gives the phrase no content other than\nto say that \u201cDelaware\u2019s classification of the proposed LNG\nunloading terminal as a \u2018heavy industry use\u2019 and a \u2018bulk\nproduct transfer facilit[y],\u2019 . . . has not been, and hardly\ncould be, challenged as inaccurate.\u201d Ibid. This rationale\nis bizarre. There is no reason why any designation by the\nDelaware Department of Natural Resources and Envi-\nronmental Control would be relevant to, let alone control-\nling on, the meaning of the 1905 Compact; and no reason\nwhy New Jersey\u2019s authority under the 1905 Compact\nshould turn on the state-law question whether Delaware\n\u201crationally categorize[s]\u201d a wharf under its own statutes,\nante, at 23, n. 21. Wharves were commonly used for\n\u201cheavy industry use\u201d when the 1905 Compact was\nadopted, and their primary commercial use was to transfer\nbulk cargoes. One roughly contemporaneous book on the\ndesign and building of wharves in America included in-\nformation on appropriate pavement material to enable use\nof trucks on wharves, the proper method of laying down\nrailroad tracks, and the construction of hatch cranes for\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Greene, Wharves and Piers: Their\nDesign, Construction, and Equipment 191\u2013194, 206\u2013215\n(1917). The Court gives no reason why the terminal\u2019s\ncharacter as a \u201cheavy industry use\u201d and a \u201cbulk product\ntransfer facilit[y]\u201d matters in the slightest. Indeed, the\nCourt does not take its state-law reason for \u201cextraordinary\ncharacter\u201d seriously, conceding that Delaware could not\nregulate an identical wharf for the \u201cbulk product transfer\u201d\nof \u201ctofu and bean sprouts,\u201d ante, at 23, n. 21.\n   Apart from the Delaware Department\u2019s \u201cheavy industry\nuse\u201d and \u201cbulk product transfer\u201d designations, the Court\ncites, as support for its conclusion that this wharf is of\n\u201cextraordinary character\u201d its own factual background\nsection describing the wharf. See ante, at 23 (citing ante,\nat 5\u20136). It is not clear which, if any, of the facts discussed\nthere the Court claims to be relevant, and I am forced to\nspeculate on what they might be.\n   Could it be the size of the wharf, which is 2,000 feet\nlong, see ante, at 6, and extends some 1,455 feet into\nDelaware territory, see Brief for BP America Inc. as\nAmicus Curiae 1\u20132? But the Court cites not a single\nsource for this length limitation upon wharfing out. We\ndid not intimate, in holding in Virginia v. Maryland that\nVirginia could authorize construction of a water intake\npipe extending 725 feet from its shoreline into Maryland,\nsee 540 U. S., at 63, that the result turned on the length of\nthe pipe. As I have discussed, the common law did estab-\nlish a size limitation for wharves: the wharf could not be\nextended so far as to interfere needlessly with the public\u2019s\n\u201cright of navigation\u201d in navigable waters. 1 Farnham\n\u00a7111, at 521. Wharves constructed to access the water\ncould \u201cproject to a distance from the shore necessary to\nreach water which shall float vessels, the largest as well as\nthe smallest.\u201d Id., \u00a7111, at 522 (emphasis added). Dela-\nware has not claimed that the wharf in this case will\ninterfere with navigation of the river, which is approxi-\n16               NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmately one mile wide at this location, see Brief for BP\nAmerica Inc. as Amicus Curiae 2. And the record reveals\nthat New Jersey, at least, anticipated that wharves on its\nside of the river could extend as far as the wharf in this\ncase by establishing pierhead lines in 1877 and 1916 that\nextended \u201cbelow low water mark at distances varying from\n378 to 3,550 feet.\u201d 1 NJ App. 135a; see also 3 id., at 376a\n(affidavit of Richard G. Castagna). (Pierhead lines mark\nthe permissible \u201coutshore limit of structures of any kind.\u201d\nGreene, supra, at 27.)\n  Could the fact rendering this a wharf of \u201cextraordinary\ncharacter\u201d be that its construction would require the\ndredging of 1.24 million cubic yards of soil within Dela-\nware\u2019s territory? Ante, at 6. This is suggested, perhaps,\nby the portion of the Decree which says that \u201cDelaware\nacted within the scope of its governing authority to pro-\nhibit unreasonable uses of the . . . soil within the twelve-\nmile circle.\u201d Ante, at 24; see also ante, at 6, n. 8. But no\nagain. Although the record contains no evidence of the\ndredge volumes required to construct the wharves on the\nriver at the time of the Compact\u2019s adoption, it does show\nthat an 1896 navigational improvement required the\ndredging of 35 million cubic yards from the Delaware\nRiver, and a 1907 dredging at Cape May Harbor, New\nJersey, removed 19.7 million cubic yards. 7 NJ App.\n1234a (affidavit of J. Richard Weggel). At the very least,\nthe dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards \u201cwould have been\nfamiliar to or ascertainable by individuals interested in\nriparian uses or structures at the time the Compact was\nsigned or ratified.\u201d Id., at 1227a. I do not know what to\nmake of the Court\u2019s response that the instances of dredg-\ning that I have cited involved \u201cpublic works.\u201d Ante, at 6,\nn. 8. Is that a limitation upon the Court\u2019s holding\u2014only\nprivate wharves of \u201cextraordinary character\u201d can be regu-\nlated by Delaware? But in fact dredging seems to have\nnothing to do with the issue, since (once again) the Court\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nacknowledges that the same wharf for tofu and bean\nsprouts would be OK.\n   Could the determinative fact be that the wharf would\nservice \u201c[s]upertankers with capacities of up to 200,000\ncubic meters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship\nthen carrying natural gas),\u201d ante, at 6; that these ships\n\u201cwould pass densely populated areas\u201d and require estab-\nlishment of \u201ca moving safety zone [that] would restrict\nother vessels 3,000 feet ahead and behind, and 1,500 feet\non all sides,\u201d ante, at 6, n. 7? This is suggested, perhaps,\nby the portion of the Decree which says that \u201cDelaware\nacted within the scope of its governing authority to pro-\nhibit unreasonable uses of the river . . . within the twelve-\nmile circle.\u201d Ante, at 24. But surely not. Whatever power\nDelaware has to restrict traffic on the waters of the\nUnited States (a question not presented by this case,\nthough one that seems not to inhibit the Decree\u2019s blithe\npositing of state \u201cauthority to prohibit unreasonable\nuses of the river,\u201d ibid.), it has no bearing on whether\nNew Jersey can build the wharf without Delaware\u2019s\ninterference.\n   Could the determinative fact be that the wharf will be\nused to transport liquefied natural gas, which is danger-\nous? No again. The Court cites no support, and I am\naware of none, for the proposition that the common law\nforbade a wharf owner to load or unload hazardous goods.\nAt the time of the Compact\u2019s adoption, congressional\nsources reported that the Delaware River was used to\ntransport, among other items, coal tar and pitch, sulfur,\ngunpowder, and explosives. Annual Report of the Chief of\nEngineers, United States Army, H. R. Doc. No. 22, 59th\nCong., 2d Sess., 1031\u20131033 (App. H) (1906) (tabulating\ncommerce on the Delaware River by item in 1904 and\n1905). Books published some time after the adoption of\nthe Compact discuss the proper handling of seaborne\n\u201cdangerous goods,\u201d including liquids such as benzene,\n18               NEW JERSEY v. DELAWARE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npetroleum, and turpentine. See J. Aeby, Dangerous Goods\n(2d ed. 1922); R. MacElwee & T. Taylor, Wharf Manage-\nment: Stevedoring and Storage 41, 221 (1921). There is\nnot a shred of evidence that the parties to the Compact\nunderstood that New Jersey and Delaware would not be\nauthorized to grant riparian rights for the loading and\nunloading of goods that are\u2014under some amorphous and\nunexplained criteria\u2014dangerous.\n  I say that none of these factors has any bearing upon\nwhether, at law, the wharfing out at issue here is any-\nthing more than the usual and ordinary exercise of a\nriparian right. I am not so rash as to suggest, however,\nthat these factors had nothing to do with the Court\u2019s\ndecision. After all, our environmentally sensitive Court\nconcedes that if New Jersey had approved a wharf of\nequivalent dimensions, to accommodate tankers of equiva-\nlent size, carrying tofu and bean sprouts, Delaware could\nnot have interfered. See ante, at 23, n. 21.\n                         *    *    *\n   According to one study, construction activities on the\nLNG facility in this case would have created more than\n1,300 new jobs, added $277 million to New Jersey\u2019s gross\nstate product, and produced $13 million in state and local\ntax revenues. J. Seneca et al., Economic Impacts of BP\u2019s\nProposed Crown Landing LNG Terminal 65, online at\nhttp://www.policy.rutgers.edu/news/reports/BPCrownLand\ning.pdf (as visited Mar. 28, 2008, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). Operation of the facility was projected\nto generate 231 permanent jobs, and more than $88 mil-\nlion in state and local tax revenues over a 30-year period.\nIbid. Its delivery capacity would represent 15 percent of\nthe current consumption of natural gas in the region. Id.,\nat 66.

If one were to design, ex ante,\nthe socially optimal allocation of the power to permit and\nforbid wharfing out, surely that power would be lodged\nwith the sovereign that stands most to gain from the\nbenefits of a wharf, and most to lose from its environ-\nmental and other costs. Unquestionably, that is the sov-\nereign with jurisdiction over the land from which the\nwharf is extended. Delaware and New Jersey doubtless\nrealized this when they agreed in 1905 that each of them\nwould have jurisdiction over riparian rights on its own\nside of the river. The genius of today\u2019s decision is that it\ncreates irrationality where sweet reason once prevailed\u2014\nstraining mightily, against all odds, to assure that the\npower to permit or forbid \u201cheavy industry use\u201d wharves in\nNew Jersey shall rest with Delaware, which has no inter-\nest whatever in facilitating the delivery of goods to New\nJersey, which has relatively little to lose from the danger-\nous nature of those goods or the frequency and manner of\ntheir delivery, and which may well have an interest in\nforcing the inefficient location of employment- and tax-\nproducing wharves on its own shore. It makes no sense.\n  Under its Decree, \u201c[t]he Court retains jurisdiction to\nentertain such further proceedings, enter such orders, and\nissue such writs as it may from time to time deem neces-\nsary or desirable to give proper force and effect to this\nDecree or to effectuate the rights of the parties.\u201d Ante, at\n25. This could mean, I suppose, that we can anticipate a\nwhole category of original actions in this Court that will\nclarify, wharf by wharf, what is a wharf of \u201cextraordinary\ncharacter.\u201d (Who would have thought that such utterly\nindefinable and unpredictable complexity lay hidden\nwithin the words of the Compact?)

In an earlier contest between the two States, this Court upheld the title of Delaware to \"the river and the subaqueous soil\" within the circle \"up to [the] low water mark on the easterly or New Jersey side.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102211\"><a href=\"/opinion/102211/new-jersey-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 385, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware II).</i><sup>[1]</sup> Prior to that 1934 boundary determination, in 1905, the two States had entered into an accord (1905 Compact or Compact), which Congress ratified in 1907. The Compact accommodated both States' concerns on matters over which the States had crossed swords: service of civil and criminal process on vessels and rights of fishery within the twelve-mile zone. Although the parties were unable to reach agreement on the interstate boundary at that time, the 1905 Compact contained two jurisdictional provisions important to the current dispute:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Art. VII. Each State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature, and to make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights under the laws of the respective States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Art. VIII. Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" Act of Jan. 24, 1907, 34 Stat. 860.</blockquote>\n<p>The controversy we here resolve was sparked by Delaware's refusal to grant permission for construction of a liquefied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1416</span> natural gas (LNG) unloading terminal that would extend some 2,000 feet from New Jersey's shore into territory <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> adjudged to belong to Delaware. The LNG plant, storage tanks, and other structures would be maintained onshore in New Jersey. Relying on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, New Jersey urged that it had exclusive jurisdiction over all projects appurtenant to its shores, including wharves extending past the low-water mark on New Jersey's side into Delaware territory. Delaware asserted regulatory authority, undiminished by Article VII, over structures located within its borders; in support, Delaware invoked, <i>inter alia,</i> Article VIII of the 1905 Compact and our decision in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II.</i> The Special Master we appointed to superintend the proceedings filed a report recommending a determination that Delaware has authority to regulate the proposed construction, concurrently with New Jersey, to the extent that the project reached beyond New Jersey's border and extended into Delaware's domain.</p>\n<p>We accept the Special Master's recommendation in principal part. Article VII of the 1905 Compact, we hold, did not secure to New Jersey <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction over all riparian improvements commencing on its shores.<sup>[2]</sup> The parties' own conduct, since the time Delaware has endeavored to regulate coastal development, supports the conclusion to which other relevant factors point: New Jersey and Delaware have overlapping authority to regulate riparian structures and operations of extraordinary character extending outshore of New Jersey's domain into territory over which Delaware is sovereign.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Disputes between New Jersey and Delaware concerning the boundary along the Delaware River (or River) separating the two States have persisted \"almost from the beginning of statehood.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> 291 U.S., at 376, 54 S.Ct. 407. The history of the States' competing claims of sovereignty, rehearsed at length in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> need not be detailed here. In brief, tracing title through a series of deeds originating with a 1682 grant from the Duke of York to William Penn, Delaware asserted dominion, within the twelve-mile circle, over the River and its subaqueous lands up to the low-water mark on the New Jersey side. <i>Id.,</i> at 364, 374, 54 S.Ct. 407.<sup>[3]</sup> New Jersey claimed sovereign ownership up to the middle of the navigable channel. <i>Id.,</i> at 363-364, 54 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p>The instant proceeding is the third original action New Jersey has commenced against Delaware involving the Delaware River boundary between the two States. The first action, <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> No. 1, Orig. (filed 1877) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware I),</i> was propelled by the States' disagreements over fishing rights. See Report of Special Master 3 (Report).<sup>[4]</sup> That case \"slumbered for many years.\" <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> 291 U.S., at 377, 54 S.Ct. 407. Eventually, the parties negotiated a Compact, which both States approved in 1905, and Congress ratified in 1907. See Act of Jan. 24, 1907, ch. 394, 34 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1417</span> Stat. 858. Modest in comparison to the parties' initial aim, the Compact left location of the interstate boundary an unsettled question.<sup>[5]</sup> New Jersey then withdrew its complaint and this Court dismissed the case without prejudice. <i>New Jersey v. Delaware I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></span>, 27 S.Ct. 793, 51 L.Ed. 925 (1907).</p>\n<p>The second original action, <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> was fueled by a dispute over ownership of an oyster bed in the River below the twelve-mile circle. See Report 14. In response to New Jersey's complaint, the Court conclusively settled the boundary between the States. Confirming the Special Master's report, the Court held that, within the twelve-mile circle, Delaware owns the River and the subaqueous soil up to the low-water mark on the New Jersey side. 291 U.S., at 385, 54 S.Ct. 407.<sup>[6]</sup> But New Jersey gained the disputed oyster bed: South of the circle, the Court adjudged the boundary \"to be the middle of the main ship channel in Delaware River and Bay.\" <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102482\"><a href=\"/opinion/102482/the-state-of-new-jersey-complainant-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 699, 55 S.Ct. 907, 79 L.Ed. 1659 (1935) (Decree) (perpetually enjoining the States from further disputing the boundary).</p>\n<p>In upholding Delaware's title to the area within the twelve-mile circle, the Court rejected an argument pressed by New Jersey based on the 1905 Compact: By agreeing to the Compact, New Jersey urged, Delaware had abandoned any claim of ownership beyond the middle of the River. The Court found New Jersey's argument \"wholly without force.\" 291 U.S., at 377, 54 S.Ct. 407. \"The compact of 1905,\" the Court declared, \"provides for the enjoyment of riparian rights, for concurrent jurisdiction in respect of civil and criminal process, and for concurrent rights of fishery. Beyond that it does not go.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 377-378, 54 S.Ct. 407. The Court next recited in full the text of Article VIII of the Compact: \"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 378, 54 S.Ct. 407 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The current controversy arose out of the planned construction of facilities to import, store, and vaporize foreign-source LNG; the proposed project would be operated by Crown Landing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of British Petroleum (BP). See Report 19; 6 App. of Delaware on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment 3793, 3804-3807 (hereinafter Del.App.) (Request for Coastal Zone Status Decision). The \"Crown Landing\" project would include a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1418</span> gasification plant, storage tanks, and other structures onshore in New Jersey, and a pier and related structures extending some 2,000 feet from New Jersey's shore into Delaware. Report 19-20; 6 Del.App. 3804. Supertankers with capacities of up to 200,000 cubic meters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship then carrying natural gas) would berth at the pier. <i>Id.,</i> at 3810.<sup>[7]</sup> A multipart transfer system \u0097 including, <i>inter alia,</i> cryogenic piping, a containment trough, and utility lines \u0097 would be installed on the 6,000-square-foot unloading platform and along the pier to transport the LNG (at sufficiently cold temperatures to keep it in a liquid state) from ships to three 158,000-cubic-meter storage tanks onshore; vapor byproducts resulting from the onshore gasification would be returned to the tankers. Report 19-20; 6 Del.App. 3804; 7 <i>id.,</i> at 4307 (Cherry Affidavit). Even \"[d]uring the holding mode of terminal operation (when no ship is unloading),\" LNG would circulate through the piping along the pier to \"keep the line cold.\" 6 <i>id.,</i> at 3804. Construction of the Crown Landing project would require dredging 1.24 million cubic yards of subaqueous soil, affecting approximately 29 acres of the riverbed within Delaware's territory. Report 19-20.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In September 2004, BP sought permission from Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to construct the Crown Landing unloading terminal. See <i>id.,</i> at 20.<sup>[9]</sup> DNREC refused permission some months later on the ground that the terminal was barred by Delaware's Coastal Zone Act (DCZA), Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001 <i>et seq.</i> (2001),<sup>[10]</sup> as a prohibited \"offshore . . . bulk product transfer facilit[y]\" as well as a prohibited \" heavy industry us[e],\" \u00a7 7003; Report 20.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Reactions to DNREC's decision boiled over on both sides. New Jersey threatened to withdraw state pension funds from Delaware banks, and Delaware considered authorizing the National Guard to protect its border from encroachment. See Report <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1419</span> 21. One New Jersey legislator looked into recommissioning the museum-piece battleship U.S.S. <i>New Jersey,</i> in the event that the vessel might be needed to repel an armed invasion by Delaware. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>New Jersey commenced the instant action in 2005, seeking a declaration that Article VII of the 1905 Compact establishes its exclusive jurisdiction \"to regulate the construction of improvements appurtenant to the New Jersey shore of the Delaware River within the Twelve-Mile Circle, free of regulation by Delaware.\" Motion to Reopen and for Supplemental Decree 35; see Report 22, 29.

Report 27. He ultimately determined that the \"riparian jurisdiction\" preserved to New Jersey by Article VII of the 1905 Compact \"is not exclusive\" and that Delaware \"has overlapping jurisdiction to regulate. . . improvements outshore of the low water mark on the New Jersey side of the River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. New Jersey filed exceptions to which we now turn.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>At the outset, we summarize our decision and the principal reasons for it. In accord with the Special Master, we hold that Article VII of the 1905 Compact does not grant New Jersey exclusive jurisdiction over all riparian improvements extending outshore of the low-water mark. First, the novel term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" which the parties employed in the Compact, is properly read as a limiting modifier and not as synonymous with \"exclusive jurisdiction.\" Second, an 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York casts informative light on the later New Jersey-Delaware accord. Third, our decision in <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131148\"><a href=\"/opinion/131148/virginia-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), provides scant support for New Jersey's claim. We there held that a Maryland-Virginia <i>boundary settlement</i> gave Virginia \"sovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to build improvements appurtenant to [Virginia's] shore and to withdraw water from the [Potomac] River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. Delaware's 1905 agreement to New Jersey's exercise of \"riparian jurisdiction,\" <i>made when the boundary was still disputed,</i> cannot plausibly be read as an equivalent recognition of New Jersey's sovereign authority. Finally, Delaware's claim to regulating authority is supported by New Jersey's acceptance (until the present controversy) of Delaware's jurisdiction over water and land within its domain to preserve the quality and prevent deterioration of the State's coastal areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1420</span> A</h2>\n<p>New Jersey hinges its case on Article VII of the 1905 Compact, which it reads as conferring on \"each State complete regulatory authority over the construction and operation of riparian improvements on its shores, even if the improvements extend past the low-water mark.\" Exceptions by New Jersey to Report of Special Master and Supporting Brief 16 (hereinafter New Jersey Exceptions). <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> New Jersey recognizes, confirmed Delaware's sovereign ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within the twelve-mile circle. But, New Jersey emphasizes, the Court expressly made that determination \"subject to the Compact of 1905.\" 291 U.S., at 385, 54 S.Ct. 407. New Jersey acknowledges that Delaware \"unquestionably can exercise its police power outshore of the low-water mark.\" New Jersey Exceptions 16. New Jersey contends, however, that Delaware cannot do so in a manner that would interfere with the authority over riparian rights that Article VII of the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Because the meaning of the 1905 Compact and, in particular, Article VII, is key to the resolution of this controversy, we focus our attention on that issue. Significantly, Article VII provides that \"[e]ach State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise\" not \"exclusive jurisdiction\" or \"jurisdiction\" unmodified, but \"riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature\" 34 Stat. 860. New Jersey argues that \"riparian jurisdiction\" should be read broadly to encompass full police-power jurisdiction over activities carried out on riparian structures. New Jersey Exceptions 36-37. If New Jersey enjoys full police power over improvements extending from its shore, New Jersey reasons, then necessarily Delaware cannot encroach on that authority. See Report 54.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>We agree with the Special Master that \"`riparian' is a limiting modifier.\" Report 57.

The term \"riparian jurisdiction,\" however, was not a legal term of art in 1905, nor is it one now. See 7 Del.App. 4281 (Expert Report of Professor Joseph L. Sax (Nov. 7, 2006)). As the Special Master stated, \"riparian jurisdiction\" appears to be a verbal formulation \"devised by the [1905 Compact] drafters specifically for Article VII.\" Report 54.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the Compact, one finds the more familiar terms \"jurisdiction\" (in the introductory paragraphs and, most notably, in Article VIII) or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" (in Article IV).<sup>[14]</sup> To attribute to \"riparian jurisdiction\" the same meaning as \"jurisdiction\" unmodified, or to equate the novel term with the distinct formulation \"exclusive jurisdiction,\" would deny <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1421</span> operative effect to each word in the Compact, contrary to basic principles of construction. See <i>United States v.

Report 47-49, 58-59. Accord 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 279 (1904) (\"The riparian owner is also entitled to have his contact with the water remain intact. This is what is known as the right of access, and includes the right to erect wharves to reach the navigable portion of the stream.\"); <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 111, p. 520 (\"A wharf is a structure on the margin of navigable water, alongside of which vessels are brought for the sake of being conveniently loaded or unloaded.\"). But the Special Master also recognized that the right of a riparian owner to wharf out is subject to state regulation. Report 58; see 1 Farnham, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 63, p. 284 (rights of riparian owner \"are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public\"); <i>Shively v.

In its response to Delaware's request for admissions, New Jersey readily acknowledged that a person wishing to conduct a particular activity on a wharf, in addition to obtaining a riparian grant, would have to comply with all other \"applicable New Jersey laws, and local laws.\" 6 Del.App. 4156 (New Jersey's Responses to Delaware's First Request for Admissions \u00b6 22 (Sept. 8, 2006)). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 856, Comment <i>e,</i> pp. 246-247 (1977) (\"A state may exercise its police power by controlling the initiation and conduct of riparian and nonriparian uses of water.\"). But New Jersey sees itself, to the exclusion of Delaware, as the State empowered to regulate, for the benefit of the public, New Jersey landowners' exercise of riparian rights.</p>\n<p>In the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is also the State that has regulatory authority over the exercise of those rights. But cf. <i>Cummings v. Chicago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95790\"><a href=\"/opinion/95790/cummings-v-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 431, 23 S.Ct. 472, 47 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1422</span> L.Ed. 525 (1903) (federal regulation of wharfing out in the Calumet River did not divest local government of regulatory authority based on location of project within that government's territory). In this regard, the negotiators of the 1905 Compact faced an unusual situation: As long as the boundary issue remained unsettled, they could not know which State was sovereign within the twelve-mile circle beyond New Jersey's shore. They likely knew, however, that \"[i]n a case of wharfing out . . . `[t]he rights of a riparian owner upon a navigable stream in this country are governed by the law of the state in which the stream is situated.'\" 1 S. Wiel, Water Rights in the Western States \u00a7 898, p. 934 (3d ed.1911) (quoting <i>Weems Steamboat Co. of Baltimore v. People's Steamboat Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97064\"><a href=\"/opinion/97064/weems-steamboat-co-of-baltimore-v-peoples-steamboa/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 355, 29 S.Ct. 661, 53 L.Ed. 1024 (1909)). With the issue of sovereignty reserved by the 1905 Compact drafters for another day, the Special Master's conclusion that Article VII's reference to \"riparian jurisdiction\" did not mean \"exclusive jurisdiction\" is difficult to gainsay.</p>\n<p>The Special Master pertinently observed that, as New Jersey read the 1905 Compact, Delaware had given up all governing authority over the disputed area while receiving nothing in return. He found New Jersey's position \"implausible.\" Report 63. \"Delaware,\" the Special Master stated, \"would not have willingly ceded all jurisdiction over matters taking place on land that [Delaware adamantly] contended it owned exclusively and outright.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 64.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>New Jersey asserts that Delaware did just that, as shown by representations made during proceedings in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II.</i> New Jersey Exceptions 44. Delaware's reply brief before the Special Master in that case stated: \"Article VII of the Compact is obviously merely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of New Jersey and a cession to the State of New Jersey by the State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those rights.\" 1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary Judgment 123a. Further, at oral argument before the Special Master in that earlier fray, Delaware's counsel said that, in his view, the 1905 Compact \"ceded to the State of New Jersey all the right to control the erection of [wharves extending into the Delaware River from New Jersey's shore] and to say who shall erect them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 126a-1.</p>\n<p>The Special Master in the instant case found New Jersey's position dubious, as do we. The representations Delaware made in the course of <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the Special Master here observed, were \"fully consistent with [the Master's] interpretation of Article VII [of the 1905 Compact].\" Report 89. New Jersey did indeed preserve \"the right to exercise its own jurisdiction over riparian improvements appurtenant to its shore.\" <i>Ibid.</i> But, critically, Delaware nowhere \"suggested that New Jersey would have the <i>exclusive</i> authority to regulate all aspects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1423</span> of riparian improvements, even if on Delaware's land.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Delaware, in its argument before the Special Master, was equally uncompromising. As a result of the 1934 boundary determination, Delaware urged, \"the entire River is on Delaware's `own side,' and New Jersey consequently ha[d] no `side' of the River on which to exercise any riparian rights or riparian jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 36. Article VII of the 1905 Compact, according to Delaware, was a \"temporary\" measure, \"entirely . . . contingent on the ultimate resolution of the boundary.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 39. That reading, the Special Master demonstrated, was altogether fallacious. <i>Id.,</i> at 36-40.</p>\n<p>Seeking to harmonize Article VII with the boundary determination, the Special Master reached these conclusions. First, the 1905 Compact gave New Jersey no authority to <i>grant</i> lands owned by Delaware. <i>Id.,</i> at 45-46. Second, Article VII's preservation to each State of \"riparian jurisdiction\" means that New Jersey may control the riparian rights ordinarily and usually enjoyed by landowners on New Jersey's shore. For example, New Jersey may define \"how far a riparian owner can wharf out, the quantities of water that a riparian owner can draw from the River, and the like.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 57-58. Nevertheless, New Jersey's regulatory authority is qualified once the boundary line at low water is passed. <i>Id.,</i> at 58. Just as New Jersey cannot grant land belonging to Delaware, so New Jersey cannot authorize activities that go beyond the exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights in the face of contrary regulation by Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Interstate compacts, like treaties, are presumed to be \"the subject of careful consideration before they are entered into, and are drawn by persons competent to express their meaning, and to choose apt words in which to embody the purposes of the high contracting parties.\" <i>Rocca v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620811\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620811/rocca-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 332, 32 S.Ct. 207, 56 L.Ed. 453 (1912). Accordingly, the Special Master found informative a comparison of language in the 1905 Compact with language contained in an 1834 compact between New Jersey and New York. See Report 65. That compact established the two States' common boundary along the Hudson River. Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, 4 Stat. 708. Similar to the boundary between New Jersey and Delaware settled in 1934 in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the 1834 accord located the New Jersey-New York boundary at \"the low water-mark on the westerly or New Jersey side [of the Hudson River].\" Art. Third, 4 Stat. 710; cf. <i>supra,</i> at 1415. The 1834 agreement, however, expressly gave to New Jersey \"the <i>exclusive right</i> of property in and to the land under water lying west of the middle of the bay of New York, and west of the middle of that part of the Hudson river which lies between Manhattan island and New Jersey\" and \"<i>the exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made on the shore of the said state</i> . . .\" Art. Third, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4 Stat. 710 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\"Comparable language [conferring exclusive authority],\" the Special Master observed, \"is noticeably absent in the [1905] Compact.\" Report 66. The Master found this disparity \"conspicuous,\" <i>id.,</i> at 68, for \"[s]everal provisions in the two interstate compacts [contain] strikingly similar language,\" <i>id.,</i> at 66; see <i>id.,</i> App. J (Table Comparing Similar Provisions in the New Jersey-New York Compact of 1834 and the New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905). Given that provisions of the 1905 Compact appear to have been adopted almost verbatim from New Jersey's 1834 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1424</span> accord with New York, see <i>ibid.,</i> New Jersey could hardly claim ignorance that Article VII could have been drafted to grant New Jersey \"exclusive jurisdiction\" (not merely \"riparian jurisdiction\") over wharves and other improvements extending from its shore into navigable Delaware River waters. <i>Id.,</i> at 67.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>New Jersey urged before the Special Master, and in its exceptions to his report, that <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131148\"><a href=\"/opinion/131148/virginia-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461, is dispositive of this case.<sup>[17]</sup> Both cases involved an interstate compact, which left the boundary between the contending States unresolved, and a later determination settling the boundary. And both original actions were referred to Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr., as Special Master. We find persuasive the Special Master's reconciliation of his recommendations in the two actions. See Report 64-65, n. 118.</p>\n<p><i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> involved a 1785 compact and an 1877 arbitration award. Agreeing with the Special Master, we held that the arbitration award permitted Virginia to construct a water intake structure extending into the Potomac River, even though the award placed Virginia's boundary at the low-water mark on its own side of the Potomac. See 540 U.S., at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. \"Superficially,\" the Special Master said, \"that holding would appear to support New Jersey's argument here, <i>i.e.,</i> that construction of wharves off New Jersey's shore should not be subject to regulation by Delaware.\" Report 64, n. 118. But, the Special Master explained, the result in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> turned on \"the unique language of the compact and arbitration award involved in that case.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The key provision of the 1785 compact between Maryland and Virginia, we observed, addressed only \"the right [of the citizens of each State] to build wharves and improvements regardless of which State ultimately was determined to be sovereign over the River.\" 540 U.S., at. 69, 124 S.Ct. 598. Concerning the rights of the States, the 1877 arbitration award, not the 1785 compact, was definitive. See <i>id.,</i> at 75, 124 S.Ct. 598. The key provision of that award recognized the right of Virginia, \"<i>qua</i> sovereign,\" \"to use the River beyond low-water mark,\" a right \"nowhere made subject to Maryland's regulatory authority.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598.</p>\n<p>Confirming the \"sovereign character\" of Virginia's right, we noted, Maryland had proposed to the arbitrators that the boundary line between the States be drawn around \"all wharves and other improvements now extending or which may hereafter be extended, by authority of Virginia from the Virginia shore into the [Potomac] beyond low water mark.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> n. 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the formulation Maryland proposed was not used in the arbitration award, the arbitrators plainly manifested their intention to accomplish the same end: to safeguard \"Virginia's authority to construct riparian improvements outshore of the low water mark without regulation by Maryland.\" Report 65, n. 118; see <i>Virginia v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1425</span> <i>Maryland,</i> 540 U.S., at 73, n. 7, 124 S.Ct. 598. By contrast, in the instant case, neither the 1905 Compact, nor <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> the 1934 decision settling the boundary dispute, purported to give New Jersey \"all regulatory oversight (as opposed to merely riparian oversight)\" or to endow New Jersey with authority \"exclusive of jurisdiction by Delaware.\" Report 65, n. 118; see <i>supra,</i> at 1420-1423.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>We turn, finally, to the parties' prior course of conduct, on which the Special Master placed considerable weight. See Report 68-84; cf. <i>O'Connor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111771\"><a href=\"/opinion/111771/oconnor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 33, 107 S.Ct. 347, 93 L.Ed.2d 206 (1986) (\"The course of conduct of parties to an international agreement, like the course of conduct of parties to any contract, is evidence of its meaning.\").</p>\n<p>Until the 1960's, wharfing out from the New Jersey shore into Delaware territory was not a matter of controversy between the two States. From 1851, when New Jersey began issuing grants for such activity, through 1969, only 11 constructions straddled the interstate boundary. Report 74. At the time of the 1905 Compact and continuing into the 1950's, Delaware, unlike New Jersey, issued no grants or leases for its subaqueous lands. Delaware regulated riparian improvements solely under its common law, which limited developments only to the extent they constituted public nuisances. <i>Id.,</i> at 69.</p>\n<p>In 1961, Delaware enacted its first statute regulating submerged lands, and in 1966, it enacted broader legislation governing leases of state-owned subaqueous lands. <i>Id.,</i> at 70. The State grandfathered piers and wharves built prior to the effective date of the regulations implementing the 1966 statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 70-71. Permits were required, however, for modifications to the grandfathered structures and for new structures. <i>Id.,</i> at 71.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Then, in 1971, Delaware enacted the DCZA to prevent \"a significant danger of pollution to the coastal zone.\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001. The DCZA prohibits within the coastal zone \"[h]eavy industry uses of any kind\" and \"offshore gas, liquid or solid bulk product transfer facilities.\" \u00a7 7003. In 1972, Delaware rejected as a prohibited bulk transfer facility El Paso Eastern Company's request to build a LNG unloading facility extending from New Jersey into Delaware. 5 Del.App. 3483 (Letter from David Keifer, Director of Delaware State Planning Office, to Barry Huntsinger, El Paso Eastern Company (Feb. 23, 1972)). Shortly before denying El Paso's application, Delaware notified New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), which raised no objection to Delaware's refusal to permit the LNG terminal.<sup>[19]</sup> Delaware similarly relied on the DCZA to deny permits for construction of the Crown Landing unloading facility at issue in this case. Report 20.</p>\n<p>Also in 1972, Congress enacted the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 86 Stat. 1280, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 <i>et seq.,</i> which required States to submit their coastal management programs to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1426</span> In return, States with approved programs would receive federal funding for coastal management. See \u00a7\u00a7 1454-1455. Delaware's coastal management program, approved by the Secretary in 1979, specifically addressed LNG facilities and reported that \"`no site in Delaware [is] suitable for the location of any LNG import-export facility.'\" Report 72 (quoting 4 Del.App. 2591 (Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin. (NOAA), Delaware Coastal Management Program and Final Environmental Impact Statement 57 (Mar.1980))). The next year, 1980, New Jersey gained approval for its coastal management program. The Special Master found telling, as do we, a representation New Jersey made in its submission to the Secretary:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The New Jersey and Delaware Coastal Management agencies . . . have concluded that any New Jersey project extending beyond mean low water <i>must obtain coastal permits from both states.</i> New Jersey and Delaware, therefore, will coordinate reviews of any proposed development that would span the interstate boundary to ensure that no development is constructed unless it would be consistent with both state coastal management programs.\" Report 81 (quoting 4 Del. App. 2657 (NOAA, N.J. Coastal Management Program and Final Impact Statement 20 (Aug.1980) (emphasis added))).</blockquote>\n<p>See also Report 72-73. That representation, the Special Master observed, \"is fundamentally inconsistent with the position advanced by New Jersey here, <i>i.e.,</i> that only New Jersey has the right to regulate such projects.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>As the Special Master reported, just three structures extending from New Jersey into Delaware were built between 1969 and 2006. Delaware's DNREC issued permits for each of them. <i>Id.,</i> at 74-76. One of those projects was undertaken by New Jersey itself. The State, in 1996, sought to refurbish a stone pier at New Jersey's Fort Mott State Park. <i>Id.,</i> at 75-76. New Jersey issued a waterfront development permit for the project, but that permit approved structures only to the low-water mark. Delaware's approval was sought and obtained for structures outshore of that point. Even during the pendency of this action, New Jersey applied to Delaware for renewal of the permit covering the portion of the Fort Mott project extending into Delaware. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p><i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> upheld Delaware's ownership of the River and subaqueous soil within the twelve-mile circle. The 1905 Compact did not ordain that this Court's 1934 settlement of the boundary would be an academic exercise with slim practical significance. Tending against a reading that would give New Jersey exclusive authority, Article VIII of the Compact, as earlier emphasized, see <i>supra,</i> at 1421, states: \"Nothing herein contained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1427</span> shall affect the territorial limits, rights or jurisdiction of either State of, in or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.\" Nowhere does Article VII \"expressly set forth\" Delaware's lack of any governing authority over territory within the State's own borders. Cf. Report 43-46.</p>\n<p>The Special Master correctly determined that Delaware's once \"hands off\" policy regarding coastal development did not signal that the State never could or never would assert any regulatory authority over structures using its subaqueous land. <i>Id.,</i> at 69-70. In the decades since Delaware began to manage its waters and submerged lands to prevent \"a significant danger of pollution to the coastal zone,\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7 7001, the State has followed a consistent course: Largely with New Jersey's cooperation, Delaware has checked proposed structures and activity extending beyond New Jersey's shore into Delaware's domain in order to \"protect the natural environment of [Delaware's]. . . coastal areas.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Given the authority over riparian rights that the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey, Delaware may not impede ordinary and usual exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New Jersey's shore. The Crown Landing project, however, goes well beyond the ordinary or usual. See <i>supra,</i> at 1417-1418. Delaware's classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a \"heavy industry use\" and a \"bulk product transfer facilit[y],\" Del.Code Ann., Tit. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 7001, 7003, has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate.<sup>[21]</sup> Consistent with the scope of its retained police power to regulate certain riparian uses, it was within Delaware's authority to prohibit construction of the facility within its domain.<sup>[22]</sup> As recommended by the Special Master, we confirm Delaware's authority to deny permission for the Crown Landing terminal, overrule New Jersey's exceptions, and enter, with modifications consistent with this opinion, the decree proposed by the Special Master.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DECREE</h2>\n<p>The Court having exercised original jurisdiction over this controversy between two sovereign States; the issues having been referred to the Special Master appointed by the Court; the Court having received briefs and heard oral argument on New Jersey's exceptions to the Report of the Special Master and Delaware's responses thereto; and the Court having issued its Opinion, <i>supra,</i> at 1415-1427.</p>\n<p>It is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged, Declared, and Decreed as follows:</p>\n<p>1.(a) The State of New Jersey may, under its laws, grant and thereafter exercise governing authority over ordinary and usual riparian rights for the construction, maintenance, and use of wharves and other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1428</span> riparian improvements appurtenant to the eastern shore of the Delaware River within the twelve-mile circle and extending outshore of the low-water mark; and further</p>\n<p>(b) The State of Delaware may, under its laws and subject to New Jersey's authority over riparian rights as stated in the preceding paragraph, exercise governing authority over the construction, maintenance, and use of those same wharves and other improvements appurtenant to the eastern shore of the Delaware River within the twelve-mile circle and extending outshore of the low-water mark, to the extent that they exceed ordinary and usual riparian uses.</p>\n<p>(c) In refusing to permit construction of the proposed Crown Landing LNG unloading terminal, Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river and soil within the twelve-mile circle.</p>\n<p>2.

In my view, the construction and maintenance of wharves and other riparian improvements that extend into territory over which Delaware is sovereign may only be authorized by New Jersey to the extent that such activities are not inconsistent with Delaware's exercise of its police power. I therefore join paragraphs 1(c), 2, 3, and 4 of the Court's decree, and write separately to explain that in my view, New Jersey's authority to regulate beyond the low-water mark on its shore is subordinate to the paramount authority of the sovereign owner of the river, Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At common law, owners of land abutting bodies of water enjoyed certain rights by virtue of their adjacency to that water. See 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 279 (1904) (\"The riparian owner is . . . entitled to have his contact with the water remain intact. This is what is known as the right of access, and includes the right to erect wharves to reach the navigable portion of the stream\"). Yet those rights were by no means unlimited; \"[w]hile the rights of the riparian owner cannot be destroyed . . . they are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 63, at 284. See also 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 856, Comment <i>e</i> (1977) (\"[A] state may exercise its police power by controlling the initiation and conduct of riparian and nonriparian uses of water\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1429</span> From these authorities it is clear that the rights of riparian landowners are ordinarily subject to regulation by <i>some</i> State. The only relevant question, then, for purposes of this case, is <i>which</i> State. As the Court notes, \"[i]n the ordinary case, the State that grants riparian rights is also the State that has regulatory authority over the exercise of those rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1421. But the history of the relationship between these two States vis-a-vis their jointly bounded river takes this case out of the ordinary. In light of the 1905 Compact, our previous decision in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102211\"><a href=\"/opinion/102211/new-jersey-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934), and the States' course of conduct, I agree with the Court's sensible conclusion that within the twelve-mile circle, the two States' authority over riparian improvements is to some extent overlapping. In my judgment, however, that overlapping authority does not extend merely to the regulation of \"riparian structures and operations of extraordinary character\" beyond the low-water mark on New Jersey's shore, <i>ante,</i> at 1416, but to <i>all</i> riparian structures and operations extending out from New Jersey into Delaware's domain. I would hold, therefore, that New Jersey may only grant, and thereafter exercise governing authority over, the rights of construction, maintenance, and use of wharves and other riparian improvements beyond the low-water mark to the extent that the grant and exercise of those rights is not inconsistent with the police power of the State of Delaware.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131148\"><a href=\"/opinion/131148/virginia-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 80, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), I set forth my view that the rights enjoyed by riparian landowners along the Virginia shore of the Potomac River were subject to regulation by the owner of the river, Maryland. I there explained that \"th[e] landowners' riparian rights are\u0097like all riparian rights at common law\u0097subject to the paramount regulatory authority of the sovereign that owns the river, [Maryland],\" <i>id.,</i> at 82, 124 S.Ct. 598 (dissenting opinion). I would have held, therefore, that it was within Maryland's power to prevent the construction of the water intake facility that Fairfax County, Virginia, wished to build. <i>A fortiori,</i> then\u0097putting to one side the distinctions the Court today draws between the two cases, <i>ante,</i> at 1424-1425\u0097Delaware possesses the authority, under its laws, to restrict the construction of the proposed liquified natural gas facility that would extend hundreds of feet into its sovereign territory.</p>\n<p>But inherent in the notion of concurrency are limits to the authority of even the sovereign that owns the river. In <i>Virginia v. Maryland, supra</i><i>,</i> I noted that the case did not require the Court to \"determine the precise extent or character of Maryland's regulatory jurisdiction,\" because the issue presented was merely \"whether Maryland may impose <i>any</i> limits on . . . Virginia landowners whose property happens to abut the Potomac.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 82, 124 S.Ct. 598 (dissenting opinion). Similarly, in this case we need not definitively settle the extent to which there may exist limitations on Delaware's exercise of authority over its river and improvements thereon; for even Delaware's counsel conceded at argument that Delaware could not impose a total ban on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1430</span> the construction of wharves extending out from New Jersey's shores. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49, 50. Similarly, Delaware should not be permitted to treat differently riparian improvements extending outshore from New Jersey's land and those commencing on Delaware's own soil, absent some reasonable police-power purpose for that differential treatment. Apart from those clear constraints, however\u0097and subject to applicable federal law<sup>[2]</sup>\u0097in my view it is Delaware that possesses the primary authority over riparian improvements extending into its territory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Despite my differing views set forth herein, I do agree with the conclusion that Delaware may prohibit construction of the facility that spawned this complaint, and therefore join the portion of the Court's decree so finding.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice ALITO joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>With all due respect, I find the Court's opinion difficult to accept. The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905 (Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, addressed the \"exercise [of] riparian jurisdiction,\" and the power to \"make grants. . . of riparian . . . rights.\" The particular riparian right at issue here is the right of wharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power over that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the Delaware River. The Court says, however, that that jurisdiction and power was not exclusive. I find that difficult to accept, because if Delaware could forbid the wharfing out that Article VII allowed New Jersey to permit, Article VII was a ridiculous nullity. That could not be what was meant. The Court seeks to avoid that obstacle to credibility by saying that Delaware's jurisdiction and power is limited to forbidding \"activities that go beyond the exercise of ordinary and usual riparian rights.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1423. It is only \"riparian structures and operations of <i>extraordinary character\"</i> over which Delaware retains \"overlapping authority to regulate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1416 (emphasis added). But that also is difficult to accept, because the Court explains neither the meaning nor the provenance of its \"extraordinary character\" test. The exception (whatever it means) has absolutely no basis in prior law, which regards as beyond the \"ordinary and usual\" (and hence beyond the legitimate) only that wharfing out which interferes with navigation. So unheard-of is the exception that its first appearance in this case is in the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>I would sustain New Jersey's objections to the Special Master's Report.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>I must begin by clearing some underbrush. One of Delaware's principal arguments\u0097an argument accepted by the Master and implicitly accepted by the Court\u0097is that the 1905 Compact must not be construed to limit Delaware's pre-Compact (albeit at the time unrecognized) sovereign control over the Delaware River, because of the \"strong presumption against defeat of a State's title\" in interpreting agreements. See Report of Special Master 42-43 (Report) (quoting <i>United States v. Alaska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118128\"><a href=\"/opinion/118128/united-states-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 34, 117 S.Ct. 1888, 138 L.Ed.2d 231 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). According to Delaware, this presumption establishes that the 1905 Compact gave New Jersey the authority to <i>allocate</i> riparian rights, but left with Delaware <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1431</span> the power to <i>veto</i> exercises of those rights under its general police-power authority.</p>\n<p>I have written of this presumption elsewhere that it \"has little if any independent legal force beyond what would be dictated by normal principles of contract interpretation. It is simply a rule of presumed (or implied-in-fact) intent.\" <i>United States v. Winstar Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118062\"><a href=\"/opinion/118062/united-states-v-winstar-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 920, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (opinion concurring in judgment). It is a manifestation of the commonsense intuition that a State will rarely contract away its sovereign power. That intuition is sound enough in almost all state dealings with private citizens, and in some state dealings with other States. It has no application here, however, because the whole purpose of the 1905 Compact was precisely to come to a compromise agreement on the exercise of the two States' sovereign powers. Entered into at a time when Delaware and New Jersey disputed the location of their boundary, the Compact demarcated the authority between the two States with respect to service of civil and criminal process on vessels, rights of fishery, and riparian rights on either side of the Delaware River within the circle of a 12-mile radius centered on the town of New Castle, Delaware. See Compact, 34 Stat. 858; <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102211\"><a href=\"/opinion/102211/new-jersey-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 377-378, 54 S.Ct. 407, 78 L.Ed. 847 (1934) <i>(New Jersey v. Delaware II).</i> There is no way the Compact can be interpreted <i>other than</i> as a yielding by both States of what they claimed to be their sovereign powers. The only issue is <i>what</i> sovereign powers were yielded, and that is best determined from the language of the Compact, with no thumb on the scales.</p>\n<p>Besides relying on the presumption, the Special Master believed (and the Court believes) that New Jersey's claims must be viewed askance because it is implausible that Delaware would have \"given up all governing authority over the disputed area while receiving nothing in return.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1422. But Delaware received plenty in return. First of all, it assured access of its citizens to fisheries on the side of the river claimed by New Jersey\u0097something it evidently cared more about than the power to control wharfing out from the Jersey shore, which it had never theretofore exercised. And it obtained (as the Compact observed) \"the amicable termination\" of New Jersey's then-pending original action in the Supreme Court, which had \"been pending for twenty-seven years and upwards.\" 34 Stat. 858-859. How plausible it was that Delaware would give up anything to get rid of that suit surely depends upon how confident Delaware was that it would prevail. And to tell the truth, the case appeared to be going badly. As the Compact observed, the Supreme Court had issued a preliminary injunction against Delaware \"restraining the execution of certain statutes of the State of Delaware relating to fisheries.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 859. The order issuing that injunction had remarked that Delaware had now \"interfered with and claimed to control the right of fishing\" which New Jerseyites had \"heretofore been accustomed\" to exercise without Delaware's interference for over 70 years. Order in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware,</i> No. 1, Orig. (filed 1877), Lodging for Brief of State of Delaware in Opposition to State of New Jersey's Motion to Reopen (Tab 1). By providing for dismissal of New Jersey's suit, the Compact assured Delaware that the Supreme Court's rather ominous sounding preliminary order would not become the Court's holding, perhaps the consequence of a rationale that gave New Jersey jurisdiction in the river.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Article VII of the 1905 Compact between New Jersey and Delaware reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1432</span> \"Each State may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature, and to make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights under the laws of the respective States.\" 34 Stat. 860.</blockquote>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, this provision allocates to each State jurisdiction over a bundle of rights that, at the time of the Compact, riparian landowners, or \"owners of land abutting on bodies of water,\" possessed under the common law \"by reason of their adjacency.\" 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 62, p. 278 (1904) (Farnham). Those riparian rights included the right to \"fill in and to build wharves and other structures in the shallow water in front of [the upland] and below low-water mark.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 113b, at 534. A wharf, the type of structure at issue here, \"imports a place built or constructed for the purpose of loading or unloading goods.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 111, at 520, n. 1. It was considered \"a necessary incident of the right [to construct wharves and piers] that they shall project to a distance from the shore necessary to reach water which shall float vessels, the largest as well as the smallest, that are engaged in commerce upon the water into which they project.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 522. Thus, wharves could be built up to \"the point of navigability,\" J. Gould, Treatise on the Law of Waters, including Riparian Rights \u00a7 181, p. 352 (2d ed. 1891) (Gould), so long as they did not \"interfere needlessly with the right of navigation\" possessed by members of the general public upon navigable waters, 1 Farnham \u00a7 111, at 521.</p>\n<p>The two States would have been acquainted with this common law. New Jersey case law comported with the hornbook rules. According to the State's Court of Errors and Appeals, it was \"undoubted\" and the \"common understanding\" that \"the owners of land bounding on navigable waters had an absolute right to wharf out and otherwise reclaim the land down to and even below low water, provided that they did not thereby impede the paramount right of navigation.\" <i>Bell v. Gough,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.L.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span>, 658 (1852) (opinion of Elmer, J.); see also J. Angell, Treatise on the Right of Property in Tide Waters and in the Soil and Shores Thereof 234 (1847) (\"[T]he right of a riparian proprietor to `wharf out' into a public river, is a local custom in New Jersey\"); Gould \u00a7 171, at 342 (\"[T]he common understanding in [New Jersey] carries the right [to wharf out] even below low-water mark, provided there is no obstruction to the navigation\"). Case authority in Delaware seems to be lacking, but in <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II</i> the State assured the Special Master at oral argument that \"it is undoubtedly true in the State of Delaware . . . that the upland owner had the right to wharf out. . . subject only that you must not . . . obstruct navigation.\" 1 App. of New Jersey on Motion for Summary Judgment 126a-1 (hereinafter NJ App.).</p>\n<p>Thus, under the plain terms of the 1905 Compact, each State had \"jurisdiction\"\u0097the \"authority of a sovereign power to govern or legislate,\" Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language (1898)\u0097over wharfing out on \"its own side of the river.\" To emphasize that this jurisdiction was plenary\u0097that it included, for example, not merely the power to prohibit wharfing out but also the power to permit it\u0097Article VII specified that the jurisdiction it conferred would be \"of every kind and nature.\"</p>\n<p>And finally, the jurisdictional grant was not framed as though it was conferring on either State some hitherto unexercised power. Rather, the Compact provided that each State would <i>\"continue to</i>\" exercise the allocated \"riparian jurisdiction,\" clearly envisioning that each State would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1433</span> wield in the future the same authority over riparian rights it had wielded in the past. 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). This is significant because, before adoption of the Compact in 1905, New Jersey alone had regulated the construction of riparian improvements on New Jersey's side of the Delaware River. It had repeatedly authorized the construction of piers and wharves that extended beyond the low-water line. App. to Report C-4 to C-5 (listing New Jersey Acts authorizing riparian landowners to construct wharves); 7 NJ App. 1196a-1199a. Delaware, by contrast, had never regulated riparian rights on the New Jersey side, and indeed, at the time of the Compact even on its own side there was \"little evidence of [the State's] active involvement in shoreland development. . . .\" Report 69.</p>\n<p>I would think all of this quite conclusive of the fact that New Jersey was given full and exclusive control over riparian rights on the New Jersey side. The Court concludes that this was not so, however, in part because of the alleged implausibility of Delaware's \"giv[ing] up all governing authority . . . while receiving nothing in return,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1422 (a mistaken contention that I have already addressed), and in part because \"riparian jurisdiction\" is different from \"exclusive jurisdiction,\" the term used in an 1834 Compact between New Jersey and New York, which referred to \"the exclusive jurisdiction of and over the wharves, docks, and improvements, made and to be made on the shore . . . .\" Act of June 28, 1834, ch. 126, Art. Third, 4 Stat. 710.</p>\n<p>I willingly concede that exclusive riparian jurisdiction is not the same as \"exclusive jurisdiction\" <i>simpliciter.</i> It includes only exclusive jurisdiction over <i>riparian rights</i> which, as I have described, include the right to erect wharves <i>for the loading and unloading of goods.</i> That jurisdiction does not necessarily include, for example, the power to permit or forbid the construction of a casino on the wharf, or even the power to serve legal process on the wharf. Jurisdiction to control such matters\u0097which were not established as part of riparian rights by the common-law and hornbook sources that the parties relied on in framing the Compact\u0097may well fall outside the scope of the \"riparian jurisdiction\" that the Compact grants. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tewksbury v. Deerfield Beach,</i> 763 So.2d 1071 (Fla.App.1999) (operation of a restaurant on a dock is not included within riparian rights). Such powers\u0097which may well have been conveyed by a grant of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" such as that contained in the New York-New Jersey Compact\u0097are not at issue in this case. What is at issue is jurisdiction over the core riparian right of building a wharf to be used for the loading and unloading of cargo. And that <i>that</i> jurisdiction was given exclusively to New Jersey is made perfectly clear by the Compact's recognition of each State's riparian jurisdiction only \"<i>on its own side of the river.\"</i> 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). It does not take vast experience in textual interpretation to conclude that this implicitly excludes each State's riparian jurisdiction <i>on the other State's side of the river. (Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.)</i> There was no need, therefore, to specify <i>exclusive</i> riparian jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court's position gains no support from the fact that the rights of a private riparian owner \"`are always subordinate to the public rights, and the state may regulate their exercise in the interest of the public.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1421 (quoting 1 Farnham \u00a7 63, at 284). The Compact did not purport to convey mere private rights, but rather \"riparian <i>jurisdiction</i> of every kind and nature.\" If that means anything at all, it means that <i>New Jersey</i> is the State that \"may regulate [the] exercise [of the rights of a private riparian owner] in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1434</span> the interest of the public.\" Delaware's contention that it retains the authority to prohibit under its police power even those activities that are specifically allowed to New Jersey under the Compact renders not just Article VII but most of the Compact a virtual nullity. Article III, for example, gives the States \"common right of fishery throughout, in, and over the waters\" of the Delaware. 34 Stat. 859. But under its police powers a sovereign State could regulate fishing within its public navigable waters. See Gould \u00a7 189, at 362. Thus, under Delaware's view, just as its ownership of the riverbed would allow it to trump New Jersey's authority to permit wharfing out, so also its ownership of the riverbed would allow it to prevent fishing. That would be an extraordinary result, since the litigation the 1905 Compact was designed to resolve arose over fishing rights, after Delaware enacted a law in 1871 requiring New Jersey fishermen to obtain a Delaware license. See Report 3-6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Court, following the Special Master's analysis, see Report 68-84, asserts that today's judgment is supported by the parties' course of conduct after conclusion of the Compact. I frankly think post-Compact conduct irrelevant to this case, since it can properly be used only to clarify an ambiguous agreement, and there is no ambiguity here. The Court, moreover, overstates the post-Compact conduct favoring Delaware's position and understates the post-Compact conduct favoring New Jersey. But even if post-Compact conduct is consulted, no such conduct\u0097none whatever\u0097supports the Court's \"extraordinary character\" test, whereas several instances of such conduct strongly support the resolution I have suggested in this dissent.</p>\n<p>The Court relies upon four instances of Delaware's exercise of jurisdiction over wharfing out from the Jersey shore, and two instances of New Jersey's acquiescence in such an exercise\u0097all postdating 1969. As to the former, the three structures extending from New Jersey into Delaware built between 1969 and 2006 were permitted by Delaware, <i>ante,</i> at 1426; and another application for a permit was denied, <i>ante,</i> at 1425-1426. The Court never establishes, however, that these instances of Delaware's assertion of jurisdiction related to wharves of \"extraordinary character,\" which is the only jurisdiction that the Court's decree confers upon Delaware. At best, these assertions of jurisdiction support not the Court's opinion, but rather Delaware's assertion that it may regulate all wharves on the river\u0097an assertion that the Court rejects. The same mismatch is present with both instances of New Jersey's asserted acquiescence. One of them was New Jersey's application for Delaware's permission to refurbish the stone pier at Fort Mott State Park, described <i>ante,</i> at 1426. That construction could not conceivably be characterized as of \"extraordinary character,\" and thus New Jersey did not need to ask Delaware for permission under the Court's theory. In the other instance, described <i>ante,</i> at 1425-1426, New Jersey's Coastal Management Agency assured the Secretary of Commerce that \"`<i>any</i> New Jersey project extending beyond mean low water'\" (emphasis added) had to be approved by Delaware's Coastal Management Agency as well as New Jersey's. This again supports Delaware's theory of this case, but not the Court's.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1435</span> While post-Compact conduct provides no\u0097absolutely <i>zero</i>\u0097support for the Court's interpretation, it provides substantial support for the one I have suggested. In <i>New Jersey v. Delaware II,</i> a case before this Court involving precisely the meaning of the Compact, the Attorney General of Delaware (obviously authorized to present the State's position on the point) conceded to the Special Master that \"Article VII of the Compact is obviously merely a recognition of the rights of the riparian owners of New Jersey and a <i>cession</i> to the State of New Jersey by the State of Delaware of jurisdiction to regulate those rights.\" 1 NJ App. 123a (emphasis added). And at oral argument before the Special Master, Delaware's Special Counsel\u0097Clarence A. Southerland, a former State Attorney General and future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Delaware, see Delaware Bar in the Twentieth Century 375 (H. Winslow, A. Bookout, &amp; P. Hannigan eds.1994)\u0097explained that \"the Compact of 1905 expressly acknowledged the rights of the citizens of New Jersey, at least, by implication to wharf out\" and that New Jersey possessed \"all the right <i>to control the erection of those wharves and to say who shall erect them.\"</i> 1 NJ App. 126a-1 (emphasis added). And in its Supreme Court brief in that litigation, Delaware assured the Court, without conditions, that \"Delaware has never questioned the right of citizens of New Jersey to wharf out <i>to navigable water</i> nor can such a right be questioned now because it is clearly protected by the Compact of 1905 between the States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 139a (emphasis added). Delaware's Supreme Court brief rejected New Jersey's argument that, if the Court found the boundary line to be the low-water mark on the New Jersey shore, \"the interests of the riparian owners will be either destroyed or seriously prejudiced.\" That concern, Delaware said, was misguided because the 1905 Compact \"recognized the rights of riparian owners in the river to wharf out.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 140a. \"The effect of Article VII of the Compact,\" the brief explained, \"was that the State of Delaware recognized the rights of the inhabitants on the east side of the river to wharf out to navigable water. This right had never been questioned and was undoubtedly inserted to put beyond question the <i>riparian rights</i> (as distinguished from <i>title)</i> of land owners in New Jersey.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 141a. These concessions are powerful indication that Delaware's understanding of the Compact was the same as the one I assert.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Our opinion in <i>Virginia v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131148\"><a href=\"/opinion/131148/virginia-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 598, 157 L.Ed.2d 461 (2003), effectively decided this case. It rejected the very same assertion of a riverbed-owning State's supervening police-power authority over constructions into the river from a State that had been conceded riparian rights. That case involved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1436</span> two governing documents rather than (as here) only one. The first, a 1785 compact, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`The citizens of each state respectively shall have full property in the shores of Potowmack river adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements, so as not to obstruct or injure the navigation of the river.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62, 124 S.Ct. 598.</blockquote>\n<p>The second, an arbitration award of 1877 that interpreted the earlier compact, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over the soil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership, without impeding the navigation or otherwise interfering with the proper use of it by Maryland, agreeably to the compact of seventeen hundred and eighty-five.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62-63, 124 S.Ct. 598.</blockquote>\n<p>We rejected Maryland's police-power authority to forbid Virginia's construction of a water intake structure that extended into Maryland territory, and held that \"Virginia's right `to erect . . . structures connected with the shore' is inseparable from, and `necessary to,' the `full enjoyment of her riparian ownership' of the soil to low-water mark.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598. Maryland, we observed, was \"doubtless correct that if her sovereignty over the River was well settled as of 1785, we would apply a strong presumption against reading the Compact as stripping her authority to regulate activities on the River.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 598. But because the \"scope of Maryland's sovereignty over the River was in dispute both before and after the 1785 Compact,\" no such presumption existed. <i>Id.,</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. 598.</p>\n<p>Today's opinion, quoting the Special Master, claims that the result in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> turned on \"`the unique language of the compact and arbitration award involved in that case.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1424 (quoting Report 64, n. 118). But the case did not say that. And of course virtually every written agreement or award has \"unique language,\" so if we could only extend to other cases legal principles pertaining to identical language our interpretive jurisprudence would be limited indeed. The documents in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> said in other words precisely what the Compact here said: that one of the States (there, Virginia, here, New Jersey) was given riparian rights, including the right to construct wharves and improvements. And the holding of the case was that those rights could be exercised free of police power or other interference by the State owning the riverbed.</p>\n<p>The Court contends that in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> the arbitration award, rather than the compact, \"was definitive,\" because it recognized the right of Virginia \" <i>'qua</i> sovereign,'\" and nowhere made the right \"`subject to Maryland's regulatory authority.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1424 (quoting 540 U.S., at 72, 124 S.Ct. 598). But Article VII of the Compact here at issue likewise spoke of the rights of New Jersey <i>\"qua</i> sovereign\" (what else does the \"exercise [of] riparian <i>jurisdiction</i>\" mean?) and similarly did not make those rights subject to Delaware's regulatory authority. We stressed in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> that the salient factor in the interpretation of the compact (and hence in the arbitration award's interpretation of the compact) was that it was entered into (like the Compact here) by way of settlement of a continuing boundary dispute. \"If any inference at all is to be drawn from [the compact's] silence on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1437</span> the subject of regulatory authority,\" we said, \"it is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 598. <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> effectively decided this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Finally, I must remark at greater length upon the Court's peculiar limitation upon New Jersey's wharfing-out rights\u0097that it excludes wharves of \"extraordinary character.\" But for that limitation, the Court's conclusion is precisely the same as my own: \"Given the authority over riparian rights that the 1905 Compact preserves for New Jersey, Delaware may not impede ordinary and usual exercises of the right of riparian owners to wharf out from New Jersey's shore.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1427. The Court inexplicably concludes, however, that the liquefied natural gas (LNG) unloading wharf at stake in this litigation \"goes well beyond the ordinary or usual.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Why? Because it possesses \"extraordinary character.\"</p>\n<p>To our knowledge (and apparently to the Court's, judging by its failure to cite any authority) the phrase has never been mentioned before in any case involving limitations on wharfing out. What in the world does it mean? Would a pink wharf, or a zig-zagged wharf qualify? Today's opinion itself gives the phrase no content other than to say that \"Delaware's classification of the proposed LNG unloading terminal as a `heavy industry use' and a `bulk product transfer facilit[y],' . . . has not been, and hardly could be, challenged as inaccurate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This rationale is bizarre. There is no reason why <i>any</i> designation by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control would be relevant to, let alone controlling on, the meaning of the 1905 Compact; and no reason why New Jersey's authority under the 1905 Compact should turn on the state-law question whether Delaware \"rationally categorize[s]\" a wharf under its own statutes, <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21. Wharves were commonly used for \"heavy industry use\" when the 1905 Compact was adopted, and their primary commercial use was to transfer bulk cargoes. One roughly contemporaneous book on the design and building of wharves in America included information on appropriate pavement material to enable use of trucks on wharves, the proper method of laying down railroad tracks, and the construction of hatch cranes for unloading cargo. See C. Greene, Wharves and Piers: Their Design, Construction, and Equipment 191-194, 206-215 (1917). The Court gives no reason why the terminal's character as a \"heavy industry use\" and a \"bulk product transfer facilit[y]\" matters in the slightest. Indeed, the Court does not take its state-law reason for \"extraordinary character\" seriously, conceding that Delaware could not regulate an <i>identical</i> wharf for the \"bulk product transfer\" of \"tofu and bean sprouts,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21.</p>\n<p>Apart from the Delaware Department's \"heavy industry use\" and \"bulk product transfer\" designations, the Court cites, as support for its conclusion that this wharf is of \"extraordinary character\" its own factual background section describing the wharf. See <i>ante,</i> at 1427 (citing <i>ante,</i> at 1417-1418). It is not clear which, if any, of the facts discussed there the Court claims to be relevant, and I am forced to speculate on what they might be.</p>\n<p>Could it be the size of the wharf, which is 2,000 feet long, see <i>ante,</i> at 1418, and extends some 1,455 feet into Delaware territory, see Brief for BP America Inc. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 1-2? But the Court cites <i>not a single source</i> for this length limitation upon wharfing out. We did not intimate, in holding in <i>Virginia v. Maryland</i> that Virginia could authorize construction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1438</span> of a water intake pipe extending 725 feet from its shoreline into Maryland, see 540 U.S., at 63, 124 S.Ct. 598, that the result turned on the length of the pipe. As I have discussed, the common law <i>did</i> establish a size limitation for wharves: the wharf could not be extended so far as to interfere needlessly with the public's \"right of navigation\" in navigable waters. 1 Farnham \u00a7 111, at 521. Wharves constructed to access the water could \"project to a distance from the shore necessary to reach water which shall float vessels, <i>the largest as well as the smallest.\" Id.,</i> \u00a7 111, at 522 (emphasis added). Delaware has not claimed that the wharf in this case will interfere with navigation of the river, which is approximately one mile wide at this location, see Brief for BP America Inc. as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2. And the record reveals that New Jersey, at least, anticipated that wharves on its side of the river could extend as far as the wharf in this case by establishing pierhead lines in 1877 and 1916 that extended <i>\"below</i> low water mark at distances varying from 378 to 3,550 feet.\" 1 NJ App. 135a; see also 3 <i>id.,</i> at 376a (affidavit of Richard G. Castagna). (Pierhead lines mark the permissible \"outshore limit of structures of any kind.\" Greene, <i>supra,</i> at 27.)</p>\n<p>Could the fact rendering this a wharf of \"extraordinary character\" be that its construction would require the dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards of soil within Delaware's territory? <i>Ante,</i> at 1418. This is suggested, perhaps, by the portion of the Decree which says that \"Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the . . . soil within the twelve-mile circle.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428; see also <i>ante,</i> at 1418, n. 8. But no again. Although the record contains no evidence of the dredge volumes required to construct the wharves on the river at the time of the Compact's adoption, it does show that an 1896 navigational improvement required the dredging of 35 million cubic yards from the Delaware River, and a 1907 dredging at Cape May Harbor, New Jersey, removed 19.7 million cubic yards. 7 NJ App. 1234a (affidavit of J. Richard Weggel). At the very least, the dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards \"would have been familiar to or ascertainable by individuals interested in riparian uses or structures at the time the Compact was signed or ratified.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1227a. I do not know what to make of the Court's response that the instances of dredging that I have cited involved \"public works.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1418, n. 8. Is that a limitation upon the Court's holding\u0097only <i>private</i> wharves of \"extraordinary character\" can be regulated by Delaware? But in fact dredging seems to have nothing to do with the issue, since (once again) the Court acknowledges that the same wharf for tofu and bean sprouts would be OK.</p>\n<p>Could the determinative fact be that the wharf would service \"[s]upertankers with capacities of up to 200,000 cubic meters (more than 40 percent larger than any ship then carrying natural gas),\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418; that these ships \"would pass densely populated areas\" and require establishment of \"a moving safety zone [that] would restrict other vessels 3,000 feet ahead and behind, and 1,500 feet on all sides,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1418, n. 7? This is suggested, perhaps, by the portion of the Decree which says that \"Delaware acted within the scope of its governing authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river . . . within the twelve-mile circle.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428. But surely not. Whatever power Delaware has to restrict traffic on the waters of the United States (a question not presented by this case, though one that seems not to inhibit the Decree's blithe positing of state \"authority to prohibit unreasonable uses of the river,\" <i>ibid.),</i> it has no bearing on whether New <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1439</span> Jersey can build the <i>wharf</i> without Delaware's interference.</p>\n<p>Could the determinative fact be that the wharf will be used to transport liquefied natural gas, which is dangerous? No again. The Court cites no support, and I am aware of none, for the proposition that the common law forbade a wharf owner to load or unload hazardous goods. At the time of the Compact's adoption, congressional sources reported that the Delaware River was used to transport, among other items, coal tar and pitch, sulfur, gunpowder, and explosives. Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, H.R. Doc. No. 22, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., 1031-1033 (App.H) (1906) (tabulating commerce on the Delaware River by item in 1904 and 1905). Books published some time after the adoption of the Compact discuss the proper handling of seaborne \"dangerous goods,\" including liquids such as benzene, petroleum, and turpentine. See J. Aeby, Dangerous Goods (2d ed.1922); R. MacElwee &amp; T. Taylor, Wharf Management: Stevedoring and Storage 41, 221 (1921). There is not a shred of evidence that the parties to the Compact understood that New Jersey and Delaware would not be authorized to grant riparian rights for the loading and unloading of goods that are\u0097under some amorphous and unexplained criteria\u0097dangerous.</p>\n<p>I say that none of these factors has any bearing upon whether, at law, the wharfing out at issue here is anything more than the usual and ordinary exercise of a riparian right. I am not so rash as to suggest, however, that these factors had nothing to do with the Court's decision. After all, our environmentally sensitive Court concedes that if New Jersey had approved a wharf of equivalent dimensions, to accommodate tankers of equivalent size, carrying tofu and bean sprouts, Delaware could not have interfered. See <i>ante,</i> at 1427, n. 21.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>According to one study, construction activities on the LNG facility in this case would have created more than 1,300 new jobs, added $277 million to New Jersey's gross state product, and produced $13 million in state and local tax revenues. J. Seneca et al., Economic Impacts of BP's Proposed Crown Landing LNG Terminal 65, online at http://www.policy.rutgers.edu/news/reports/BPCrownLanding.pdf (as visited Mar. 28, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Operation of the facility was projected to generate 231 permanent jobs, and more than $88 million in state and local tax revenues over a 30-year period. <i>Ibid.</i> Its delivery capacity would represent 15 percent of the current consumption of natural gas in the region. <i>Id.,</i> at 66. In holding that Delaware may veto the project, the Court owes New Jersey\u0097not to mention an energy-starved Nation\u0097something more than its casual and unsupported statements that the wharf possesses \"extraordinary character\" and \"goes well beyond the ordinary or usual.\"</p>\n<p>Today's decision does not even have the excuse of achieving a desirable result. If one were to design, <i>ex ante,</i> the socially optimal allocation of the power to permit and forbid wharfing out, surely that power would be lodged with the sovereign that stands most to gain from the benefits of a wharf, and most to lose from its environmental and other costs. Unquestionably, that is the sovereign with jurisdiction over the land from which the wharf is extended. Delaware and New Jersey doubtless realized this when they agreed in 1905 that each of them would have jurisdiction over riparian rights on its own side of the river. The genius of today's decision is that it creates irrationality where sweet reason <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1440</span> once prevailed\u0097straining mightily, against all odds, to assure that the power to permit or forbid \"heavy industry use\" wharves in New Jersey shall rest with Delaware, which has no interest whatever in facilitating the delivery of goods to New Jersey, which has relatively little to lose from the dangerous nature of those goods or the frequency and manner of their delivery, and which may well have an interest in forcing the inefficient location of employment- and tax-producing wharves on its own shore. It makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Under its Decree, \"[t]he Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as it may from time to time deem necessary or desirable to give proper force and effect to this Decree or to effectuate the rights of the parties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1428. This could mean, I suppose, that we can anticipate a whole category of original actions in this Court that will clarify, wharf by wharf, what is a wharf of \"extraordinary character.\" (Who would have thought that such utterly indefinable and unpredictable complexity lay hidden within the words of the Compact?) More likely, however, prospective builders of \"heavy industry use\" wharves from the New Jersey shore\u0097of whatever size\u0097will apply to Delaware and simply go elsewhere if rejected.</p>\n<p>The wharf at issue in this litigation would have been viewed as an ordinary and usual riparian use at the time the two States entered into the 1905 Compact. Delaware accordingly may not prohibit its construction. I respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  A map showing the interstate boundary line is annexed to the Court's Decree. <i>New Jersey v.

The 1905 Compact is codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 52:28-34 to 52:28-45. We find unconvincing New Jersey's contention that its officials were ignorant of the State's own statutes.

So is its reliance upon Article VIII of the Compact, <i>ante,</i> at 1420-1421, 1426-1427\u0097an argument so weak that it deserves only a footnote response. Article VIII provides that nothing in the Compact \"shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State. . . <i>except as herein expressly set forth.\"</i> 34 Stat. 860 (emphasis added). But New Jersey's riparian rights <i>are</i> expressly set forth, so the only question\u0097the one I have addressed above\u0097is what those rights consist of. But accepting the Court's over-reading of Article VIII (which presumably requires each of the riparian rights to be named one by one), it is utterly impossible to see why Article VIII is any more \"expres[s]\" in setting forth New Jersey's authority over wharves that lack \"extraordinary character\" than it is in setting forth her authority over wharves that possess it. Once again, the argument supports not the Court's holding, but rather Delaware's more expansive theory that it may regulate any and all wharves built from the Jersey shoreline. There is, to tell the truth, nothing whatever to support the Court's holding.</p>\n\n</div>",
