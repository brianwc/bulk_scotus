Limits on electioneering communications were upheld in <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). The holding of <i>McConnell</i> rested to a large extent on an earlier case, <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990). <i>Austin</i> had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.</p>\r\n<p>In this case we are asked to reconsider <i>Austin</i> and, in effect, <i>McConnell.</i> It has been noted that \"<i>Austin</i> was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\" <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 490, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) <i>(WRTL)</i> (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We agree with that conclusion and hold that <i>stare decisis</i> does not compel the continued acceptance of <i>Austin.</i> The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether. We turn to the case now before us.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*887</span> Columbia. A three-judge court later convened to hear the cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to this appeal.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12 million. Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled <i>Hillary: The Movie.</i> We refer to the film as <i>Hillary.</i> It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party's 2008 Presidential primary elections. <i>Hillary</i> mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton. <i>Hillary</i> was released in theaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by making it available through video-on-demand.</p>\r\n<p>Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select programming from various menus, including movies, television shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer can watch the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause the program. In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make <i>Hillary</i> available on a video-on-demand channel called \"Elections '08.\" App. 255a-257a. Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small fee to view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make <i>Hillary</i> available to viewers free of charge.</p>\r\n<p>To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for <i>Hillary.</i> Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie's Website address. <i>Id.,</i> at 26a-27a. Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand offering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibitedand still does prohibit corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections. 2 U.S.C. § 441b (2000 ed.); see <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 204, and n. 87, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 249, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) <i>(MCFL).</i> BCRA § 203 amended § 441b to prohibit any \"electioneering communication\" as well. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.). An electioneering communication is defined as \"any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\" that \"refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\" and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. § 434(f)(3)(A). The Federal Election Commission's (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a communication that is \"publicly distributed.\" 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2) (2009). \"In the case of a candidate for nomination for President ... <i>publicly distributed</i> means\" that the communication \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election ... is being held within 30 days.\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a \"separate segregated fund\" (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> § 441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United wanted to make <i>Hillary</i> available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections. It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by § 441b's ban on corporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under § 437g. In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) § 441b is unconstitutional as applied to <i>Hillary;</i> and (2) BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§ 201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to <i>Hillary</i> and to the three ads for the movie.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F.Supp.2d 274 (D.D.C.2008) <i>(per curiam),</i> and then granted the FEC's motion for summary judgment, App. 261a-262a. See <i>id.,</i> at 261a (\"Based on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that the [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See </i><i>Citizen[s] United v. FEC,</i> 530 F.Supp.2d 274 (D.D.C.2008) (denying Citizens United's request for a preliminary injunction)\"). The court held that § 441b was facially constitutional under <i>McConnell,</i> and that § 441b was constitutional as applied to <i>Hillary</i> because it was \"susceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.\" 530 F.Supp.2d, at 279. The court also rejected Citizens United's challenge to BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It noted that \"the Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though the speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 281.</p>\r\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction. 555 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1471, 170 L.Ed.2d 294 (2008). The case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether we should overrule either or both <i>Austin</i> and the part of <i>McConnell</i> which addresses the facial validity of 2 U.S.C. § 441b. See 557 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1732, 170 L.Ed.2d 511 (2009).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>Before considering whether <i>Austin</i> should be overruled, we first address whether Citizens United's claim that § 441b cannot be applied to <i>Hillary</i> may be resolved on other, narrower grounds.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United contends that § 441b does not cover <i>Hillary,</i> as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the film does not qualify as an \"electioneering communication.\" § 441b(b)(2). Citizens United raises this issue for the first time before us, but we consider the issue because \"it was addressed by the court below.\" <i>Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,</i> 513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995); see 530 F.Supp.2d, at 277, n. 6. Under the definition of electioneering communication, the video-on-demand showing of <i>Hillary</i> on cable television would have been a \"cable... communication\" that \"refer[red] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\" and that was made within 30 days of a primary election. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i). Citizens United, however, argues that <i>Hillary</i> was not \"publicly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> distributed,\" because a single video-on-demand transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each separate transmission, in most instances, will be seen by just one householdnot 50,000 or more persons. 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2); see § 100.29(b)(3)(ii).</p>\r\n<p>This argument ignores the regulation's instruction on how to determine whether a cable transmission \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons.\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). The regulation provides that the number of people who can receive a cable transmission is determined by the number of cable subscribers in the relevant area. §§ 100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, <i>Hillary</i> could have been received by 50,000 persons or more.</p>\r\n<p>One <i>amici</i> brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the condition that the communication \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons,\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require \"a plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed by 50,000 or more potential voters\"as opposed to requiring only that the communication is \"technologically capable\" of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5. Whether the population and demographic statistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000 registered votersbut not \"infants, pre-teens, or otherwise electorally ineligible recipients\" would be a required determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in any case where the issue was in doubt. <i>Id.,</i> at 6.</p>\r\n<p>In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the reach of 2 U.S.C. § 441b through this suggested interpretation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this result would require a calculation as to the number of people a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker to criminal sanctions. The First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day. Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech: People \"of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the law's] meaning and differ as to its application.\" <i>Connally v. General Constr. Co.,</i> 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). The Government may not render a ban on political speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption through an amorphous regulatory interpretation. We must reject the approach suggested by the <i>amici.</i> Section 441b covers <i>Hillary.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United next argues that § 441b may not be applied to <i>Hillary</i> under the approach taken in <i>WRTL. McConnell</i> decided that § 441b(b)(2)'s definition of an \"electioneering communication\" was facially constitutional insofar as it restricted speech that was \"the functional equivalent of express advocacy\" for or against a specific candidate. 540 U.S., at 206, 124 S.Ct. 619. <i>WRTL</i> then found an unconstitutional application of § 441b where the speech was not \"express advocacy or its functional equivalent.\" 551 U.S., at 481, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). As explained by THE CHIEF JUSTICE's controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> the functional-equivalent test is objective: \"a court should find that [a communication] is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 469-470, 127 S.Ct. 2652.</p>\r\n<p>Under this test, <i>Hillary</i> is equivalent to express advocacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President. In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by most viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton's character and her fitness for the office of the Presidency. The narrative may contain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is unfit for the Presidency. The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration, Senator Clinton's qualifications and fitness for office, and policies the commentators predict she would pursue if elected President. It calls Senator Clinton \"Machiavellian,\" App. 64a, and asks whether she is \"the most qualified to hit the ground running if elected President,\" <i>id.,</i> at 88a. The narrator reminds viewers that \"Americans have never been keen on dynasties\" and that \"a vote for Hillary is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the White House,\" <i>id.,</i> at 143a-144a.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that <i>Hillary</i> is just \"a documentary film that examines certain historical events.\" Brief for Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie's consistent emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton's candidacy for President. The narrator begins by asking \"could [Senator Clinton] become the first female President in the history of the United States?\" App. 35a. And the narrator reiterates the movie's message in his closing line: \"Finally, before America decides on our next president, voters should need no reminders of ... what's at stakethe well being and prosperity of our nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 144a-145a.</p>\r\n<p>As the District Court found, there is no reasonable interpretation of <i>Hillary</i> other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in <i>McConnell</i> and further elaborated in <i>WRTL,</i> the film qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United further contends that § 441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads. Cf. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619. On what we might call conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by contrast, the viewer selects a program after taking \"a series of affirmative steps\": subscribing to cable; navigating through various menus; and selecting the program. See <i>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,</i> 521 U.S. 844, 867, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997).</p>\r\n<p>While some means of communication may be less effective than others at influencing the public in different contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of communications are to be preferred for the particular type of message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts' own lawful authority. Substantial questions would arise if courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid flux. See <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,</i> 512 U.S. 622, 639, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994).</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First Amendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable. First Amendment standards, however, \"must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (citing <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 269-270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>D</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to § 441b's expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political speech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an alternative to reconsidering <i>Austin,</i> the Government also seems to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, however, would be unavailing.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>MCFL,</i> the Court found unconstitutional § 441b's restrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to nonprofit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose of promoting political ideas, did not engage in business activities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit corporations or labor unions. 479 U.S., at 263-264, 107 S.Ct. 616; see also 11 CFR § 114.10. BCRA's so-called Wellstone Amendment applied § 441b's expenditure ban to all nonprofit corporations. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(c)(6); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 209, 124 S.Ct. 619. <i>McConnell</i> then interpreted the Wellstone Amendment to retain the <i>MCFL</i> exemption to § 441b's expenditure prohibition. 540 U.S., at 211, 124 S.Ct. 619. Citizens United does not qualify for the <i>MCFL</i> exemption, however, since some funds used to make the movie were donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>The Government suggests we could find BCRA's Wellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the statute, and hold that Citizens United's speech is exempt from § 441b's ban under BCRA's Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, § 441b(c)(2). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a backup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone Amendment is invalidated. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 339, 124 S.Ct. 619 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would exempt from § 441b's expenditure ban the political speech of certain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded \"exclusively\" by individual donors and the funds were maintained in a segregated account. § 441b(c)(2). Citizens United would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemption, under its terms as written, because <i>Hillary</i> was funded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argument, the Court would be required to revise the text of <i>MCFL,</i> sever BCRA's Wellstone Amendment, § 441b(c)(6), and ignore the plain text of BCRA's Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, § 441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a <i>de minimis</i> exception to <i>MCFL</i> or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corporate general treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that support candidates. There is no principled basis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> for doing this without rewriting <i>Austin</i>'s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech.</p>\r\n<p>Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view of the language of the statute. In addition to those difficulties the Government's suggestion is troubling for still another reason. The Government does not say that it agrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 3, n. 1 (\"Some courts\" have implied a <i>de minimis</i> exception, and \"appellant would appear to be covered by these decisions\"). Presumably it would find textual difficulties in this approach too. The Government, like any party, can make arguments in the alternative; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative proposal instead of merely suggesting it. This is especially true in the context of the First Amendment. As the Government stated, this case \"would require a remand\" to apply a <i>de minimis</i> standard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9, 2009). Applying this standard would thus require case-by-case determinations. But archetypical political speech would be chilled in the meantime. \"`First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.' \" <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 468-469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963)). We decline to adopt an interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case determinations to verify whether political speech is banned, especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>E</h2>\r\n<p>As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment. See <i>Morse v. Frederick,</i> 551 U.S. 393, 403, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications. Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consideration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p>Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its complaint, which raised a facial challenge to § 441b, even though count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App. 23a (count 3: \"As applied to <i>Hillary,</i> [§ 441b] is unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free expression and association\"). The Government argues that Citizens United waived its challenge to <i>Austin</i> by dismissing count 5. We disagree.</p>\r\n<p>First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that would not prevent the Court from reconsidering <i>Austin</i> or addressing the facial validity of § 441b in this case. \"Our practice `permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has been passed upon. . . .'\" <i>Lebron,</i> 513 U.S., at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 504 U.S. 36, 41, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 118 L.Ed.2d 352 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the District Court addressed Citizens United's facial challenge. See 530 F.Supp.2d, at 278 (\"Citizens wants us to enjoin the operation of BCRA § 203 as a facially unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment right to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*893</span> freedom of speech\"). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it \"would have to overrule <i>McConnell</i>\" for Citizens United to prevail on its facial challenge and that \"[o]nly the Supreme Court may overrule its decisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in <i>Austin</i> or <i>McConnell.</i> Even so, the District Court did \"`pas[s] upon'\" the issue. <i>Lebron, supra,</i> at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961. Furthermore, the District Court's later opinion, which granted the FEC summary judgment, was \"[b]ased on the reasoning of [its] prior opinion,\" which included the discussion of the facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F.Supp.2d 274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to <i>Austin</i> in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (\"<i>Austin</i> was wrongly decided and should be overruled\"); <i>id.,</i> at 30-32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider Citizens United's challenge to <i>Austin</i> and the facial validity of § 441b's expenditure ban.</p>\r\n<p>Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech. All concede that this claim is properly before us. And \"`[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.'\" <i>Lebron, supra,</i> at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>Yee v. Escondido,</i> 503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992); alteration in original). Citizens United's argument that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled is \"not a new claim.\" <i>Lebron,</i> 513 U.S., at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961. Rather, it isat most\"a new argument to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge. The distinction is both instructive and necessary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint. See <i>United States v. Treasury Employees,</i> 513 U.S. 454, 477-478, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (1995) (contrasting \"a facial challenge\" with \"a narrower remedy\"). The parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved its First Amendment challenge to § 441b as applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we cannot easily address that issue without assuming a premisethe permissibility of restricting corporate political speechthat is itself in doubt. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\"[O]nce a case is brought, no general categorical line bars a court from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly `as-applied' cases\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1327-1328. As our request for supplemental briefing implied, Citizens United's claim implicates the validity of <i>Austin,</i> which in turn implicates the facial validity of § 441b.</p>\r\n<p>When the statute now at issue came before the Court in <i>McConnell,</i> both the majority and the dissenting opinions considered the question of its facial validity. The holding and validity of <i>Austin</i> were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*894</span> essential to the reasoning of the <i>McConnell</i> majority opinion, which upheld BCRA's extension of § 441b. See 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391). <i>McConnell</i> permitted federal felony punishment for speech by all corporations, including nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elections. See 540 U.S., at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619. Four Members of the <i>McConnell</i> Court would have overruled <i>Austin,</i> including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined the Court's opinion in <i>Austin</i> but reconsidered that conclusion. See 540 U.S., at 256-262, 124 S.Ct. 619 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 273-275, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 322-338, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia, J.). That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was facilitated by the extensive record, which was \"over 100,000 pages\" long, made in the three-judge District Court. <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 176, 209 (D.D.C.2003) <i>(per curiam) (McConnell I)</i><i>.</i> It is not the case, then, that the Court today is premature in interpreting § 441b \"`on the basis of [a] factually barebones recor[d].'\" <i>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party,</i> 552 U.S. 442, 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (quoting <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 600, 609, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004)).</p>\r\n<p>The <i>McConnell</i> majority considered whether the statute was facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought in <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 546 U.S. 410, 411-412, 126 S.Ct. 1016, 163 L.Ed.2d 990 (2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and the Court confirmed that the challenge could be maintained. Then, in <i>WRTL,</i> the controlling opinion of the Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but also sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would continue to maintain the position that the record in <i>McConnell</i> demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its face. 551 U.S., at 485-504, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> which refrained from holding the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the essential elements of the Court's opinion in <i>McConnell,</i> while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made by the <i>WRTL</i> parties. 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>As noted above, Citizens United's narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for the Court to consider the facial validity of § 441b. Any other course of decision would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by § 441b's prohibitions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the facial validity of § 441b is further supported by the following reasons.</p>\r\n<p>First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position of the Government. As discussed above, see Part II-D, <i>supra,</i> the Government suggests, as an alternative argument, that an as-applied challenge might have merit. This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit corporation involved here may have received only <i>de minimis</i> donations from for-profit corporations and that some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the operation of the statute. The Government also suggests that an as-applied challenge to § 441b's ban on books may be successful, although it would defend § 441b's ban as applied to almost every other form of media <span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> including pamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65-66 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to the uncertainty that § 441b causes. When the Government holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.</p>\r\n<p>Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity to the application of the statutory provision on these points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by some improper interpretation. See Part II-C, <i>supra.</i> It is well known that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks immediately before they are held. There are short timeframes in which speech can have influence. The need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The decision to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A speaker's ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 462, 126 S.Ct. 1016 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (citing <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <i>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC,</i> 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911)). Here, Citizens United decided to litigate its case to the end. Today, Citizens United finally learns, two years after the fact, whether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential primarylong after the opportunity to persuade primary voters has passed.</p>\r\n<p>Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the integrity of the election process. As additional rules are created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably within their reach is chilled. See Part II-A, <i>supra.</i> Campaign finance regulations now impose \"unique and complex rules\" on \"71 distinct entities.\" Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11-12. These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different types of political speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 14-15, n. 10. The FEC has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanations and justifications for those regulations, and 1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See <i>id.,</i> at 6, n. 7. In fact, after this Court in <i>WRTL</i> adopted an objective \"appeal to vote\" test for determining whether a communication was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement <i>WRTL</i>'s ruling. See 11 CFR § 114.15; Brief for Wyoming Liberty Group et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-27 (filed Jan. 15, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf. <i>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,</i> 283 U.S. 697, 712-713, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the regulations and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2 U.S.C. § 437f; 11 CFR § 112.1. These onerous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> restrictions thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit. See <i>Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist.,</i> 534 U.S. 316, 320, 122 S.Ct. 775, 151 L.Ed.2d 783 (2002); <i>Lovell v. City of Griffin,</i> 303 U.S. 444, 451-452, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938); <i>Near, supra,</i> at 713-714, 51 S.Ct. 625. Because the FEC's \"business is to censor, there inheres the danger that [it] may well be less responsive than a courtpart of an independent branch of governmentto the constitutionally protected interests in free expression.\" <i>Freedman v. Maryland,</i> 380 U.S. 51, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965). When the FEC issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, \"[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speechharming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.\" <i>Virginia v. Hicks,</i> 539 U.S. 113, 119, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003) (citation omitted). Consequently, \"the censor's determination may in practice be final.\" <i>Freedman, supra,</i> at 58, 85 S.Ct. 734.</p>\r\n<p>This is precisely what <i>WRTL</i> sought to avoid. <i>WRTL</i> said that First Amendment standards \"must eschew `the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,' which `invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.'\" 551 U.S., at 469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 527, 547, 115 S.Ct. 1043, 130 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1995); alteration in original). Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question. Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of speech.</p>\r\n<p>The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated. See <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 482-483, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (ALITO, J., concurring); <i>Thornhill v. Alabama,</i> 310 U.S. 88, 97-98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940). For these reasons we find it necessary to reconsider <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>III</h2>\r\n<p>The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\" Laws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process. The following are just a few examples of restrictions that have been attempted at different stages of the speech processall laws found to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the outset, <i>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N.Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton,</i> 536 U.S. 150, 153, 122 S.Ct. 2080, 153 L.Ed.2d 205 (2002); imposing a burden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties, <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,</i> 502 U.S. 105, 108, 123, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991); seeking to exact a cost after the speech occurs, <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S., at 267, 84 S.Ct. 710; and subjecting the speaker to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*897</span> criminal penalties, <i>Brandenburg v. Ohio,</i> 395 U.S. 444, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\r\n<p>The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporationsincluding nonprofit advocacy corporationseither to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under § 441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate's defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.</p>\r\n<p>Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 330-333, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from § 441b's expenditure ban, § 441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak. Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speakand it does notthe option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with § 441b. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within 10 days. See <i>id.,</i> at 330-332, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 253-254, 107 S.Ct. 616).</p>\r\n<p>And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is about to occur:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"`These reports must contain information regarding the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of receipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identification of each political committee and candidate's authorized or affiliated committee making contributions, and any persons making loans, providing rebates, refunds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to operating expenditures in an aggregate amount over $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggregating over $200 have been made; persons to whom loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total sum of all contributions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obligations, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.'\" 540 U.S., at 331-332, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 253-254, 107 S.Ct. 616).</blockquote>\r\n<p>PACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs. See Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity 1990-2006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/ 20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income: 2006, Corporation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinafter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns). PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Section 441b's prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \"restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,\" that statute \"necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Were the Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 251, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (Government could repress speech by \"attacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas,\" for \"effective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others\"). If § 441b applied to individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.</p>\r\n<p>Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 14-15, 96 S.Ct. 612 (\"In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential\"). The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment \"`has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\" <i>Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. 214, 223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting <i>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,</i> 401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1971)); see <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 14, 96 S.Ct. 612 (\"Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution\").</p>\r\n<p>For these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are \"subject to strict scrutiny,\" which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \"furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 464, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a categorical matter, see <i>Simon &amp; Schuster,</i> 502 U.S., at 124, 112 S.Ct. 501 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment), the quoted language from <i>WRTL</i> provides a sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case. We shall employ it here.</p>\r\n<p>Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (striking down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too, are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others. See <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 784, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated: Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content.</p>\r\n<p>Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.</p>\r\n<p>The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but these rulings were based on an interest in allowing governmental entities to perform their functions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser,</i> 478 U.S. 675, 683, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986) (protecting the \"function of public school education\"); <i>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.,</i> 433 U.S. 119, 129, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977) (furthering \"the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 759, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (ensuring \"the capacity of the Government to discharge its [military] responsibilities\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers,</i> 413 U.S. 548, 557, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973) (\"[F]ederal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service\"). The corporate independent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are inapposite. These precedents stand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech. By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes. At least before <i>Austin,</i> the Court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.</p>\r\n<p>We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>1</h2>\r\n<p>The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 778, n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (citing <i>Linmark Associates, Inc. v.

Under the rationale of these precedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection \"simply because its source is a corporation.\" <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 784, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal.,</i> 475 U.S. 1, 8, 106 S.Ct. 903, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (\"The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether speech is protected. Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the `discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas' that the First Amendment seeks to foster\" (quoting <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 783, 98 S.Ct. 1407)). The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not \"natural persons.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 776, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see <i>id.,</i> at 780, n. 16, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 828, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\r\n<p>At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws of some States and of the United States imposed a ban on corporate direct contributions to candidates. See B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 23 (2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress first prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and labor unions in § 304 of the Labor Management Relations Act 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U.S.C. § 251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)). In passing this Act Congress overrode the veto of President Truman, who warned that the expenditure ban was a \"dangerous intrusion on free speech.\" Message from the President of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 334, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).</p>\r\n<p>For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and union expenditures are constitutional. See <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 502, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in the background of <i>United States v. CIO,</i> 335 U.S. 106, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional candidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that \"the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the federal expenditure prohibition's] constitutionality\" if it were construed to suppress that writing. <i>Id.,</i> at 121, 68 S.Ct. 1349. The Court engaged in statutory interpretation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> and found the statute did not cover the publication. <i>Id.,</i> at 121-122, and n. 20, 68 S.Ct. 1349. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Management Relations Act's expenditure ban. <i>Id.,</i> at 155, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ., concurring in result). The concurrence explained that any \"`undue influence' \" generated by a speaker's \"large expenditures\" was outweighed \"by the loss for democratic processes resulting from the restrictions upon free and full public discussion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 143, 68 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S. 567, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957), the Court again encountered the independent expenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U.S.C. § 610 (1952 ed.). See 62 Stat. 723-724. After holding only that a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates was covered by the statute, the Court \"[r]efus[ed] to anticipate constitutional questions\" and remanded for the trial to proceed. 352 U.S., at 591, 77 S.Ct. 529. Three Justices dissented, arguing that the Court should have reached the constitutional question and that the ban on independent expenditures was unconstitutional:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Under our Constitution it is We The People who are sovereign. The people have the final say. The legislators are their spokesmen. The people determine through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is therefore importantvitally importantthat all channels of communications be open to them during every election, that no point of view be restrained or barred, and that the people have access to the views of every group in the community.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 77 S.Ct. 529 (opinion of Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C.J., and Black, J.).</blockquote>\r\n<p>The dissent concluded that deeming a particular group \"too powerful\" was not a \"justificatio[n] for withholding First Amendment rights from any grouplabor or corporate.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 597, 77 S.Ct. 529. The Court did not get another opportunity to consider the constitutional question in that case; for after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty. See Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421, 463 (2008).</p>\r\n<p>Later, in <i>Pipefitters v. United States,</i> 407 U.S. 385, 400-401, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expenditure of union funds for political speechagain without reaching the constitutional question. The Court would not resolve that question for another four years.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2</h2>\r\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, the Court addressed various challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created 18 U.S.C. § 608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265, an independent expenditure ban separate from § 610 that applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions, <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 23, 39, and n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>Before addressing the constitutionality of § 608(e)'s independent expenditure ban, <i>Buckley</i> first upheld § 608(b), FECA's limits on direct contributions to candidates. The <i>Buckley</i> Court recognized a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest in \"the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>id.,</i> at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612. This followed from the Court's concern that large contributions could be given \"to secure a political <i>quid pro quo.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>The <i>Buckley</i> Court explained that the potential for <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption distinguished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> direct contributions to candidates from independent expenditures. The Court emphasized that \"the independent expenditure ceiling . . . fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\" <i>id.,</i> at 47-48, 96 S.Ct. 612, because \"[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate,\" <i>id.,</i> at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Buckley</i> invalidated § 608(e)'s restrictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice dissenting. See <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> 470 U.S. 480, 491, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455, n. 3 (1985) <i>(NCPAC).</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Buckley</i> did not consider § 610's separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition that had also been in the background in <i>CIO, Automobile Workers,</i> and <i>Pipefitters.</i> Had § 610 been challenged in the wake of <i>Buckley,</i> however, it could not have been squared with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 487, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\"<i>Buckley</i> might well have been the last word on limitations on independent expenditures\"); <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 683, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The expenditure ban invalidated in <i>Buckley,</i> § 608(e), applied to corporations and unions, 424 U.S., at 23, 39, n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612; and some of the prevailing plaintiffs in <i>Buckley</i> were corporations, <i>id.,</i> at 8., 96 S.Ct. 612 The <i>Buckley</i> Court did not invoke the First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine, see <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), to suggest that § 608(e)'s expenditure ban would have been constitutional if it had applied only to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U.S., at 50, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Buckley</i> cited with approval the <i>Automobile Workers</i> dissent, which argued that § 610 was unconstitutional. 424 U.S., at 43, 96 S.Ct. 612 (citing 352 U.S., at 595-596, 77 S.Ct. 529 (opinion of Douglas, J.)).</p>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified § 610's corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U.S.C. § 441b four months after <i>Buckley</i> was decided. See 90 Stat. 490. Section 441b is the independent expenditure restriction challenged here.</p>\r\n<p>Less than two years after <i>Buckley, </i><i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. <i>Bellotti</i> could not have been clearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on corporate independent expenditures related to referenda issues:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"We thus find no support in the First. . . Amendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposition that speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its business or property.. . . [That proposition] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may represent in public debate over controversial issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the subject to justify communication.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>* * * * * *</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 784-785, 98 S.Ct. 1407.</blockquote>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> It is important to note that the reasoning and holding of <i>Bellotti</i> did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint-discriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from speaking.</p>\r\n<p><i>Bellotti</i> did not address the constitutionality of the State's ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under <i>Bellotti</i>'s central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker's corporate identity. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3</h2>\r\n<p>Thus the law stood until <i>Austin. Austin</i> \"uph[eld] a direct restriction on the independent expenditure of funds for political speech for the first time in [this Court's] history.\" 494 U.S., at 695, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). There, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general treasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a specific candidate. Michigan law, however, prohibited corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state office. A violation of the law was punishable as a felony. The Court sustained the speech prohibition.</p>\r\n<p>To bypass <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti,</i> the <i>Austin</i> Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion interest. <i>Austin</i> found a compelling governmental interest in preventing \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391; see <i>id.,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (citing <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-<i>Austin</i> line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity and a post-<i>Austin</i> line that permits them. No case before <i>Austin</i> had held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures for political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. Before <i>Austin</i> Congress had enacted legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the same proposition before this Court. See <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (FEC posited that Congress intended to \"curb the political influence of `those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital'\" (quoting <i>Automobile Workers, supra,</i> at 585, 77 S.Ct. 529)); <i>California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 201, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) (Congress believed that \"differing structures and purposes\" of corporations and unions \"may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process\"). In neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.</p>\r\n<p>In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in § 441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on which <i>Austin</i> and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two other compelling interests support <i>Austin</i>'s holding that corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption interest, see 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see <i>id.,</i> at 674-675, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the three points in turn.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*904</span> 1</h2>\r\n<p>As for <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-48 (Sept. 9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot support § 441b.</p>\r\n<p>If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form. The Government contends that <i>Austin</i> permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communication stemming from a corporation. See Part II-E, <i>supra;</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also <i>id.,</i> at 26-31 (Mar. 24, 2009). If <i>Austin</i> were correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books. The Government responds \"that the FEC has never applied this statute to a book,\" and if it did, \"there would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009). This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.</p>\r\n<p>Political speech is \"indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (footnote omitted); see <i>ibid.</i> (the worth of speech \"does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\"); <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612 (\"[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment\"); <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 597, 77 S.Ct. 529 (Douglas, J., dissenting); <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 154-155, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result). This protection for speech is inconsistent with <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale. <i>Austin</i> sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corporations from obtaining \"`an unfair advantage in the political marketplace'\" by using \"`resources amassed in the economic marketplace.' \" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616). But <i>Buckley</i> rejected the premise that the Government has an interest \"in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 791, n. 30, 98 S.Ct. 1407. <i>Buckley</i> was specific in stating that \"the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns\" could not sustain the governmental prohibition. 424 U.S., at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612. The First Amendment's protections do not depend on the speaker's \"financial ability to engage in public discussion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invalidated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds. See <i>Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2774, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (\"Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, § 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*905</span> the voters' choices\"). The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker's wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker's identity.</p>\r\n<p>Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a further argument, the <i>Austin</i> majority undertook to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that \"[s]tate law grants corporations special advantagessuch as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391. This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech. \"It is rudimentary that the State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 680, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\r\n<p>It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that corporate funds may \"have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (majority opinion). All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech. The First Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker's ideas. See <i>id.,</i> at 707, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\"Many persons can trace their funds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then in the form of dividends, interest, or salary\").</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media corporations. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 283, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (\"The chilling endpoint of the Court's reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press\"). Cf. <i>Tornillo,</i> 418 U.S., at 250, 94 S.Ct. 2831 (alleging the existence of \"vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires\"). Media corporations are now exempt from § 441b's ban on corporate expenditures. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i). Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the largest media corporations have \"immense aggregations of wealth,\" and the views expressed by media corporations often \"have little or no correlation to the public's support\" for those views. <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Thus, under the Government's reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities. There is no precedent for permitting this under the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law now under consideration. There is no precedent supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media corporations and those which are not. \"We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct. 1407); see <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,</i> 472 U.S. 749, 784, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and STEVENS, JJ., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 773, 105 S.Ct. 2939 (White, J., concurring in judgment). With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*906</span> comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.</p>\r\n<p>The law's exception for media corporations is, on its own terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidistortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further, separate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, even though both have the need or the motive to communicate their views. The exemption applies to media corporations owned or controlled by corporations that have diverse and substantial investments and participate in endeavors other than news. So even assuming the most doubtful proposition that a news organization has a right to speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a conglomerate that owns both a media business and an unrelated business to influence or control the media in order to advance its overall business interest. At the same time, some other corporation, with an identical business interest but no media outlet in its ownership structure, would be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the same issue. This differential treatment cannot be squared with the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>There is simply no support for the view that the First Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the suppression of political speech by media corporations. The Framers may not have anticipated modern business and media corporations. See <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 334, 360-361, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Yet television networks and major newspapers owned by media corporations have become the most important means of mass communication in modern times. The First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society's most salient media. It was understood as a response to the repression of speech and the press that had existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press that were imposed in the colonies. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 252-253, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); <i>Grosjean,</i> 297 U.S., at 245-248, 56 S.Ct. 444; <i>Near,</i> 283 U.S., at 713-714, 51 S.Ct. 625. The great debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists over our founding document were published and expressed in the most important means of mass communication of that eranewspapers owned by individuals. See <i>McIntyre,</i> 514 U.S., at 341-343, 115 S.Ct. 1511; <i>id.,</i> at 367, 115 S.Ct. 1511 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). At the founding, speech was open, comprehensive, and vital to society's definition of itself; there were no limits on the sources of speech and knowledge. See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 5 (1967) (\"Any number of people could join in such proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from all sides\"); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787, p. 6 (1969) (\"[I]t is not surprising that the intellectual sources of [the Americans'] Revolutionary thought were profuse and various\"). The Framers may have been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of communication, but that does not mean that those speakers and media are entitled to less First Amendment protection than those types of speakers and media that provided the means of communicating political ideas when the Bill of Rights was adopted.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> interferes with the \"open marketplace\" of ideas protected by the First Amendment. <i>New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres,</i> 552 U.S. 196, 208, 128 S.Ct. 791, 169 L.Ed.2d 665 (2008); see <i>ibid.</i> (ideas \"may compete\" in this marketplace \"without government interference\"); <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 274, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). It permits the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*907</span> Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens. See Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns). Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth. See Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million businesses that belong to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have fewer than 100 employees); M. Keightley, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Business Organizational Choices: Taxation and Responses to Legislative Changes 10 (2009) (more than 75% of corporations whose income is taxed under federal law, see 26 U.S.C. § 301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year). This fact belies the Government's argument that the statute is justified on the ground that it prevents the \"distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.</p>\r\n<p>The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The Government has \"muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 257-258, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). And \"the electorate [has been] deprived of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function.\" <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 144, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result). By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit, the Government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the remedy of \"destroying the liberty\" of some factions is \"worse than the disease.\" The Federalist No. 10, p. 130 (B. Wright ed.1961) (J. Madison). Factions should be checked by permitting them all to speak, see <i>ibid.,</i> and by entrusting the people to judge what is true and what is false.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, from presenting both facts and opinions to the public. This makes <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale all the more an aberration. \"[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and administrative bodies.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (citing <i>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited,</i> 404 U.S. 508, 510-511, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972); <i>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.,</i> 365 U.S. 127, 137-138, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961)). Corporate executives and employees counsel Members of Congress and Presidential administrations on many issues, as a matter of routine and often in private. An <i>amici</i> brief filed on behalf of Montana and 25 other States notes that lobbying and corporate communications with elected officials occur on a regular basis. Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 19. When that phenomenon is coupled with § 441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit corporations cannot raise a voice to object when other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are cooperating with the Government. That cooperation may sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a Government official who uses his or her authority, influence, and power to threaten corporations to support the Government's policies. Those kinds of interactions are often unknown and unseen. The speech that § 441b forbids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and purpose. References to massive corporate treasuries should not mask the real operation of this law. Rhetoric ought not obscure reality.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*908</span> Even if § 441b's expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. See, <i>e.g., WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 503-504, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\"In the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142 million to [26 U.S.C. § 527 organizations]\"). Yet certain disfavored associations of citizensthose that have taken on the corporate formare penalized for engaging in the same political speech.</p>\r\n<p>When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2</h2>\r\n<p>What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court found this interest \"sufficiently important\" to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U.S., at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612. When <i>Buckley</i> examined an expenditure ban, it found \"that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to large direct contributions, <i>Buckley</i> reasoned that they could be given \"to secure a political <i>quid pro quo,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612, and that \"the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained,\" <i>id.,</i> at 27, 96 S.Ct. 612. The practices <i>Buckley</i> noted would be covered by bribery laws, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 201, if a <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement were proved. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 27, and n. 28, 96 S.Ct. 612 (citing <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 519 F.2d 821, 839-840, and nn. 36-38 (CADC 1975) (en banc) <i>(per curiam)</i>). The Court, in consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 260, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm.,</i> 459 U.S. 197, 210, 103 S.Ct. 552, 74 L.Ed.2d 364 (1982) <i>(NRWC).</i> The <i>Buckley</i> Court, nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of corruption. That case did not extend this rationale to independent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.</p>\r\n<p>\"The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>ibid.</i> (independent expenditures have a \"substantially diminished potential for abuse\"). Limits on independent expenditures, such as § 441b, have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government's interest in preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expenditures <span class=\"star-pagination\">*909</span> by for-profit corporations. The Government does not claim that these expenditures have corrupted the political process in those States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-9, n. 5.</p>\r\n<p>A single footnote in <i>Bellotti</i> purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be shown to cause corruption. 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. For the reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. Dicta in <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote suggested that \"a corporation's right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Citing the portion of <i>Buckley</i> that invalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424 U.S., at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612, and a law review student comment, <i>Bellotti</i> surmised that \"Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. <i>Buckley,</i> however, struck down a ban on independent expenditures to support candidates that covered corporations, 424 U.S., at 23, 39, n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612, and explained that \"the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application,\" <i>id.,</i> at 42, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Bellotti</i>'s dictum is thus supported only by a law review student comment, which misinterpreted <i>Buckley.</i> See Comment, The Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and Minority Rights and Remedies, 126 U. Pa. L.Rev. 386, 408 (1977) (suggesting that \"corporations and labor unions should be held to different and more stringent standards than an individual or other associations under a regulatory scheme for campaign financing\").</p>\r\n<p>Seizing on this aside in <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote, the Court in <i>NRWC</i> did say there is a \"sufficient\" governmental interest in \"ensur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth amassed\" by corporations would not \"be used to incur political debts from legislators who are aided by the contributions.\" 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552 (citing <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 579, 77 S.Ct. 529); see 459 U.S., at 210, and n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 552; <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (<i>NRWC</i> suggested a governmental interest in restricting \"the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form\"). <i>NRWC,</i> however, has little relevance here. <i>NRWC</i> decided no more than that a restriction on a corporation's ability to solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct contributions to candidates, did not violate the First Amendment. 459 U.S., at 206, 103 S.Ct. 552. <i>NRWC</i> thus involved contribution limits, see <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 495-496, 105 S.Ct. 1459, which, unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 136-138, and n. 40, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 259-260, 107 S.Ct. 616. Citizens United has not made direct contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\r\n<p>When <i>Buckley</i> identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 296-298, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*910</span> KENNEDY, J.) (citing <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 26-28, 30, 46-48, 96 S.Ct. 612); <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 497, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (\"The hallmark of corruption is the financial <i>quid pro quo:</i> dollars for political favors\"); <i>id.,</i> at 498, 105 S.Ct. 1459. The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics. It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on responsiveness.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 297, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</blockquote>\r\n<p>Reliance on a \"generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 296, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \"`to take part in democratic governance'\" because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 390, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000)).</p>\r\n<p><i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009), is not to the contrary. <i>Caperton</i> held that a judge was required to recuse himself \"when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge's election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2263-2264. The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant's due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. See <i>Withrow v. Larkin,</i> 421 U.S. 35, 46, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). <i>Caperton</i>'s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant's political speech could be banned.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>McConnell</i> record was \"over 100,000 pages\" long, <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 209, yet it \"does not have any direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures,\" <i>id.,</i> at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). This confirms <i>Buckley</i>'s reasoning that independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate. See 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption. The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called \"soft money,\" were made to gain access to elected officials. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 125, 130-131, 146-152, 124 S.Ct. 619; see <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 471-481, 491-506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 842-843, 858-859 (opinion of Leon, J.). This case, however, is about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*911</span> independent expenditures, not soft money. When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3</h2>\r\n<p>The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted interest, like <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the political speech even of media corporations. See <i>supra,</i> at 905-906. Assume, for example, that a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper disagrees with the political views the newspaper expresses. See <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 687, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Under the Government's view, that potential disagreement could give the Government the authority to restrict the media corporation's political speech. The First Amendment does not allow that power. There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders \"through the procedures of corporate democracy.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 794, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see <i>id.,</i> at 794, n. 34, 98 S.Ct. 1407.</p>\r\n<p>Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder-protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissenting shareholder's interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with only single shareholders. As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and explore other regulatory mechanisms. The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>4</h2>\r\n<p>We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U.S.C. § 441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to \"foreign national[s]\"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See <i>Broadrick,</i> 413 U.S., at 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Our precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts us <span class=\"star-pagination\">*912</span> on a course that is sure error. \"Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\" <i>Montejo v. Louisiana,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2088-2089, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009) (overruling <i>Michigan v. Jackson,</i> 475 U.S. 625, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986)). We have also examined whether \"experience has pointed up the precedent's shortcomings.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (overruling <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)).</p>\r\n<p>These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting <i>Austin,</i> which itself contravened this Court's earlier precedents in <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti.</i> \"This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the First Amendment.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 500, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). \"<i>[S]tare decisis</i> is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\" <i>Helvering v. Hallock,</i> 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604 (1940).</p>\r\n<p>For the reasons above, it must be concluded that <i>Austin</i> was not well reasoned. The Government defends <i>Austin,</i> relying almost entirely on \"the quid pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the shareholder interest,\" and not <i>Austin</i>'s expressed antidistortion rationale. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see <i>id.,</i> at 45-46. When neither party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of adhering to that precedent through <i>stare decisis</i> is diminished. <i>Austin</i> abandoned First Amendment principles, furthermore, by relying on language in some of our precedents that traces back to the <i>Automobile Workers</i> Court's flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae;</i> Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts 33-35, 153-157 (1988). See <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257-258, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459); <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 585, 77 S.Ct. 529); <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 500, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (quoting <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, 103 S.Ct. 552); <i>id.,</i> at 208, 103 S.Ct. 552 (\"The history of the movement to regulate the political contributions and expenditures of corporations and labor unions is set forth in great detail in <i>[</i><i>Automobile Workers], supra,</i> at 570-584, 77 S.Ct. 529, and we need only summarize the development here\").</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 176-177, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"Given BCRA's tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26 U.S.C. § 527] organizations will only increase\"). Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.</p>\r\n<p>Rapid changes in technologyand the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*913</span> free expressioncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. See Part II-C, <i>supra.</i> Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 261, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, § 441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a); <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 249, 107 S.Ct. 616. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech.</p>\r\n<p>No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court stated in <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> 501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), reliance interests are important considerations in property and contract cases, where parties may have acted in conformance with existing legal rules in order to conduct transactions. Here, though, parties have been prevented from actingcorporations have been banned from making independent expenditures. Legislatures may have enacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those bans were constitutional. This is not a compelling interest for <i>stare decisis.</i> If it were, legislative acts could prevent us from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfering with our duty \"to say what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\r\n<p>Due consideration leads to this conclusion: <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to the principle established in <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti</i> that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>D</h2>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling <i>Austin</i> \"effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section 203, but also 2 U.S.C. 441b's prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express advocacy.\" Brief for Appellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures are therefore invalid and cannot be applied to <i>Hillary.</i></p>\r\n<p>Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule the part of <i>McConnell</i> that upheld BCRA § 203's extension of § 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. See 540 U.S., at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619. The <i>McConnell</i> Court relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in <i>Austin</i> to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld in <i>Austin,</i> see 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619, and we have found this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This part of <i>McConnell</i> is now overruled.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>IV</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United next challenges BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure provisions as applied to <i>Hillary</i> and the three advertisements for the movie. Under BCRA § 311, televised electioneering communications funded by anyone other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*914</span> \"`______ is responsible for the content of this advertising.'\" 2 U.S.C. § 441d(d)(2). The required statement must be made in a \"clearly spoken manner,\" and displayed on the screen in a \"clearly readable manner\" for at least four seconds. <i>Ibid.</i> It must state that the communication \"is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee\"; it must also display the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or group that funded the advertisement. § 441d(a)(3). Under BCRA § 201, any person who spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year must file a disclosure statement with the FEC. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1). That statement must identify the person making the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the communication was directed, and the names of certain contributors. § 434(f)(2).</p>\r\n<p>Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \"impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612, and \"do not prevent anyone from speaking,\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 201, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court has subjected these requirements to \"exacting scrutiny,\" which requires a \"substantial relation\" between the disclosure requirement and a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest. <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 64, 66, 96 S.Ct. 612 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 231-232, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in \"provid[ing] the electorate with information\" about the sources of election-related spending. 424 U.S., at 66, 96 S.Ct. 612. The <i>McConnell</i> Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA §§ 201 and 311. 540 U.S., at 196, 124 S.Ct. 619. There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements \"`while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 237). The Court therefore upheld BCRA §§ 201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens \"`make informed choices in the political marketplace.'\" 540 U.S., at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I, supra,</i> at 237); see 540 U.S., at 231, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Although both provisions were facially upheld, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a \"`reasonable probability'\" that disclosure of its contributors' names \"`will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 198, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 74, 96 S.Ct. 612).</p>\r\n<p>For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 10-second ads to promote <i>Hillary.</i> Under FEC regulations, a communication that \"[p]roposes a commercial transaction\" was not subject to 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on corporate or union funding of electioneering communications. 11 CFR § 114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations, however, do not exempt those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA §§ 201 and 311. See 72 Fed.Reg. 72901 (2007).</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that the disclaimer requirements in § 311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads. It contends that the governmental interest in providing information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*915</span> any commercial advertisements, including the ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within BCRA's definition of an \"electioneering communication\": They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy. See 530 F.Supp.2d, at 276, nn. 2-4. The disclaimers required by § 311 \"provid[e] the electorate with information,\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 196, 124 S.Ct. 619, and \"insure that the voters are fully informed\" about the person or group who is speaking, <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 76, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 792, n. 32, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (\"Identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected\"). At the very least, the disclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that § 311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts that § 311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of the group's speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected these arguments in <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 230-231, 124 S.Ct. 619. And we now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclosure provisions.</p>\r\n<p>As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, the disclosure requirements in § 201 must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The principal opinion in <i>WRTL</i> limited 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on independent expenditures to express advocacy and its functional equivalent. 551 U.S., at 469-476, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). Citizens United seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA's disclosure requirements. We reject this contention.</p>\r\n<p>The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech. See, <i>e.g., MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 262, 107 S.Ct. 616. In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expenditures even though it invalidated a provision that imposed a ceiling on those expenditures. 424 U.S., at 75-76, 96 S.Ct. 612. In <i>McConnell,</i> three Justices who would have found § 441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA's disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540 U.S., at 321, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and SCALIA, J.). And the Court has upheld registration and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself. <i>United States v. Harriss,</i> 347 U.S. 612, 625, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954) (Congress \"has merely provided for a modicum of information from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose\"). For these reasons, we reject Citizens United's contention that the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United also disputes that an informational interest justifies the application of § 201 to its ads, which only attempt to persuade viewers to see the film. Even if it disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens United says, the information would not help viewers make informed choices in the political marketplace. This is similar to the argument rejected above with respect to disclaimers. Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election. Because the informational <span class=\"star-pagination\">*916</span> interest alone is sufficient to justify application of § 201 to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government's other asserted interests.</p>\r\n<p>Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements can chill donations to an organization by exposing donors to retaliation. Some <i>amici</i> point to recent events in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for Institute for Justice as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13-16; Brief for Alliance Defense Fund as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-22. In <i>McConnell,</i> the Court recognized that § 201 would be unconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a reasonable probability that the group's members would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were disclosed. 540 U.S., at 198, 124 S.Ct. 619. The examples cited by <i>amici</i> are cause for concern. Citizens United, however, has offered no evidence that its members may face similar threats or reprisals. To the contrary, Citizens United has been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation.</p>\r\n<p>Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of corporate democracy, see <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 794, and n. 34, 98 S.Ct. 1407, can be more effective today because modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today. It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress' findings in passing BCRA were premised on a system without adequate disclosure. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 128, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"[T]he public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads\"); <i>id.,</i> at 196-197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 237). With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \"`in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests.\" 540 U.S., at 259, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 261, 107 S.Ct. 616. The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>For the same reasons we uphold the application of BCRA §§ 201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their application to <i>Hillary.</i> We find no constitutional impediment to the application of BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand. And there has been no showing that, as applied in this case, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or expression.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>V</h2>\r\n<p>When word concerning the plot of the movie <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution. See Smoodin, \"Compulsory\" Viewing for Every Citizen: <i>Mr. Smith</i> and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra's Capitol Offense, N.Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under <i>Austin,</i> though, officials could have done more than discourage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> its distributionthey could have banned the film. After all, it, like <i>Hillary,</i> was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress. <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force.</p>\r\n<p>Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the \"purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\" in order to engage in political speech. 2 U.S.C. § 431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election. Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute's purpose and design.</p>\r\n<p>Some members of the public might consider <i>Hillary</i> to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation's course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates. Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make. \"The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 341, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\r\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. The judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\r\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\r\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring.</p>\r\n<p>The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern. Its theory, if accepted, would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long as the newspapers were owned by corporationsas the major ones are. First Amendment rights could be confined to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of our democracy.</p>\r\n<p>The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer. I write separately to address the important principles of judicial restraint and <i>stare decisis</i> implicated in this case.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p>Judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> perform.\" <i>Blodgett v. Holden,</i> 275 U.S. 142, 147-148, 48 S.Ct. 105, 72 L.Ed. 206 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 346-348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice \"`never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'\" <i>United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (quoting <i>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,</i> 113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 28 L.Ed. 899 (1885)).</p>\r\n<p>The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles. <i>Ante,</i> at 892; <i>post,</i> at 936-937 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how these principles apply in this case.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's step-by-step analysis accords with our standard practice of avoiding broad constitutional questions except when necessary to decide the case before us. The majority begins by addressing and quite properly rejectingCitizens United's statutory claim that 2 U.S.C. § 441b does not actually cover its production and distribution of <i>Hillary: The Movie</i> (hereinafter <i>Hillary</i>). If there were a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in Citizens United's favor (and thereby avoiding constitutional adjudication), it would be proper to do so. Indeed, that is precisely the approach the Court took just last Term in <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009), when eight Members of the Court agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds instead of reaching the appellant's broader argument that the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United's statutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group's various constitutional arguments, beginning with its narrowest claim (that <i>Hillary</i> is not the functional equivalent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest claim (that <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990) should be overruled). This is the same order of operations followed by the controlling opinion in <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (<i>WRTL</i>). There the appellant was able to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument because its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional equivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to go on to address the broader claim that <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), should be overruled. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652; <i>id.,</i> at 482-483, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (ALITO, J., concurring). This case is differentnot, as the dissent suggests, because the approach taken in <i>WRTL</i> has been deemed a \"failure,\" <i>post,</i> at 935, but because, in the absence of any valid narrower ground of decision, there is no way to avoid Citizens United's broader constitutional argument.</p>\r\n<p>The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citizens United's claims that I find quite perplexing. It presumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United's narrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack meritotherwise its conclusion that the group should lose this case would make no sense. Despite agreeing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*919</span> that these narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent argues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question of whether <i>Austin</i> remains good law. It even suggests that the Court's failure to adopt one of these concededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority is not \"serious about judicial restraint.\" <i>Post,</i> at 938.</p>\r\n<p>This approach is based on a false premise: that our practice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily broad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obligation faithfully to interpret the law. It should go without saying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right. Thus while it is true that \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\" <i>post,</i> at 937 (internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it <i>is</i> necessary to decide more. There is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication. When constitutional questions are \"indispensably necessary\" to resolving the case at hand, \"the court must meet and decide them.\" <i>Ex parte Randolph,</i> 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United's broader argument that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled, the debate over whether to consider this claim on an asapplied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the point. Citizens United has standingit is being injured by the Government's enforcement of the Act. Citizens United has a constitutional claimthe Act violates the First Amendment, because it prohibits political speech. The Government has a defensethe Act may be enforced, consistent with the First Amendment, against corporations. Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the question before us.</p>\r\n<p>Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no difference of any substance whether this case is resolved by invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to Citizens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rightswould mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win. Likewise, a conclusion that the Act may be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause it is constitutional to prohibit corporate political speechwould similarly govern future cases. Regardless whether we label Citizens United's claim a \"facial\" or \"as-applied\" challenge, the consequences of the Court's decision are the same.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in the same direction: Congress may not prohibit political speech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union. What makes this case difficult is the need to confront our prior decision in <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p>This is the first case in which we have been asked to overrule <i>Austin,</i> and thus it is also the first in which we have had reason to consider how much weight to give <i>stare decisis</i> in assessing its continued validity. The dissent erroneously declares <span class=\"star-pagination\">*920</span> that the Court \"reaffirmed\" <i>Austin</i>'s holding in subsequent casesnamely, <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S. 146, 123 S.Ct. 2200, 156 L.Ed.2d 179 (2003); <i>McConnell</i>; and <i>WRTL. Post,</i> at 956-957. Not so. Not a single party in any of those cases asked us to overrule <i>Austin,</i> and as the dissent points out, <i>post,</i> at 931-932, the Court generally does not consider constitutional arguments that have not properly been raised. <i>Austin</i>'s validity was therefore not directly at issue in the cases the dissent cites. The Court's unwillingness to overturn <i>Austin</i> in those cases cannot be understood as a <i>reaffirmation</i> of that decision.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Fidelity to precedentthe policy of <i>stare decisis</i>is vital to the proper exercise of the judicial function. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\" <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). For these reasons, we have long recognized that departures from precedent are inappropriate in the absence of a \"special justification.\" <i>Arizona v. Rumsey,</i> 467 U.S. 203, 212, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 81 L.Ed.2d 164 (1984).</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, <i>stare decisis</i> is neither an \"inexorable command,\" <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 577, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), nor \"a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\" <i>Helvering v. Hallock,</i> 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604 (1940), especially in constitutional cases, see <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 101, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants. See <i>Plessy v. Ferguson,</i> 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), overruled by <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954); <i>Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C.,</i> 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct. 394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923), overruled by <i>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,</i> 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937); <i>Olmstead v. United States,</i> 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928), overruled by <i>Katz v. United States,</i> 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). As the dissent properly notes, none of us has viewed <i>stare decisis</i> in such absolute terms. <i>Post,</i> at 938-939; see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 274-281, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (urging the Court to overrule its invalidation of limits on independent expenditures on political speech in <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (<i>per curiam</i>)).</p>\r\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is instead a \"principle of policy.\" <i>Helvering, supra,</i> at 119, 60 S.Ct. 444. When considering whether to reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of having constitutional questions <i>decided</i> against the importance of having them <i>decided right.</i> As Justice Jackson explained, this requires a \"sober appraisal of the disadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.\" Jackson, Decisional Law and <i>Stare Decisis,</i> 30 A.B.A.J. 334 (1944).</p>\r\n<p>In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that <i>stare decisis</i> is not an end in itself. It is instead \"the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*921</span> <i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> 474 U.S. 254, 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986). Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional idealthe rule of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration itself departed from the Court's jurisprudence, returning to the \"`intrinsically sounder' doctrine established in prior cases\" may \"better serv[e] the values of <i>stare decisis</i> than would following [the] more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 231, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995); see also <i>Helvering, supra,</i> at 119, 60 S.Ct. 444; <i>Randall, supra,</i> at 274, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Abrogating the errant precedent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better preserve the law's coherence and curtail the precedent's disruptive effects.</p>\r\n<p>Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes the stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its <i>stare decisis</i> effect is also diminished. This can happen in a number of circumstances, such as when the precedent's validity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for decision in future cases, when its rationale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in related areas of law, and when the precedent's underlying reasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot keep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and different justifications to shore up the original mistake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 817, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009); <i>Montejo v. Louisiana,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2088-2089, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009) (<i>stare decisis</i> does not control when adherence to the prior decision requires \"fundamentally revising its theoretical basis\").</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>These considerations weigh against retaining our decision in <i>Austin.</i> First, as the majority explains, that decision was an \"aberration\" insofar as it departed from the robust protections we had granted political speech in our earlier cases. <i>Ante,</i> at 907; see also <i>Buckley, supra</i><i>; </i><i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). <i>Austin</i> undermined the careful line that <i>Buckley</i> drew to distinguish limits on contributions to candidates from limits on independent expenditures on speech. <i>Buckley</i> rejected the asserted government interest in regulating independent expenditures, concluding that \"restrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 790-791, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 295, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). <i>Austin,</i> however, allowed the Government to prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\" in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. <i>Austin</i>'s reasoning wasand remainsinconsistent with <i>Buckley</i>'s explicit repudiation of any government interest in \"equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> was also inconsistent with <i>Bellotti</i>'s clear rejection of the idea that \"speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> protection simply because its source is a corporation.\" 435 U.S., at 784, 98 S.Ct. 1407. The dissent correctly points out that <i>Bellotti</i> involved a referendum rather than a candidate election, and that <i>Bellotti</i> itself noted this factual distinction, <i>id.,</i> at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>post,</i> at 958. But this distinction does not explain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on speech in candidate elections when individuals may not.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the validity of <i>Austin</i>'s rationaleitself adopted over two \"spirited dissents,\" <i>Payne,</i> 501 U.S., at 829, 111 S.Ct. 2597has proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Members of this Court ever since. See, <i>e.g., WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 483, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 247, 264, 286, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinions of SCALIA, THOMAS, and KENNEDY, JJ.); <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163, 164, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (opinions of KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.). The simple fact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of course, insufficient to justify overruling it. But it does undermine the precedent's ability to contribute to the stable and orderly development of the law. In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Courtwhich in this case is squarely asked to reconsider <i>Austin</i>'s validity for the first timeto address the matter with a greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.</p>\r\n<p>Third, the <i>Austin</i> decision is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court's decisions even outside the particular context of corporate express advocacy. The First Amendment theory underlying <i>Austin</i>'s holding is extraordinarily broad. <i>Austin</i>'s logic would authorize government prohibition of political speech by a category of speakers in the name of equalitya point that most scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that the dissent denies. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall's Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L.J. 655, 669 (2009) (<i>Austin</i> \"has been understood by most commentators to be an opinion driven by equality considerations, albeit disguised in the language of `political corruption'\") with <i>post,</i> at 970 (<i>Austin</i>'s rationale \"is manifestly not just an `equalizing' ideal in disguise\").<sup>[2]</sup></p>\r\n<p>It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the Court have relied on <i>Austin</i>'s expansive logic to justify greater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside the original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of candidates running for office. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2780, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (relying on <i>Austin</i> and other cases to justify restrictions on campaign spending by individual candidates, explaining that \"there is no reason that their logicspecifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political processis not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> equally applicable in the context of individual wealth\"); <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619 (extending <i>Austin</i> beyond its original context to cover not only the \"functional equivalent\" of express advocacy by corporations, but also electioneering speech conducted by labor unions). The dissent in this case succumbs to the same temptation, suggesting that <i>Austin</i> justifies prohibiting corporate speech because such speech might unduly influence \"the market for legislation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 975. The dissent reads <i>Austin</i> to permit restrictions on corporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that the corporate form may help individuals coordinate and present their views more effectively. <i>Post,</i> at 975. A speaker's ability to persuade, however, provides no basis for government regulation of free and open public debate on what the laws should be.</p>\r\n<p>If taken seriously, <i>Austin</i>'s logic would apply most directly to newspapers and other media corporations. They have a more profound impact on public discourse than most other speakers. These corporate entities are, for the time being, not subject to § 441b's otherwise generally applicable prohibitions on corporate political speech. But this is simply a matter of legislative grace. The fact that the law currently grants a favored position to media corporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in accepting a theory that would allow government restrictions on their political speech. See generally <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 283-286, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).</p>\r\n<p>These readings of <i>Austin</i> do no more than carry that decision's reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so, they highlight the threat <i>Austin</i> poses to First Amendment rights generally, even outside its specific factual context of corporate express advocacy. Because <i>Austin</i> is so difficult to confine to its factsand because its logic threatens to undermine our First Amendment jurisprudence and the nature of public discourse more broadlythe costs of giving it <i>stare decisis</i> effect are unusually high.</p>\r\n<p>Finally and most importantly, the Government's own effort to defend <i>Austin</i> or, more accurately, to defend something that is not quite <i>Austin</i>underscores its weakness as a precedent of the Court. The Government concedes that <i>Austin</i> \"is not the most lucid opinion,\" yet asks us to reaffirm its holding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9, 2009). But while invoking <i>stare decisis</i> to support this position, the Government never once even <i>mentions</i> the compelling interest that <i>Austin</i> relied upon in the first place: the need to diminish \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of endorsing <i>Austin</i> on its own terms, the Government urges us to reaffirm <i>Austin</i>'s specific holding on the basis of two new and potentially expansive intereststhe need to prevent actual or apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, and the need to protect corporate shareholders. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 8-10, 12-13. Those interests may or may not support the <i>result</i> in <i>Austin,</i> but they were plainly not part of the <i>reasoning</i> on which <i>Austin</i> relied.</p>\r\n<p>To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that <i>Austin</i> did not embrace either of the new rationales it now urges upon us. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (\"The Court did not decide in <i>Austin</i>... whether the compelling interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption provides a constitutionally sufficient justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> for prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds for independent electioneering\"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (\"<i>Austin</i> did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest compelling interest\"); <i>id.,</i> at 61 (\"[The Court:] I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest. This is a new argument. [The Government:] I think that that's fair\"); <i>id.,</i> at 64 (\"[The Court:] In other words, you are asking us to uphold <i>Austin</i> on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted in [the context of limits on political expenditures]. [The Government:] [I]n this particular context, fair enough\").</p>\r\n<p>To be clear: The Court in <i>Austin</i> nowhere relied upon the only arguments the Government now raises to support that decision. In fact, the only opinion in <i>Austin</i> endorsing the Government's argument based on the threat of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption was Justice STEVENS's concurrence. 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The Court itself did not do so, despite the fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument. Moreover, the Court's only discussion of shareholder protection in <i>Austin</i> appeared in a section of the opinion that sought merely to distinguish <i>Austin</i>'s facts from those of <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986). <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 663, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Nowhere did <i>Austin</i> suggest that the goal of protecting shareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing restrictions on First Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>To the extent that the Government's case for reaffirming <i>Austin</i> depends on radically reconceptualizing its reasoning, that argument is at odds with itself. <i>Stare decisis</i> is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones. There is therefore no basis for the Court to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has never accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to support a conclusion reached on different grounds that have since been abandoned or discredited.</p>\r\n<p>Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that justify <i>stare decisis</i> in the first place. It would effectively license the Court to invent and adopt new principles of constitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing its past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those principles have merit on their own. This approach would allow the Court's past missteps to spawn future mistakes, undercutting the very rule-of-law values that <i>stare decisis</i> is designed to protect.</p>\r\n<p>None of this is to say that the Government is barred from making new arguments to support the outcome in <i>Austin.</i> On the contrary, it is free to do so. And of course the Court is free to accept them. But the Government's new arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are not entitled to receive the special deference we accord to precedent. They are, as grounds to support <i>Austin,</i> literally <i>un</i>precedented. Moreover, to the extent the Government relies on new arguments and declines to defend <i>Austin</i> on its own termswe may reasonably infer that it lacks confidence in that decision's original justification.</p>\r\n<p>Because continued adherence to <i>Austin</i> threatens to subvert the \"principled and intelligible\" development of our First Amendment jurisprudence, <i>Vasquez,</i> 474 U.S., at 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, I support the Court's determination to overrule that decision.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>* * *</h2>\r\n<p>We have had two rounds of briefing in this case, two oral arguments, and 54 <i>amicus</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> briefs to help us carry out our obligation to decide the necessary constitutional questions according to law. We have also had the benefit of a comprehensive dissent that has helped ensure that the Court has considered all the relevant issues. This careful consideration convinces me that Congress violates the First Amendment when it decrees that some speakers may not engage in political speech at election time, when it matters most.</p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice ALITO joins, and with whom Justice THOMAS joins in part, concurring.</p>\r\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\r\n<p>I write separately to address Justice STEVENS' discussion of <i>\"Original Understandings,\" post,</i> at 948 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter referred to as the dissent). This section of the dissent purports to show that today's decision is not supported by the original understanding of the First Amendment. The dissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment. It never shows why \"the freedom of speech\" that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form. To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations could pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters; but the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in the pursuit of those objectives could be censored.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of taking this straightforward approach to determining the Amendment's meaning, the dissent embarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers' views about the \"role of corporations in society.\" <i>Post,</i> at 949. The Framers didn't like corporations, the dissent concludes, and therefore it follows (as night the day) that corporations had no rights of free speech. Of course the Framers' personal affection or disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected in the understood meaning of the text they enactednot, as the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for that text. But the dissent's distortion of proper analysis is even worse than that. Though faced with a constitutional text that makes no distinction between types of speakers, the dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated statement from the founding era to the effect that corporations are <i>not</i> covered, but places the burden on petitioners to bring forward statements showing that they <i>are</i> (\"there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,\" <i>post,</i> at 948).</p>\r\n<p>Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent has dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the 18th century corporations were despised. If so, how came there to be so many of them? The dissent's statement that there were few business corporations during the eighteenth century\"only a few hundred during all of the 18th century\"is misleading. <i>Post,</i> at 949, n. 53. There were approximately 335 charters issued to business corporations in the United States by the end of the 18th century.<sup>[2]</sup> See 2 J. &amp; Davis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*926</span> Essays in the Earlier History of American Corporations 24 (1917) (reprint 2006) (hereinafter Davis). This was a \"considerable extension of corporate enterprise in the field of business,\" Davis 8, and represented \"unprecedented growth,\" <i>id.,</i> at 309. Moreover, what seems like a small number by today's standards surely does not indicate the relative importance of corporations when the Nation was considerably smaller. As I have previously noted, \"[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life.\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 256, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting C. Cooke, Corporation Trust and Company 92 (1951) (hereinafter Cooke)).</p>\r\n<p>Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent's approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion. Most of the Founders' resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed.<sup>[3]</sup> Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Foundersexcluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society. Moreover, if the Founders' specific intent with respect to corporations is what matters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders' views about other legal entities that have more in common with modern business corporations than the founding-era corporations? At the time of the founding, religious, educational, and literary corporations were incorporated under general incorporation statutes, much as business corporations are today.<sup>[4]</sup> See Davis 16-17; R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784-1855, p. 5 (1982); Cooke 94. There were also small unincorporated business associations, which some have argued were the \"`true progenitors'\" of today's business corporations. Friedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American Land Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Development 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33. Were all of these silently excluded from the protections of the First Amendment?</p>\r\n<p>The lack of a textual exception for speech by corporations cannot be explained on the ground that such organizations did not exist or did not speak. To the contrary, colleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds had long been organized as corporations at common law and under the King's charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 455-473 (1765); 1 S. Kyd, A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*927</span> Treatise on the Law of Corporations 1-32, 63 (1793) (reprinted 2006), and as I have discussed, the practice of incorporation only expanded in the United States. Both corporations and voluntary associations actively petitioned the Government and expressed their views in newspapers and pamphlets. For example: An antislavery Quaker corporation petitioned the First Congress, distributed pamphlets, and communicated through the press in 1790. W. diGiacomantonio, \"For the Gratification of a Volunteering Society\": Antislavery and Pressure Group Politics in the First Federal Congress, 15 J. Early Republic 169 (1995). The New York Sons of Liberty sent a circular to colonies farther south in 1766. P. Maier, From Resistance to Revolution 79-80 (1972). And the Society for the Relief and Instruction of Poor Germans circulated a biweekly paper from 1755 to 1757. Adams, The Colonial German-language Press and the American Revolution, in The Press &amp; the American Revolution 151, 161-162 (B. Bailyn &amp; J. Hench eds.1980). The dissent offers no evidencenone whateverthat the First Amendment's unqualified text was originally understood to exclude such associational speech from its protection.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Historical evidence relating to the textually similar clause \"the freedom of ... the press\" also provides no support for the proposition that the First Amendment excludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope of its protection. The freedom of \"the press\" was widely understood to protect the publishing activities of individual editors and printers. See <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 334, 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 252-253, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But these individuals often acted through newspapers, which (much like corporations) had their own names, outlived the individuals who had founded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes owned by more than one person, and were operated for profit. See generally F. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*928</span> Mott, American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through 250 Years 3-164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom's Fetters (1956). Their activities were not stripped of First Amendment protection simply because they were carried out under the banner of an artificial legal entity. And the notion which follows from the dissent's view, that modern newspapers, since they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only at the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court's conception of corruption is unhistorical. The Framers \"would have been appalled,\" it says, by the evidence of corruption in the congressional findings supporting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. <i>Post,</i> at 963. For this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article arguing that \"corruption\" was originally understood to include \"moral decay\" and even actions taken by citizens in pursuit of private rather than public ends. Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.Rev. 341, 373, 378 (2009). It is hard to see how this has anything to do with what sort of corruption can be combated by restrictions on political speech. Moreover, if speech can be prohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads to \"moral decay\" or does not serve \"public ends,\" then there is no limit to the Government's censorship power.</p>\r\n<p>The dissent says that when the Framers \"constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.\" <i>Post,</i> at 950. That is no doubt true. All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and womennot, for example, of trees or polar bears. But the individual person's right to speak includes the right to speak <i>in association with other individual persons.</i> Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of \"an individual American.\" It is the speech of many individual Americans, who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party the right to speak on their behalf. The association of individuals in a business corporation is no differentor at least it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not \"an individual American.\"<sup>[7]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*929</span> But to return to, and summarize, my principal point, which is the conformity of today's opinion with the original meaning of the First Amendment. The Amendment is written in terms of \"speech,\" not speakers. Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individualsand the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion. We are therefore simply left with the question whether the speech at issue in this case is \"speech\" covered by the First Amendment. No one says otherwise. A documentary film critical of a potential Presidential candidate is core political speech, and its nature as such does not change simply because it was funded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that funding produce any reduction whatever in the \"inherent worth of the speech\" and \"its capacity for informing the public,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy. We should celebrate rather than condemn the addition of this speech to the public debate.</p>\r\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG, Justice BREYER, and Justice SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\r\n<p>The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, the appellant may finance its electioneering. Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets. Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and promote <i>Hillary: The Movie</i> wherever and whenever it wanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast <i>Hillary</i> at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election. Neither Citizens United's nor any other corporation's speech has been \"banned,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886. All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period. The notion that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided. Even more misguided is the notion that the Court must rewrite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*930</span> the law relating to campaign expenditures by <i>for-profit</i> corporations and unions to decide this case.</p>\r\n<p>The basic premise underlying the Court's ruling is its iteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker's identity, including its \"identity\" as a corporation. While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court's disposition of this case.</p>\r\n<p>In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or run for office. Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864. We have unanimously concluded that this \"reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process,\" <i>FEC v. National Right to Work Comm.,</i> 459 U.S. 197, 209, 103 S.Ct. 552, 74 L.Ed.2d 364 (1982) <i>(NRWC),</i> and have accepted the \"legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation,\" <i>id.,</i> at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552. The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990). Relying largely on individual dissenting opinions, the majority blazes through our precedents, overruling or disavowing a body of case law including <i>FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) <i>(WRTL), </i><i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), <i>FEC v.

FEC,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981).</p>\r\n<p>In his landmark concurrence in <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 346, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936), Justice Brandeis stressed the importance of adhering to rules the Court has \"developed ... for its own governance\" when deciding constitutional questions. Because departures from those rules always enhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of this case in some detail before explaining why the Court's analysis rests on a faulty understanding of <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*931</span> of our campaign finance jurisprudence more generally.<sup>[1]</sup> I regret the length of what follows, but the importance and novelty of the Court's opinion require a full response. Although I concur in the Court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions and join Part IV of its opinion, I emphatically dissent from its principal holding.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p>The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution. Before turning to the question whether to overrule <i>Austin</i> and part of <i>McConnell,</i> it is important to explain why the Court should not be deciding that question.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Scope of the Case</i></h2>\r\n<p>The first reason is that the question was not properly brought before us. In declaring § 203 of BCRA facially unconstitutional on the ground that corporations' electoral expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently than those of individuals, the majority decides this case on a basis relinquished below, not included in the questions presented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in response to the Court's invitation. This procedure is unusual and inadvisable for a court.<sup>[2]</sup> Our colleagues' suggestion that \"we are asked to reconsider <i>Austin</i> and, in effect, <i>McConnell,\" ante,</i> at 886, would be more accurate if rephrased to state that \"we have asked ourselves\" to reconsider those cases.</p>\r\n<p>In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of § 203. App. 23a-24a. In its motion for summary judgment, however, Citizens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge, 1:07-cv-2240-RCL-RWR, Docket Entry No. 52, pp. 1-2 (May 16, 2008), and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of that claim, <i>id.,</i> Nos. 53 (May 22, 2008), 54 (May 23, 2008), App. 6a. The District Court therefore resolved the case on alternative grounds,<sup>[3]</sup> and in its jurisdictional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*932</span> statement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised us that it was raising only \"an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of ... BCRA § 203.\" Juris. Statement 5. The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited <i>Austin,</i> the key case the majority today overrules. And not one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to § 203 that it previously agreed to dismiss. In fact, not one of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens United's corporate status. Juris. Statement (i). Moreover, even in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected its request to overrule <i>Austin,</i> it never sought a declaration that § 203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corporations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute could not be applied to it because it was \"funded overwhelmingly by individuals.\" Brief for Appellant 29; see also <i>id.,</i> at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming \"as applied\" character of challenge to § 203); Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-9 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United conceding that § 203 could be applied to General Motors); <i>id.,</i> at 55 (counsel for Citizens United stating that \"we accept the Court's decision in <i>Wisconsin Right to Life</i>\").</p>\r\n<p>\"`It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed,' \" <i>Youakim v. Miller,</i> 425 U.S. 231, 234, 96 S.Ct. 1399, 47 L.Ed.2d 701 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i> (quoting <i>Duignan v. United States,</i> 274 U.S. 195, 200, 47 S.Ct. 566, 71 L.Ed. 996 (1927)), and it is \"only in the most exceptional cases\" that we will consider issues outside the questions presented, <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> 428 U.S. 465, 481, n. 15, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). The appellant in this case did not so much as assert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the majority opinion in vain for the mention of any. That is unsurprising, for none exists.</p>\r\n<p>Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step, but it did not cure this fundamental problem. Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>As-Applied and Facial Challenges</i></h2>\r\n<p>This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years that \"[f]acial challenges are disfavored.\" <i>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party,</i> 552 U.S. 442, 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008); see also <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006) (\"[T]he `normal rule' is that `partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,' such that a `statute may ... be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact'\" (quoting <i>Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U.S. 491, 504, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985); alteration in original)). By declaring § 203 facially unconstitutional, our colleagues have turned an as-applied challenge into a facial challenge, in defiance of this principle.</p>\r\n<p>This is not merely a technical defect in the Court's decision. The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry \"run[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*933</span> that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\" <i>Washington State Grange,</i> 552 U.S., at 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted). Scanting that principle \"threaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 451, 128 S.Ct. 1184. These concerns are heightened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the legislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress' most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics. It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well.</p>\r\n<p>The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of this on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA § 203 can be applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed, through the normal process of litigation, a record about the <i>actual</i> effects of § 203, its actual burdens and its actual benefits, on <i>all</i> manner of corporations and unions.<sup>[4]</sup> \"Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,\" and consequently \"raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is nonexistent. Congress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert. The Court now negates Congress' efforts without a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority throws up its hands. Were we to confine our inquiry to Citizens United's as-applied challenge, it protests, we would commence an \"extended\" process of \"draw[ing], and then redraw[ing], constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*934</span> lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 891. While tacitly acknowledging that some applications of § 203 might be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a future in which novel First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad hoc basis, and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal restraint. Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies, may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins. The fluid nature of electioneering communications does not make this case special. The fact that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some point down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied problems, does not come close to meeting the standard for a facial challenge.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority proposes several other justifications for the sweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because, if the Court were to continue on its normal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they present themselves, that process would itself run afoul of the First Amendment. See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 890 (as-applied review process \"would raise questions as to the courts' own lawful authority\"); <i>ibid.</i> (\"Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment\"). This suggestion is perplexing. Our colleagues elsewhere trumpet \"our duty `to say what the law is,'\" even when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differently. <i>Ante,</i> at 913 (quoting <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). We do not typically say what the law <i>is not</i> as a hedge against future judicial error. The possibility that later courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that provision.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech. See <i>ante,</i> at 890-891, 892, 894-897. In addition to begging the question what types of corporate spending are constitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim rests on the assertion that some significant number of corporations have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*935</span> been cowed into quiescence by FEC \"`censor[ship].'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895-896. That assertion is unsubstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experience. It is particularly hard to square with the legal landscape following <i>WRTL,</i> which held that a corporate communication could be regulated under § 203 only if it was \"susceptible of <i>no</i> reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (emphasis added). The whole point of this test was to make § 203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election cycle, it has determined THE CHIEF JUSTICE's project to be a failure. In this respect, too, the majority's critique of line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied review method generally.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless preserved itnot as a freestanding \"claim,\" but as a potential argument in support of \"a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892-893; see also <i>ante,</i> at 919 (ROBERTS, C.J., concurring) (describing Citizens United's claim as: \"[T]he Act violates the First Amendment\"). By this novel logic, virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as \"a claim that the Government has violated my rights,\" and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim's disposition. Not only the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic relationship between litigants and courts, would be upended if the latter had free rein to construe the former's claims at such high levels of generality. There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the rest to us.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of Citizens United's claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is necessary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review article, it asserts that Citizens United's dismissal of the facial challenge does not prevent us \"`from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \"as-applied\" cases.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 893 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon)); accord, <i>ante,</i> at 919 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (\"Regardless whether we label Citizens United's claim a `facial' or `as-applied' challenge, the consequences of the Court's decision are the same\"). The majority is on firmer conceptual ground here. Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor Fallon's thesis, one must proceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*936</span> to ask <i>which</i> as-applied challenges, if successful, will \"properly\" invite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute.<sup>[10]</sup> The paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as this carries the necessary implication that all future as-applied challenges to the provision must prevail. See Fallon 1339-1340.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United's as-applied challenge was not of this sort. Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention was that BCRA § 203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature-length video-on-demand film (such as <i>Hillary</i>) or to a nonprofit corporation exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4)<sup>[11]</sup> and funded overwhelmingly by individuals (such as itself). See Brief for Appellant 16-41. Success on either of these claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the validity of § 203 as applied to other types of broadcasts, other types of corporations, or unions. It certainly would not invalidate the statute as applied to a large for-profit corporation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is \"a small, nonprofit organization, which is very much like [an <i>MCFL</i> corporation],\" and affirming that its argument \"definitely would not be the same\" if <i>Hillary</i> were distributed by General Motors).<sup>[12]</sup> There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Narrower Grounds</i></h2>\r\n<p>It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*937</span> United, without toppling statutes and precedents. Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another \"cardinal\" principle of the judicial process: \"[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\" <i>PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,</i> 362 F.3d 786, 799 (C.A.D.C.2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\r\n<p>Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision that the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify as an \"electioneering communication\" under § 203 of BCRA, 2 U.S.C. § 441b. BCRA defines that term to encompass certain communications transmitted by \"broadcast, cable, or satellite.\" § 434(f)(3)(A). When Congress was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very different sort of programming: short advertisements run on television or radio. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619. The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC's implementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on-demand transmissions. See Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-19. In light of this ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on-demand, and \"[t]he elementary rule ... that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\" <i>Hooper v. California,</i> 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895), the Court could have reasonably ruled that § 203 does not apply to <i>Hillary.</i><sup>[13]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Second, the Court could have expanded the <i>MCFL</i> exemption to cover § 501(c)(4) nonprofits that accept only a <i>de minimis</i> amount of money from for-profit corporations. Citizens United professes to be such a group: Its brief says it \"is funded predominantly by donations from individuals who support [its] ideological message.\" Brief for Appellant 5. Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that <i>de minimis</i> business support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise qualifying organization from the ambit of <i>MCFL.</i><sup>[14]</sup> This Court could have simply followed their lead.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Finally, let us not forget Citizens United's as-applied constitutional challenge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*938</span> Precisely because Citizens United looks so much like the <i>MCFL</i> organizations we have exempted from regulation, while a feature-length video-on-demand film looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation, this challenge is a substantial one. As the appellant's own arguments show, the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must always be treated identicallyand always spared expenditures restrictionsin the political realm. Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review process that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation since <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329.</p>\r\n<p>This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case could have been decided is not meant to show that any of these grounds is ideal, though each is perfectly \"valid,\" <i>ante,</i> at 892 (majority opinion).<sup>[16]</sup> It is meant to show that there were principled, narrower paths that a Court that was serious about judicial restraint could have taken. There was also the straightforward path: applying <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> just as the District Court did in holding that the funding of Citizens United's film can be regulated under them. The only thing preventing the majority from affirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower ground that would retain <i>Austin,</i> is its disdain for <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is the most transparent: <i>stare decisis.</i> I am not an absolutist when it comes to <i>stare decisis,</i> in the campaign finance area or in any other. No one is. But if this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law, it must at least demand a significant justification, beyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning settled doctrine. \"[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). No such justification exists in this case, and to the contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our precedents.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Court's central argument for why <i>stare decisis</i> ought to be trumped is that it does not like <i>Austin.</i> The opinion \"was not well reasoned,\" our colleagues assert, and it conflicts with First Amendment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*939</span> principles. <i>Ante,</i> at 912. This, of course, is the Court's merits argument, the many defects in which we will soon consider. I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it. But neither is true of <i>Austin,</i> as I explain at length in Parts III and IV, <i>infra,</i> at 942-979, and restating a merits argument with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in the <i>stare decisis</i> calculus.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supplements its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The Court proclaims that \"<i>Austin</i> is undermined by experience since its announcement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 912. This is a curious claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The majority has no empirical evidence with which to substantiate the claim; we just have its <i>ipse dixit</i> that the real world has not been kind to <i>Austin.</i> Nor does the majority bother to specify in what sense <i>Austin</i> has been \"undermined.\" Instead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs: \"Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing,\" <i>ante,</i> at 912; \"[s]peakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages,\" <i>ibid.;</i> \"[c]orporations ... do not have monolithic views,\" <i>ibid.</i> How any of these ruminations weakens the force of <i>stare decisis,</i> escapes my comprehension.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority also contends that the Government's hesitation to rely on <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale \"diminishe[s]\" \"the principle of adhering to that precedent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 912; see also <i>ante,</i> at 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (Government's litigating position is \"most importan[t]\" factor undermining <i>Austin</i>). Why it diminishes the value of <i>stare decisis</i> is left unexplained. We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can often be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may have strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing only a subset of them. Members of the public, moreover, often rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our precise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been regulating corporate electioneering since <i>Austin.</i> The task of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*940</span> Although the majority opinion spends several pages making these surprising arguments, it says almost nothing about the standard considerations we have used to determine <i>stare decisis</i> value, such as the antiquity of the precedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reliance interests at stake. It is also conspicuously silent about <i>McConnell,</i> even though the <i>McConnell</i> Court's decision to uphold BCRA § 203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of <i>Austin</i> but also on the statute's historical pedigree, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 540 U.S., at 115-132, 223-224, 124 S.Ct. 619, and the need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns, see <i>id.,</i> at 126-129, 205-208, and n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>We have recognized that \"<i>[s]tare decisis</i> has special force when legislators or citizens `have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.'\" <i>Hubbard v. United States,</i> 514 U.S. 695, 714, 115 S.Ct. 1754, 131 L.Ed.2d 779 (1995) (quoting <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991)). <i>Stare decisis</i> protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion. Today's decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise. State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in <i>Austin,</i> for more than a century.<sup>[20]</sup> The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on <i>Austin</i> throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA. The total record it compiled was <i>100,000 pages</i> long.<sup>[21]</sup> Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of § 203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.</p>\r\n<p>By removing one of its central components, today's ruling makes a hash out of BCRA's \"delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 172, 124 S.Ct. 619. Consider just one example of the distortions that will follow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or spending \"soft money,\" funds that are not subject to the statute's disclosure requirements or its source and amount limitations. 2 U.S.C. § 441i; <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 122-126, 124 S.Ct. 619. Going forward, corporations and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific candidates, whereas national parties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of any kind. The Court's ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of corporations and unionsand the narrow interests they representvis-à-vis the role of political partiesand the broad coalitions they representin determining who will hold public office.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other <i>stare decisis</i> factors also cut against the Court. Considerations of antiquity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*941</span> are significant for similar reasons. <i>McConnell</i> is only six years old, but <i>Austin</i> has been on the books for two decades, and many of the statutes called into question by today's opinion have been on the books for a half-century or more. The Court points to no intervening change in circumstances that warrants revisiting <i>Austin.</i> Certainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided <i>WRTL</i> two Terms ago. And the Court gives no reason to think that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are unworkable.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, no one has argued to us that <i>Austin</i>'s rule has proved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corporation, union, or State has asked us to overrule it. Quite to the contrary, leading groups representing the business community,<sup>[23]</sup> organized labor,<sup>[24]</sup> and the nonprofit sector,<sup>[25]</sup> together with more than half of the States,<sup>[26]</sup> urge that we preserve <i>Austin.</i> As for <i>McConnell,</i> the portions of BCRA it upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Government have worked to make § 203 as user-friendly as possible. For instance, Congress established a special mechanism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see note following 2 U.S.C. § 437h; the FEC has established a standardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors, for corporations to claim that a particular electioneering communication is permissible under <i>WRTL,</i> see 11 CFR § 114.15 (2009);<sup>[27]</sup> and, as noted above, THE CHIEF JUSTICE crafted his controlling opinion in <i>WRTL</i> with the express goal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U.S., at 469-470, 473-474, 127 S.Ct. 2652. The case for <i>stare decisis</i> may be bolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings \"have reduced the impact\" of a precedent \"while reaffirming the decision's core ruling.\" <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).<sup>[28]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the end, the Court's rejection of <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> comes down to nothing more than its disagreement with their results. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*942</span> Virtually every one of its arguments was made and rejected in those cases, and the majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents. The only relevant thing that has changed since <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> is the composition of this Court. Today's ruling thus strikes at the vitals of <i>stare decisis,</i> \"the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion\" that \"permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\" <i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> 474 U.S. 254, 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>III</h2>\r\n<p>The novelty of the Court's procedural dereliction and its approach to <i>stare decisis</i> is matched by the novelty of its ruling on the merits. The ruling rests on several premises. First, the Court claims that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> have \"banned\" corporate speech. Second, it claims that the First Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on speaker identity, including the speaker's identity as a corporation. Third, it claims that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our campaign finance jurisprudence. Each of these claims is wrong.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>The So-Called \"Ban\"</i></h2>\r\n<p>Pervading the Court's analysis is the ominous image of a \"categorical ba[n]\" on corporate speech. <i>Ante,</i> at 910. Indeed, the majority invokes the specter of a \"ban\" on nearly every page of its opinion. <i>Ante,</i> at 886-887, 889, 891-892, 894, 896-898, 900-907, 909-912, 915, 916. This characterization is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected.</p>\r\n<p>In fact it already has been. Our cases have repeatedly pointed out that, \"[c]ontrary to the [majority's] critical assumptions,\" the statutes upheld in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> do \"not impose an <i>absolute</i> ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391; see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 203-204, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 162-163, 123 S.Ct. 2200. For starters, both statutes provide exemptions for PACs, separate segregated funds established by a corporation for political purposes. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 169.255 (West 2005). \"The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds,\" we observed in <i>McConnell,</i> \"has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been this Court's unanimous view.\" 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Under BCRA, any corporation's \"stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families\" can pool their resources to finance electioneering communications. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). A significant and growing number of corporations avail themselves of this option;<sup>[29]</sup> during the most recent election cycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion dollars.<sup>[30]</sup> Administering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*943</span> a PAC entails some administrative burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds, see <i>ante,</i> at 914, and no one has suggested that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit corporation. To the extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is, just the majority's own unsupported factfinding, see <i>ante,</i> at 897-898. Like all other natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form. The owners of a \"mom &amp; pop\" store can simply place ads in their own names, rather than the store's. If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form, they may utilize an <i>MCFL</i> organization that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit for business or union interests. See <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 263-264, 107 S.Ct. 616.</p>\r\n<p>The laws upheld in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> leave open many additional avenues for corporations' political speech. Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluating in this case, BCRA § 203. It has no application to genuine issue advertisinga category of corporate speech Congress found to be far more substantial than election-related advertising, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619or to Internet, telephone, and print advocacy.<sup>[31]</sup> Like numerous statutes, it exempts media companies' news stories, commentaries, and editorials from its electioneering restrictions, in recognition of the unique role played by the institutional press in sustaining public debate.<sup>[32]</sup> See 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(B)(i); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 208-209, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 666-668, 110 S.Ct. 1391. It also allows corporations to spend unlimited sums on political communications with their executives and shareholders, § 441b(b)(2)(A); 11 CFR § 114.3(a)(1), to fund additional PAC activity through trade associations, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(D), to distribute voting guides and voting records, 11 CFR §§ 114.4(c)(4)-(5), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*944</span> to underwrite voter registration and voter turnout activities, § 114.3(c)(4); § 114.4(c)(2), to host fundraising events for candidates within certain limits, § 114.4(c); § 114.2(f)(2), and to publicly endorse candidates through a press release and press conference, § 114.4(c)(6).</p>\r\n<p>At the time Citizens United brought this lawsuit, the only types of speech that could be regulated under § 203 were: (1) broadcast, cable, or satellite communications;<sup>[33]</sup> (2) capable of reaching at least 50,000 persons in the relevant electorate;<sup>[34]</sup> (3) made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general federal election;<sup>[35]</sup> (4) by a labor union or a non-<i>MCFL,</i> nonmedia corporation;<sup>[36]</sup> (5) paid for with general treasury funds;<sup>[37]</sup> and (6) \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\"<sup>[38]</sup> The category of communications meeting all of these criteria is not trivial, but the notion that corporate political speech has been \"suppress[ed] ... altogether,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, that corporations have been \"exclu[ded]... from the general public dialogue,\" <i>ante,</i> at 899, or that a work of fiction such as <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> might be covered, <i>ante,</i> at 916-917, is nonsense.<sup>[39]</sup> Even the plaintiffs in <i>McConnell,</i> who had every incentive to depict BCRA as negatively as possible, declined to argue that § 203's prohibition on certain uses of general treasury funds amounts to a complete ban. See 540 U.S., at 204, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>In many ways, then, § 203 functions as a source restriction or a time, place, and manner restriction. It applies in a viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office, made during discrete time periods through discrete channels. In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast <i>Hillary</i> right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC, which by its own account is \"one of the most active conservative PACs in America,\" Citizens United Political Victory Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/.<sup>[40]</sup></p>\r\n<p>So let us be clear: Neither <i>Austin</i> nor <i>McConnell</i> held or implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a \"censor\"; and in the years since these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*945</span> cases were decided, corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue. Laws such as § 203 target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process, that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens, and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden political speech, and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scrutiny. But the majority's incessant talk of a \"ban\" aims at a straw man.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Identity-Based Distinctions</i></h2>\r\n<p>The second pillar of the Court's opinion is its assertion that \"the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker's ... identity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 902; accord, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 898, 900, 902-904, 912-913. The case on which it relies for this proposition is <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). As I shall explain, <i>infra,</i> at 958-960, the holding in that case was far narrower than the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfettered discourse, the Court's denunciation of identity-based distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures reality.</p>\r\n<p>\"Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation\" of the First Amendment. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the press, that text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind. Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that speech can be regulated differentially on account of the speaker's identity, when identity is understood in categorical or institutional terms. The Government routinely places special restrictions on the speech rights of students,<sup>[41]</sup> prisoners,<sup>[42]</sup> members of the Armed Forces,<sup>[43]</sup> foreigners,<sup>[44]</sup> and its own employees.<sup>[45]</sup> When such restrictions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*946</span> they do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.<sup>[46]</sup> In contrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses, our cases recognize that the Government's interests may be more or less compelling with respect to different classes of speakers,<sup>[47]</sup> cf. <i>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue,</i> 460 U.S. 575, 585, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983) (\"[D]ifferential treatment\" is constitutionally suspect \"<i>unless</i> justified by some special characteristic\" of the regulated class of speakers (emphasis added)), and that the constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers, in certain contexts, \"`are not automatically coextensive with the rights'\" that are normally accorded to members of our society, <i>Morse v. Frederick,</i> 551 U.S. 393, 396-397, 404, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (quoting <i>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser,</i> 478 U.S. 675, 682, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986)).</p>\r\n<p>The free speech guarantee thus does not render every other public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a speaker's autonomy; society could scarcely function if it did. It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine has \"frowned on\" certain identity-based distinctions, <i>Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp.,</i> 528 U.S. 32, 47, n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 483, 145 L.Ed.2d 451 (1999) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), particularly those that may reflect invidious discrimination or preferential treatment of a politically powerful group. But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or content. Not even close.</p>\r\n<p>The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely guards political speech. But in this context, too, the authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled. We have, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to exclude independent candidates from televised debates. <i>Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes,</i> 523 U.S. 666, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998).<sup>[48]</sup> We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distribution or display of campaign materials near a polling place. <i>Burson v. Freeman,</i> 504 U.S. 191, 112 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*947</span> 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).<sup>[49]</sup> Although we have not reviewed them directly, we have never cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nationals. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441e(a)(1). And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees, but not others, from contributing to or participating in political activities. See n. 45, <i>supra.</i> These statutes burden the political expression of one class of speakers, namely, civil servants. Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and Congress' reasoned judgment that certain regulations which leave \"untouched full participation ... in political decisions at the ballot box,\" <i>Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers,</i> 413 U.S. 548, 556, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), help ensure that public officials are \"sufficiently free from improper influences,\" <i>id.,</i> at 564, 93 S.Ct. 2880, and that \"confidence in the system of representative Government is not ... eroded to a disastrous extent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 565, 93 S.Ct. 2880.</p>\r\n<p>The same logic applies to this case with additional force because it is the identity of corporations, rather than individuals, that the Legislature has taken into account. As we have unanimously observed, legislatures are entitled to decide \"that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation\" in an electoral context. <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552.<sup>[50]</sup> Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized, but within the area of campaign finance, corporate spending is also \"furthest from the core of political expression, since corporations' First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information,\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 161, n. 8, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (citation omitted). Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because the \"speakers\" are not natural persons, much less members of our political community, and the governmental interests are of the highest order. Furthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished from noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimination or political favoritism.</p>\r\n<p>If taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has <i>no</i> relevance to the Government's ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by \"Tokyo Rose\" during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*948</span> controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \"`enhance the relative voice'\" of some (<i>i.e.,</i> humans) over others (<i>i.e.,</i> nonhumans). <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612).<sup>[51]</sup> Under the majority's view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In short, the Court dramatically overstates its critique of identity-based distinctions, without ever explaining why corporate identity demands the same treatment as individual identity. Only the most wooden approach to the First Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it seeks to draw.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Our First Amendment Tradition</i></h2>\r\n<p>A third fulcrum of the Court's opinion is the idea that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are radical outliers, \"aberration[s],\" in our First Amendment tradition. <i>Ante,</i> at 907; see also <i>ante,</i> at 910, 916-917 (professing fidelity to \"our law and our tradition\"). The Court has it exactly backwards. It is today's holding that is the radical departure from what had been settled First Amendment law. To see why, it is useful to take a long view.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>1. <i>Original Understandings</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Let us start from the beginning. The Court invokes \"ancient First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886 (internal quotation marks omitted), and original understandings, <i>ante,</i> at 906-907, to defend today's ruling, yet it makes only a perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the principles or understandings of those who drafted and ratified the Amendment. Perhaps this is because there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed it would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form. To the extent that the Framers' views are discernible and relevant to the disposition of this case, they would appear to cut strongly against the majority's position.</p>\r\n<p>This is not only because the Framers and their contemporaries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now think of it, see Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*949</span> L.J. 1, 22 (1971), but also because they held very different views about the nature of the First Amendment right and the role of corporations in society. Those few corporations that existed at the founding were authorized by grant of a special legislative charter.<sup>[53]</sup> Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature, and the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter that specified the corporation's powers and purposes and \"authoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate organization,\" including \"the internal structure of the corporation.\" J. Hurst, The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States 1780-1970, pp. 15-16 (1970) (reprint 2004). Corporations were created, supervised, and conceptualized as quasi-public entities, \"designed to serve a social function for the state.\" Handlin &amp; Handlin, Origin of the American Business Corporation, 5 J. Econ. Hist. 1, 22 (1945). It was \"assumed that [they] were legally privileged organizations that had to be closely scrutinized by the legislature because their purposes had to be made consistent with public welfare.\" R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784-1855, p. 5 (1982).</p>\r\n<p>The individualized charter mode of incorporation reflected the \"cloud of disfavor under which corporations labored\" in the early years of this Nation. 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 2, p. 8 (rev. ed.2006); see also <i>Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee,</i> 288 U.S. 517, 548-549, 53 S.Ct. 481, 77 L.Ed. 929 (1933) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (discussing fears of the \"evils\" of business corporations); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed.1985) (\"The word `soulless' constantly recurs in debates over corporations.... Corporations, it was feared, could concentrate the worst urges of whole groups of men\"). Thomas Jefferson famously fretted that corporations would subvert the Republic.<sup>[54]</sup> General incorporation statutes, and widespread acceptance of business corporations as socially useful actors, did not emerge until the 1800's. See Hansmann &amp; Kraakman, The End of History for Corporate Law, 89 Geo. L.J. 439, 440 (2001) (hereinafter Hansmann &amp; Kraakman) (\"[A]ll general business corporation statutes appear to date from well after 1800\").</p>\r\n<p>The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively <span class=\"star-pagination\">*950</span> regulated in the service of the public welfare. Unlike our colleagues, they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.<sup>[55]</sup> While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights, business corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends. Even \"the notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,\" given that \"at the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign.\" Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate Speech, 18 Hastings Const. L.Q. 541, 578 (1991); cf. <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> 4 Wheat. 518, 636, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Marshall, C.J.) (\"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it\"); Eule, Promoting Speaker Diversity: Austin and Metro Broadcasting, 1990 S.Ct. Rev. 105, 129 (\"The framers of the First Amendment could scarcely have anticipated its application to the corporation form. That, of course, ought not to be dispositive. What is compelling, however, is an understanding of who was supposed to be the beneficiary of the free speech guarantythe individual\"). In light of these background practices and understandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers believed \"the freedom of speech\" would extend equally to all corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to guard against corporate capture of elections.</p>\r\n<p>The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse intellectual sources, communicated through newspapers, and aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed in England. <i>Ante,</i> at 906. From these (accurate) observations, the Court concludes that \"[t]he First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society's most salient media.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This conclusion is far from certain, given that many historians believe the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication and did not understand the First Amendment to \"prevent the subsequent punishment of such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*951</span> <i>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,</i> 283 U.S. 697, 714, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). Yet, even if the majority's conclusion were correct, it would tell us only that the First Amendment was understood to protect political speech <i>in</i> certain media. It would tell us little about whether the Amendment was understood to protect general treasury electioneering expenditures <i>by</i> corporations, <i>and to what extent.</i></p>\r\n<p>As a matter of original expectations, then, it seems absurd to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor of electoral advocacy. As a matter of original meaning, it likewise seems baselessunless one evaluates the First Amendment's \"principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, or its \"purpose,\" <i>ante,</i> at 919-920 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), at such a high level of generality that the historical understandings of the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judicial task. This case sheds a revelatory light on the assumption of some that an impartial judge's application of an originalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the decisional process, than his or her views about sound policy.</p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA criticizes the foregoing discussion for failing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that corporations were understood to be excluded from the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. <i>Ante,</i> at 925-926, 929. Of course, Justice SCALIA adduces no statements to suggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that the contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right that the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause thought they were enshrining. Although Justice SCALIA makes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual's right to speak entails a right to speak with others for a common cause, cf. <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539, he does not explain why those two rights must be precisely identical, or why that principle applies to electioneering by corporations that serve no \"common cause.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 928. Nothing in his account dislodges my basic point that members of the founding generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they \"despised\" corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 925), and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms. If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech, that may well be because the contrary propositionif not also the very notion of \"corporate speech\" was inconceivable.<sup>[56]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA also emphasizes the unqualified nature of the First Amendment text. <i>Ante,</i> at 925, 928-929. Yet he would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally? <i>Ante,</i> at 927.<sup>[57]</sup> Like virtually all modern lawyers, Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*952</span> SCALIA presumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Executive, even though its language refers to Congress alone. In any event, the text only leads us back to the questions who or what is guaranteed \"the freedom of speech,\" and, just as critically, what that freedom consists of and under what circumstances it may be limited. Justice SCALIA appears to believe that because corporations are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as night the day) that their electioneering must be equally protected by the First Amendment and equally immunized from expenditure limits. See <i>ante,</i> at 928-929. That conclusion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and Justice SCALIA fails to explain why the original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA § 203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amendment.<sup>[58]</sup> I have given several reasons why I believe the Constitution would have been understood then, and ought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restrictions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many more reasons in the pages to come. The Court enlists the Framers in its defense without seriously grappling with their understandings of corporations or the free speech right, or with the republican principles that underlay those understandings.</p>\r\n<p>In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has never attended very closely to the views of the Framers, see <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 280, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), whose political universe differed profoundly from that of today. We have long since held that corporations are covered by the First Amendment, and many legal scholars have long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation. But \"historical context is usually relevant,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted), and in light of the Court's effort to cast itself as guardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today's outcome. To the contrary, this history helps illuminate just how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2. <i>Legislative and Judicial Interpretation</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today's ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition. At the federal level, the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corporate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on the legislation observed that \"[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*953</span> argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials.\" S.Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906). President Roosevelt, in his 1905 annual message to Congress, declared:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"`All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.'\" <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S. 567, 572, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957) (quoting 40 Cong. Rec. 96).</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the Tillman Act several times, see <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 508-510, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 115, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 570-575, 77 S.Ct. 529, and I will refrain from doing so again. It is enough to say that the Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first, the enormous power corporations had come to wield in federal elections, with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and a public perception of corruption; and second, a respect for the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the use of their money to support candidates they opposed. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>United States v. CIO,</i> 335 U.S. 106, 113, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948); Winkler, \"Other People's Money\": Corporations, Agency Costs, and Campaign Finance Law, 92 Geo. L.J. 871 (2004).</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, the limitations on corporate political spending have been modified in a number of ways, as Congress responded to changes in the American economy and political practices that threatened to displace the commonweal. Justice Souter recently traced these developments at length.<sup>[59]</sup><i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 507-519, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (dissenting opinion); see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 115-133, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 188-205. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case. In that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress extended the prohibition on corporate support of candidates to cover not only direct contributions, but independent expenditures as well. Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, § 304, 61 Stat. 159. The bar on contributions \"was being so narrowly construed\" that corporations were easily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting candidates through other means. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 511, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing S.Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39 (1947)).</p>\r\n<p>Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions, even though the Court declined to pass on its constitutionality. <i>Ante,</i> at 900-901. Two features of these cases are of far greater relevance. First, those Justices were writing separately; which is to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> say, their position failed to command a majority. Prior to today, this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents. Second, each case in this line expressed support for the principle that corporate and union political speech financed with PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organization's stockholders or members, receives greater protection than speech financed with general treasury funds.<sup>[60]</sup></p>\r\n<p>This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, which retained the restriction on using general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a). FECA codified the option for corporations and unions to create PACs to finance contributions and expenditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself. § 441b(b).</p>\r\n<p>By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on corporate contributions and expenditures had become such an accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation that when a large number of plaintiffs, including several nonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of the Act in <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, no one even bothered to argue that the bar as such was unconstitutional. <i>Buckley</i> famously (or infamously) distinguished direct contributions from independent expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 58-59, 96 S.Ct. 612, but its silence on corporations only reinforced the understanding that corporate expenditures could be treated differently from individual expenditures. \"Since our decision in <i>Buckley,</i> Congress' power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that Congress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting nonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*955</span> that Congress' \"careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cautious advance, step by step, to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations . . . warrants considerable deference,\" and \"reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process.\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209, 103 S.Ct. 552 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"The governmental interest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected representatives has long been recognized,\" the unanimous Court observed, \"and there is no reason why it may not . . . be accomplished by treating . . . corporations . . . differently from individuals.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 210-211, 103 S.Ct. 552.</p>\r\n<p>The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned by the Court's disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the expenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonprofit corporation. In <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539, we stated again \"that `the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 256, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552), and again we acknowledged that the Government has a legitimate interest in \"regulat[ing] the substantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form,\" 479 U.S., at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (internal quotation marks omitted). Those aggregations can distort the \"free trade in ideas\" crucial to candidate elections, <i>ibid.,</i> at the expense of members or shareholders who may disagree with the object of the expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 260, 107 S.Ct. 616 (internal quotation marks omitted). What the Court held by a 5-to-4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures, because Congress' interests in protecting shareholders and \"restrict[ing] `the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting <i>FEC v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> 470 U.S. 480, 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985) <i>(NCPAC)</i>), did not apply to corporations that were structurally insulated from those concerns.<sup>[61]</sup></p>\r\n<p>It is worth remembering for present purposes that the four <i>MCFL</i> dissenters, led by Chief Justice Rehnquist, thought the Court was carrying the First Amendment <i>too far.</i> They would have recognized congressional authority to bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that \"the threat from corporate political activity will vary depending on the particular characteristics of a given corporation,\" but believed these \"distinctions among corporations\" were \"distinctions in degree,\" not \"in kind,\" and thus \"more properly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.\" 479 U.S., at 268, 107 S.Ct. 616 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of corporate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> political speech could be no more stringent than of speech by an individual.</p>\r\n<p>Four years later, in <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652, we considered whether corporations falling outside the <i>MCFL</i> exception could be barred from using general treasury funds to make independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates. We held they could be. Once again recognizing the importance of \"the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas\" in candidate elections, <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616, we noted that corporations have \"special advantagessuch as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets,\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391that allow them to spend prodigious general treasury sums on campaign messages that have \"little or no correlation\" with the beliefs held by actual persons, <i>id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have on the political process, <i>ibid.,</i> we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations' PACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus \"reflect actual public support for the political ideals espoused by corporations,\" <i>ibid.</i> Notwithstanding our colleagues' insinuations that <i>Austin</i> deprived the public of general \"ideas,\" \"facts,\" and \"knowledge,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906-907, the decision addressed only candidate-focused expenditures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate spending on other matters.</p>\r\n<p>In the 20 years since <i>Austin,</i> we have reaffirmed its holding and rationale a number of times, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 153-156, 123 S.Ct. 2200, most importantly in <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491, where we upheld the provision challenged here, § 203 of BCRA.<sup>[62]</sup> Congress crafted § 203 in response to a problem created by <i>Buckley.</i> The <i>Buckley</i> Court had construed FECA's definition of prohibited \"expenditures\" narrowly to avoid any problems of constitutional vagueness, holding it applicable only to \"communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,\" 424 U.S., at 80, 96 S.Ct. 612, <i>i.e.,</i> statements containing so-called \"magic words\" like \"`vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,' `defeat,' [or] `reject,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 43-44, and n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612. After <i>Buckley,</i> corporations and unions figured out how to circumvent the limits on express advocacy by using sham \"issue ads\" that \"eschewed the use of magic words\" but nonetheless \"advocate[d] the election or defeat of clearly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*957</span> identified federal candidates.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 126, 124 S.Ct. 619. \"Corporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 127, 124 S.Ct. 619. Congress passed § 203 to address this circumvention, prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for electioneering communications that \"refe[r] to a clearly identified candidate,\" whether or not those communications use the magic words. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I).</p>\r\n<p>When we asked in <i>McConnell</i> \"whether a compelling governmental interest justifie[d]\" § 203, we found the question \"easily answered\": \"We have repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at `the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.'\" 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391). These precedents \"represent respect for the legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation.\" 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Moreover, recent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against `\"circumvention of [valid] contribution limits.\"'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 155, 123 S.Ct. 2200, in turn quoting <i>FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,</i> 533 U.S. 431, 456, and n. 18, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001) <i>(Colorado II);</i> alteration in original). BCRA, we found, is faithful to the compelling governmental interests in \"`preserving the integrity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, . . . sustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of the government,'\" and maintaining \"`the individual citizen's confidence in government.'\" 540 U.S., at 206-207, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407; some internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). What made the answer even easier than it might have been otherwise was the option to form PACs, which give corporations, at the least, \"a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in\" independent expenditures. 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3. <i>Buckley and Bellotti</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Against this extensive background of congressional regulation of corporate campaign spending, and our repeated affirmation of this regulation as constitutionally sound, the majority dismisses <i>Austin</i> as \"a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886 (internal quotation marks omitted). How does the majority attempt to justify this claim? Selected passages from two cases, <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, and <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, do all of the work. In the Court's view, <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti</i> decisively rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from natural persons in the 1970's; it just so happens that in every single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign finance legislation in the decades since, the majority failed to grasp this truth. The Federal Congress and dozens of state legislatures, we now know, have been similarly deluded.</p>\r\n<p>The majority emphasizes <i>Buckley</i>'s statement that \"`[t]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612); <i>ante,</i> at 921 (opinion of ROBERTS, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*958</span> C.J.). But this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it. For one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit numerous \"restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many\": for example, restrictions on ballot access and on legislators' floor time. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 402, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring). For another, the <i>Buckley</i> Court used this line in evaluating \"the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612. It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case before us. The majority suggests that <i>Austin</i> rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization, <i>ante,</i> at 904-905; <i>ante,</i> at 921-922 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), but we made it clear in <i>Austin</i> (as in several cases before and since) that a restriction on the way corporations spend their money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of some elements of our society in preference to others. Indeed, we <i>expressly</i> ruled that the compelling interest supporting Michigan's statute was not one of \"`equaliz[ing] the relative influence of speakers on elections,'\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>id.,</i> at 705, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)), but rather the need to confront the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy financed by general treasury dollars, <i>id.,</i> at 659-660, 110 S.Ct. 1391.</p>\r\n<p>For that matter, it should go without saying that when we made this statement in <i>Buckley,</i> we could not have been casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expenditures in candidate elections, which had not been challenged as \"foreign to the First Amendment,\" <i>ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612), or for any other reason. <i>Buckley</i>'s independent expenditure analysis was focused on a very different statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V). It is implausible to think, as the majority suggests, <i>ante,</i> at 901-902, that <i>Buckley</i> covertly invalidated FECA's separate corporate and union campaign expenditure restriction, § 610 (now codified at 2 U.S.C. § 441b), even though that restriction had been on the books for decades before <i>Buckley</i> and would remain on the books, undisturbed, for decades after.</p>\r\n<p>The case on which the majority places even greater weight than <i>Buckley,</i> however, is <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, claiming it \"could not have been clearer\" that <i>Bellotti</i>'s holding forbade distinctions between corporate and individual expenditures like the one at issue here, <i>ante,</i> at 902. The Court's reliance is odd. The only thing about <i>Bellotti</i> that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority's position. <i>Bellotti</i> ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding, that \"our consideration of a corporation's right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see also <i>id.,</i> at 787-788, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving public confidence in Government and protecting dissenting shareholders may be \"weighty . . . in the context of partisan candidate elections\"). <i>Bellotti,</i> in other words, did not touch the question presented in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it.</p>\r\n<p>The majority attempts to explain away the distinction <i>Bellotti</i> drewbetween general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*959</span> as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with <i>Buckley. Ante,</i> at 903, 909-910. Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections, the \"importance\" of which \"has never been doubted,\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda. A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the corporation's retaliation. Cf. <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (STEVENS, J., concurring); <i>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 299, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). The majority likewise overlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases have repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinction. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 495-496, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,</i> 468 U.S. 364, 371, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 552. The Court's critique of <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote 26 puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate <i>Bellotti</i> to canonical status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with <i>Buckley. Bellotti,</i> apparently, is both the font of all wisdom and internally incoherent.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>Bellotti</i> Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a state statute that barred business corporations' expenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifically, the statute barred a business corporation \"from making contributions or expenditures `for the purpose of. . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation,'\" 435 U.S., at 768, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55, § 8 (West Supp.1977); alteration in original), and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not \"`be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation,'\" 435 U.S., at 768, 98 S.Ct. 1407. As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. See <i>id.,</i> at 769-770, and n. 3, 98 S.Ct. 1407. We said that \"where, as here, the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (footnote omitted).</p>\r\n<p><i>Bellotti</i> thus involved a <i>viewpoint-discriminatory</i> statute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that \"a very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth's referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 827, n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 1407. To make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs. <i>Id.,</i> at 768, n. 2, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (opinion of the Court). This really was a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*960</span> complete ban on a specific, preidentified subject. See <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 259, n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 616 (stating that 2 U.S.C. § 441b's expenditure restriction \"is <i>of course distinguishable</i> from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in the state referendum context in . . . <i>Bellotti</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\r\n<p>The majority grasps a quotational straw from <i>Bellotti,</i> that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corporation. <i>Ante,</i> at 902-903. Of course not, but no one suggests the contrary and neither <i>Austin</i> nor <i>McConnell</i> held otherwise. They held that even though the expenditures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a compelling state interest. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 658, 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. We acknowledged in <i>Bellotti</i> that numerous \"interests of the highest importance\" can justify campaign finance regulation. 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407. But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law. <i>Id.,</i> at 789, 98 S.Ct. 1407. We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been \"record or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> then, sit perfectly well with <i>Bellotti.</i> Indeed, all six Members of the <i>Austin</i> majority had been on the Court at the time of <i>Bellotti,</i> and none so much as hinted in <i>Austin</i> that they saw any tension between the decisions. The difference between the cases is not that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas <i>Bellotti</i> accepted it. The difference is that the statute at issue in <i>Bellotti</i> smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>* * *</h2>\r\n<p>In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to \"`[p]reserv[e] the integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . . sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,'\" protect the expressive interests of shareholders, and \"`[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen's confidence in government.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 206-207, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407; first alteration in original). These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 570-575, 77 S.Ct. 529, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, see <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 511, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting), FECA in 1971, see <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552, and BCRA in 2002, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 126-132, 124 S.Ct. 619. Continuously for over 100 years, this line of \"[c]ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 522, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). Time and again, we have recognized these realities in approving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*961</span> measures that Congress and the States have taken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary. The only thing new about <i>Austin</i> was the dissent, with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>IV</h2>\r\n<p>Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in which to revisit <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> and why these decisions sit perfectly well with \"First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, I come at last to the interests that are at stake. The majority recognizes that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> may be defended on anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales. <i>Ante,</i> at 903-911. It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales, which overlap and complement each other, and in applying them to the case at hand.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>The Anticorruption Interest</i></h2>\r\n<p>Undergirding the majority's approach to the merits is the claim that the only \"sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption\" is one that is \"limited to <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 909-910. This is the same \"crabbed view of corruption\" that was espoused by Justice KENNEDY in <i>McConnell</i> and squarely rejected by the Court in that case. 540 U.S., at 152, 124 S.Ct. 619. While it is true that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the approach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my judgment. It disregards our constitutional history and the fundamental demands of a democratic society.</p>\r\n<p>On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress' legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an \"`undue influence on an officeholder's judgment'\" and from creating \"`the appearance of such influence,'\" beyond the sphere of <i>quid pro quo</i> relationships. <i>Id.,</i> at 150, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 143-144, 152-154, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Colorado II,</i> 533 U.S., at 441, 121 S.Ct. 2351; <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 389, 120 S.Ct. 897. Corruption can take many forms. Bribery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one's behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority's apparent belief that <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics. It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each other's backsand which amply supported Congress' determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis, Judge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the corrupting consequences of corporate and union independent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA's passage. See <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-560, 622-625; see also <i>id.,</i> at 804-805, 813, n. 143 (Leon, J.) (indicating agreement). As summarized in her own words:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members' elections. The record also indicates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*962</span> that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election-related advertisements. Indeed, Members of Congress are particularly grateful when negative issue advertisements are run by these organizations, leaving the candidates free to run positive advertisements and be seen as `above the fray.' Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate's behalf, when they are being run, and where they are being run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Findings also demonstrate that Members of Congress seek to have corporations and unions run these advertisements on their behalf. The Findings show that Members suggest that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups with the understanding that the money contributed to these groups will assist the Member in a campaign. After the election, these organizations often seek credit for their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 623-624 (citations and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\r\n<p>Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge Kollar-Kotelly seemed to have a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis, but other arrangements were more subtle. Her analysis shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of the <i>quid pro quo</i> category, as well as the adverse consequences that <i>all</i> such arrangements may have. There are threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society than the odd bribe. Yet the majority's understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but the most discrete abuses.</p>\r\n<p>Our \"undue influence\" cases have allowed the American people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, \"that officeholders will decide issues . . . on the merits or the desires of their constituencies,\" and not \"according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions\"or expenditures \"valued by the officeholder.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619.<sup>[63]</sup> When private interests are seen to exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account of the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns, the result can depart so thoroughly \"from what is pure or correct\" in the conduct of Government, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 512 (1966) (defining \"corruption\"), that it amounts to a \"subversion . . . of the electoral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*963</span> process,\" <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 575, 77 S.Ct. 529. At stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Government but also the public's faith therein, not only \"the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents [but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves,\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 507, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). \"Take away Congress' authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and `the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897).<sup>[64]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The cluster of interrelated interests threatened by such undue influence and its appearance has been well captured under the rubric of \"democratic integrity.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 522, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). This value has underlined a century of state and federal efforts to regulate the role of corporations in the electoral process.<sup>[65]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Unlike the majority's myopic focus on <i>quid pro quo</i> scenarios and the free-floating \"First Amendment principles\" on which it rests so much weight, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, this broader understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation's history. \"During debates on the earliest [campaign finance] reform acts, the terms `corruption' and `undue influence' were used nearly interchangeably.\" Pasquale, Reclaiming Egalitarianism in the Political Theory of Campaign Finance Reform, 2008 U. Ill. L.Rev. 599, 601. Long before <i>Buckley,</i> we appreciated that \"[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard . . . an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\" <i>Burroughs v. United States,</i> 290 U.S. 534, 545, 54 S.Ct. 287, 78 L.Ed. 484 (1934). And whereas we have no evidence to support the notion that the Framers would have wanted corporations to have the same rights as natural persons in the electoral context, we have ample evidence to suggest that they would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance. It is fair to say that \"[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*964</span> Teachout 348, which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests, see <i>id.,</i> at 373-374; see also <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 280, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). They discussed corruption \"more often in the Constitutional Convention than factions, violence, or instability.\" Teachout 352. When they brought our constitutional order into being, the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self-government that this Court has lost sight of.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Quid Pro Quo <i>Corruption</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>There is no need to take my side in the debate over the scope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court's merits holding is wrong. Even under the majority's \"crabbed view of corruption,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 152, 124 S.Ct. 619, the Government should not lose this case.</p>\r\n<p>\"The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption through the creation of political debts] has never been doubted.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption interest most narrowly, we have never suggested that such <i>quid pro quo</i> debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct crimes. Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of, some outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 143, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"We have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In <i>Buckley,</i> we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA's contribution limits, noting that such laws `deal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action'\" (quoting 424 U.S., at 28, 96 S.Ct. 612; alteration in original)). It has likewise never been doubted that \"[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 27, 96 S.Ct. 612. Congress may \"legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.</p>\r\n<p>In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied to BCRA § 203, however, they conclude \"[t]he anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 908.</p>\r\n<p>Although the Court suggests that <i>Buckley</i> compels its conclusion, <i>ante,</i> at 908-910, <i>Buckley</i> cannot sustain this reading. It is true that, in evaluating FECA's ceiling on independent expenditures by all persons, the <i>Buckley</i> Court found the governmental interest in preventing corruption \"inadequate.\" 424 U.S., at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612. But <i>Buckley</i> did not evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it rule out the possibility that a future Court might find otherwise. The opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering only express advocacy (<i>i.e.,</i> magic words) would likely be ineffectual, <i>ibid.,</i> a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that \"the independent advocacy restricted by [FECA § 608(e)(1)] <i>does not presently appear</i> to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions,\" <i>id.,</i> at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612 (emphasis added). <i>Buckley</i> expressly contemplated that an anticorruption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*965</span> rationale might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at a later date, \"because it may be that, in some circumstances, `large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements as do large contributions.'\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 478, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612). Certainly <i>Buckley</i> did not foreclose this possibility with respect to electioneering communications made with corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had no occasion to consider.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>Austin</i> Court did not rest its holding on <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, as it found the broader corruption implicated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a sufficient basis for Michigan's restriction on corporate electioneering. 494 U.S., at 658-660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Concurring in that opinion, I took the position that \"the danger of either the fact, or the appearance, of <i>quid pro quo</i> relationships [also] provides an adequate justification for state regulation\" of these independent expenditures. <i>Id.,</i> at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391. I did not see this position as inconsistent with <i>Buckley</i>'s analysis of individual expenditures. Corporations, as a class, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny; they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy access and votes. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1 trillion during the last election cycle). Business corporations must engage the political process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The unparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups) spend unrestricted sums on elections.</p>\r\n<p>It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now say that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corporations grew more and more adept at crafting \"issue ads\" to help or harm a particular candidate, these nominally independent expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very direct sense. The sponsors of these ads were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over; \"candidates and officials knew who their friends were,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 129, 124 S.Ct. 619. Many corporate independent expenditures, it seemed, had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. In an age in which money and television ads are the coin of the campaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influence over, public officials.</p>\r\n<p>The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA record does not contain \"direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted). It would have been quite remarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such behavior by its own Members. Proving that a specific vote was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been next to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motivations, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote. Yet, even if \"[i]ngratiation and access . . . are not corruption\" themselves, <i>ibid.,</i> they are necessary prerequisites to it; they can create both the opportunity for, and the appearance of, <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*966</span> realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of <i>quid pro quo</i> deals: threats, both explicit and implicit. Starting today, corporations with large war chests to deploy on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their interests. The majority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record provides \"only scant evidence that independent expenditures. . . ingratiate,\" and that, \"in any event,\" none of it matters. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly documented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained its significance under the majority's own touchstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption rationale, <i>Buckley.</i> See <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-560, 622-625. Witnesses explained how political parties and candidates used corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA's \"hard-money\" limitations. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 478-479. One former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that \"`[c]andidates whose campaigns benefit from [phony \"issue ads\"] greatly appreciate the help of these groups. In fact, Members will also be favorably disposed to those who finance these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending legislation.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers). One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontroverted testimony, that \"`unregulated expenditureswhether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad campaignscan sometimes generate <i>far more</i> influence than direct campaign contributions.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting declaration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum, Judge Kollar-Kotelly found, \"[t]he record powerfully demonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with the general treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears those entities to elected officials in a way that could be perceived by the public as corrupting.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 622-623. She concluded that the Government's interest in preventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept was defined in <i>Buckley,</i> was itself sufficient to uphold BCRA § 203. 251 F.Supp.2d, at 622-625. Judge Leon agreed. See <i>id.,</i> at 804-805 (dissenting only with respect to the Wellstone Amendment's coverage of <i>MCFL</i> corporations).</p>\r\n<p>When the <i>McConnell</i> Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court regarding § 203, we did not rest our holding on a narrow notion of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. Instead we relied on the governmental interest in combating the unique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as recognized in <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales, 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (citing <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391), as well as the interest in preventing circumvention of contribution limits, 540 U.S., at 128-129, 205, 206, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619. Had we felt constrained by the view of today's Court that <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption and its appearance are the only interests that count in this field, <i>ante,</i> at 903-911, we of course would have looked closely at that issue. And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly reflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found one or both of those interests satisfied and § 203 appropriately tailored to them.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's rejection of the <i>Buckley</i> anticorruption rationale on the ground that independent corporate expenditures \"do not give rise to [<i>quid pro quo</i>] corruption or the appearance of corruption,\" <i>ante,</i> at 909, is thus unfair as well as unreasonable. Congress and outside experts have generated significant evidence corroborating this rationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the relevant materials before us is that the Government had no reason <span class=\"star-pagination\">*967</span> to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge the plaintiff had abandoned. The Court cannot both <i>sua sponte</i> choose to relitigate <i>McConnell</i> on appeal and then complain that the Government has failed to substantiate its case. If our colleagues were really serious about the interest in preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, they would remand to the District Court with instructions to commence evidentiary proceedings.<sup>[66]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The insight that even technically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions is bolstered by our decision last year in <i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009). In that case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a corporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Virginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular candidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that court. \"In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin's campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to `And For The Sake Of The Kids,'\" a § 527 corporation that ran ads targeting Benjamin's opponent. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257. \"This was not all. Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures. . . `\"to support . . . Brent Benjamin.\"'\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257 (second alteration in original). Applying its common sense, this Court accepted petitioners' argument that Blankenship's \"pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias\" when Benjamin later declined to recuse himself from the appeal by Blankenship's corporation. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2262. \"Though n[o] . . . bribe or criminal influence\" was involved, we recognized that \"Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias,\" we further noted, \"simply underscore the need for objective rules,\" <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2263rules which will perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its actual existence.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>Caperton,</i> then, we accepted the premise that, at least in some circumstances, independent expenditures on candidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. Indeed, this premise struck the Court as so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship's spending on behalf of Benjaminspending that consisted of 99.97% independent expenditures ($3 million) and 0.03% direct contributions ($1,000)as a \"contribution.\" See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257 (\"The basis for the [recusal] motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from\" Blankenship); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2258 (referencing \"Blankenship's $3 million in contributions\"); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2264 (\"Blankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace <span class=\"star-pagination\">*968</span> him with Benjamin\"); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2264 (\"Blankenship's campaign contributions . . . had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome\"). The reason the Court so thoroughly conflated expenditures and contributions, one assumes, is that it realized that some expenditures may be functionally equivalent to contributions in the way they influence the outcome of a race, the way they are interpreted by the candidates and the public, and the way they taint the decisions that the officeholder thereafter takes.</p>\r\n<p><i>Caperton</i> is illuminating in several additional respects. It underscores the old insight that, on account of the extreme difficulty of proving corruption, \"prophylactic measures, reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in purpose or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard against corruption.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 30, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 392, n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 897. It underscores that \"certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement\" may likewise be needed to \"hedge against circumvention of valid contribution limits.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also <i>Colorado II,</i> 533 U.S., at 456, 121 S.Ct. 2351 (\"[A]ll Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption\"). It underscores that for-profit corporations associated with electioneering communications will often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with \"misleading names,\" such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, \"to conceal their identity\" as the sponsor of those communications, thereby frustrating the utility of disclosure laws. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 128, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also <i>id.,</i> at 196-197, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>And it underscores that the consequences of today's holding will not be limited to the legislative or executive context. The majority of the States select their judges through popular elections. At a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, see, <i>e.g.,</i> O'Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov. 15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union general treasury spending in these races. Perhaps \"<i>Caperton</i> motions\" will catch some of the worst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Deference and Incumbent Self-Protection</i></h2>\r\n<p>Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch of Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorruption rationale without serious analysis.<sup>[67]</sup> Today's opinion provides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Congress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies have offered one: the incentives of the legislators who passed BCRA. Section 203, our colleagues have suggested, may be little more than \"an incumbency protection plan,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 306, 124 S.Ct. 619 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also <i>id.,</i> at 249-250, 260-263, 124 S.Ct. 619 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), a disreputable attempt at legislative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*969</span> self-dealing rather than an earnest effort to facilitate First Amendment values and safeguard the legitimacy of our political system. This possibility, the Court apparently believes, licenses it to run roughshod over Congress' handiwork.</p>\r\n<p>In my view, we should instead start by acknowledging that \"Congress surely has both wisdom and experience in these matters that is far superior to ours.\" <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. FEC,</i> 518 U.S. 604, 650, 116 S.Ct. 2309, 135 L.Ed.2d 795 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Many of our campaign finance precedents explicitly and forcefully affirm the propriety of such presumptive deference. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 158, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 155-156, 123 S.Ct. 2200; <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552. Moreover, \"[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchanged throughout a century of careful legislative adjustment.\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 162, n. 9, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 391, 120 S.Ct. 897 (\"The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised\"). In America, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern campaign finance, just like all other laws. To apply a level of scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating electioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self-interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p>This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if there were a solid basis for believing that a legislative action was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents or that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral process.<sup>[68]</sup> See <i>League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry,</i> 548 U.S. 399, 447, 126 S.Ct. 2594, 165 L.Ed.2d 609 (2006) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>Vieth v. Jubelirer,</i> 541 U.S. 267, 317, 124 S.Ct. 1769, 158 L.Ed.2d 546 (2004) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Along with our duty to balance competing constitutional concerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elections remain at least minimally open, fair, and competitive. But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress' years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition. \"Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 31, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>We have no record evidence from which to conclude that BCRA § 203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the Court today calls into question, reflects or fosters such invidious discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that \"`<i>any</i> restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 249, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be turned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*970</span> § 203 might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents have pre-existing relationships with corporations and unions, and groups that wish to procure legislative benefits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting officeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits and is statistically likely to retain office. If a corporation's goal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corporation would do well to cultivate stable, long-term relationships of dependency.</p>\r\n<p>So we do not have a solid theoretical basis for condemning § 203 as a front for incumbent self-protection, and it seems equally if not more plausible that restrictions on corporate electioneering will be self-denying. Nor do we have a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court's failure to cite any empirical research attests. Nor does the legislative history give reason for concern. Congress devoted years of careful study to the issues underlying BCRA; \"[f]ew legislative proposals in recent years have received as much sustained public commentary or news coverage\"; \"[p]olitical scientists and academic experts . . . with no self-interest in incumbent protectio[n] were central figures in pressing the case for BCRA\"; and the legislation commanded bipartisan support from the outset. Pildes, The Supreme Court 2003 Term Foreword: The Constitutionalization of Democratic Politics, 118 Harv. L.Rev. 28, 137 (2004). Finally, it is important to remember just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were prior to BCRA's passage. As the Solicitor General aptly remarked at the time, \"the evidence supports overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under the old system just fine.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>McConnell v. FEC</i><i>,</i> O.T. 2003, No. 02-1674, p. 61. \"It would be hard to develop a scheme that could be better for incumbents.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, then, \"there is no convincing evidence that th[e] important interests favoring expenditure limits are fronts for incumbency protection.\" <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 279, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). \"In the meantime, a legislative judgment that `enough is enough' should command the greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a constitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect relationship to activity that affects the quantity . . . of repetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 279-280, 126 S.Ct. 2479. The majority cavalierly ignores Congress' factual findings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges the validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero. This is quite different from conscientious policing for impermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensitive First Amendment context. It is the denial of Congress' authority to regulate corporate spending on elections.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Austin and Corporate Expenditures</i></h2>\r\n<p>Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general societal interests at stake in campaign finance regulation, it also overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by the regulation of <i>corporate</i> expenditures. The majority fails to appreciate that <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale is itself an anticorruption rationale, see 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (describing \"a different type of corruption\"), tied to the special concerns raised by corporations. Understood properly, \"antidistortion\" is simply a variant on the classic governmental interest in protecting against improper influences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic process. It is manifestly not just an \"`equalizing'\" ideal in disguise. <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612).<sup>[69]</sup></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*971</span> 1. <i>Antidistortion</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>The fact that corporations are different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the majority opinion almost completely elides it. <i>Austin</i> set forth some of the basic differences. Unlike natural persons, corporations have \"limited liability\" for their owners and managers, \"perpetual life,\" separation of ownership and control, \"and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets . . . that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on their shareholders' investments.\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Unlike voters in U.S. elections, corporations may be foreign controlled.<sup>[70]</sup> Unlike other interest groups, business corporations have been \"effectively delegated responsibility for ensuring society's economic welfare\";<sup>[71]</sup> they inescapably structure the life of every citizen. \"`[T]he resources in the treasury of a business corporation,'\" furthermore, \"`are not an indication of popular support for the corporation's political ideas.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616). \"`They reflect instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.'\" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616).<sup>[72]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*972</span> It might also be added that corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their \"personhood\" often serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of \"We the People\" by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.</p>\r\n<p>These basic points help explain why corporate electioneering is not only more likely to impair compelling governmental interests, but also why restrictions on that electioneering are less likely to encroach upon First Amendment freedoms. One fundamental concern of the First Amendment is to \"protec[t] the individual's interest in self-expression.\" <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,</i> 447 U.S. 530, 534, n. 2, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); see also <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 777, n. 12, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Freedom of speech helps \"make men free to develop their faculties,\" <i>Whitney v. California,</i> 274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), it respects their \"dignity and choice,\" <i>Cohen v. California,</i> 403 U.S. 15, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), and it facilitates the value of \"individual self-realization,\" Redish, The Value of Free Speech, 130 U. Pa. L.Rev. 591, 594 (1982). Corporate speech, however, is derivative speech, speech by proxy. A regulation such as BCRA § 203 may affect the way in which individuals disseminate certain messages through the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone from speaking in his or her own voice. \"Within the realm of [campaign spending] generally,\" corporate spending is \"furthest from the core of political expression.\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 161, n. 8, 123 S.Ct. 2200.</p>\r\n<p>It is an interesting question \"who\" is even speaking when a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political preferences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal ends. Some individuals associated with the corporation must make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby fostering their self-expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful. It is entirely possible that the corporation's electoral message will <i>conflict</i> with their personal convictions. Take away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of those ads, and no one's autonomy, dignity, or political equality has been impinged upon in the least.</p>\r\n<p>Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from individual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view that a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on individuals' electioneering expenditures in the service of the governmental interests explained above, and in recognition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct restraints on speech but rather on its financing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Randall,</i> 548 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*973</span> U.S., at 273, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (dissenting opinion). But those restrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the primary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is involved. Some of those individuals might feel that they need to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particular candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral preferences. This is obviously not the situation with business corporations, as their routine practice of giving \"substantial sums to <i>both</i> major national parties\" makes pellucidly clear. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 148, 124 S.Ct. 619. \"[C]orporate participation\" in elections, any business executive will tell you, \"is more transactional than ideological.\" Supp. Brief for Committee for Economic Development as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.</p>\r\n<p>In this transactional spirit, some corporations have affirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their electioneering communications. These corporations fear that officeholders will shake them down for supportive ads, that they will have to spend increasing sums on elections in an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors, and that public trust in business will be eroded. See <i>id.,</i> at 10-19. A system that effectively forces corporations to use their shareholders' money both to maintain access to, and to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ultimately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corporations. It can impose a kind of implicit tax.<sup>[73]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In short, regulations such as § 203 and the statute upheld in <i>Austin</i> impose only a limited burden on First Amendment freedoms not only because they target a narrow subset of expenditures and leave untouched the broader \"public dialogue,\" <i>ante,</i> at 899, but also because they leave untouched the speech of natural persons. Recognizing the weakness of a speaker-based critique of <i>Austin,</i> the Court places primary emphasis not on the corporation's right to electioneer, but rather on the listener's interest in hearing what every possible speaker may have to say. The Court's central argument is that laws such as § 203 have \"`deprived [the electorate] of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 907 (quoting <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 144, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, \"interferes with the `open marketplace' of ideas protected by the First Amendment,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906 (quoting <i>New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres,</i> 552 U.S. 196, 208, 128 S.Ct. 791, 169 L.Ed.2d 665 (2008)).</p>\r\n<p>There are many flaws in this argument. If the overriding concern depends on the interests of the audience, surely the public's perception of the value of corporate speech should be given important weight. That perception today is the same as it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*974</span> was a century ago when Theodore Roosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time, led to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign expenditures that is overruled today. See <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 509-510, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President Roosevelt's remarks). The distinctive threat to democratic integrity posed by corporate domination of politics was recognized at \"the inception of the republic\" and \"has been a persistent theme in American political life\" ever since. Regan 302. It is only certain Members of this Court, not the listeners themselves, who have agitated for more corporate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> recognized that there are substantial reasons why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general treasury expenditures will give corporations \"unfai[r] influence\" in the electoral process, 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391, and distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial resources on a scale few natural persons can match. The structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the corporation's economic interests and the political preferences of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral process with the aim \"to enhance the profitability of the company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a broader or conflicting set of priorities,\" Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11; see also ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations § 2.01(a), p. 55 (1992) (\"[A] corporation . . . should have as its objective the conduct of business activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit and shareholder gain\"). In a state election such as the one at issue in <i>Austin,</i> the interests of nonresident corporations may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of local voters. Consequently, when corporations grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can flood the market with advocacy that bears \"little or no correlation\" to the ideas of natural persons or to any broader notion of the public good, 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The opinions of real people may be marginalized. \"The expenditure restrictions of [2 U.S.C.] § 441b are thus meant to ensure that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas.\" <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 259, 107 S.Ct. 616.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorporate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon thereafter. Corporate \"domination\" of electioneering, <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, can generate the impression that corporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn on their televisions and radios before an election and hear only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy. A Government captured by corporate interests, they may come to believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor willing to give their views a fair hearing. The predictable result is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased perception that large spenders \"`call the tune'\" and a reduced \"`willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897). To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those races may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation. On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*975</span> might diminish the ability of citizens to \"hold officials accountable to the people,\" <i>ante,</i> at 898, and disserve the goal of a public debate that is \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\" <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature is entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored measures in response.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's unwillingness to distinguish between corporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possibility that corporations' \"war chests\" and their special \"advantages\" in the legal realm, <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, may translate into special advantages in the market for legislation. When large numbers of citizens have a common stake in a measure that is under consideration, it may be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on behalf of their position. The corporate form, by contrast, \"provides a simple way to channel rents to only those who have paid their dues, as it were. If you do not own stock, you do not benefit from the larger dividends or appreciation in the stock price caused by the passage of private interest legislation.\" Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech, Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate Charters, 69 U. Chi. L.Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corporations, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that favor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of money but because of their legal and organizational structure. Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and the door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is \"far more destructive\" than what noncorporations are capable of. <i>Ibid.</i> It is for reasons such as these that our campaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that \"the `differing structures and purposes' of different entities `may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process.'\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, 103 S.Ct. 552 (quoting <i>California Medical Assn.,</i> 453 U.S., at 201, 101 S.Ct. 2712).</p>\r\n<p>The Court's facile depiction of corporate electioneering assumes away all of these complexities. Our colleagues ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on \"nothing more\" than a fear that corporations have a special \"ability to persuade,\" <i>ante,</i> at 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), as if corporations were our society's ablest debaters and viewpoint-neutral laws such as § 203 were created to suppress their best arguments. In their haste to knock down yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore the fundamental concerns of the <i>Austin</i> Court and the legislatures that have passed laws like § 203: to safeguard the integrity, competitiveness, and democratic responsiveness of the electoral process. All of the majority's theoretical arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experience, \"that there is no such thing as too much speech,\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 695, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).<sup>[74]</sup> If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority's premise would be sound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener's exposure to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*976</span> relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens' willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.</p>\r\n<p>None of this is to suggest that corporations can or should be denied an opportunity to participate in election campaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a work of art such as <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> may be banned), or to deny that some corporate speech may contribute significantly to public debate. What it shows, however, is that <i>Austin</i>'s \"concern about corporate domination of the political process,\" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, reflects more than a concern to protect governmental interests outside of the First Amendment. It also reflects a concern to <i>facilitate</i> First Amendment values by preserving some breathing room around the electoral \"marketplace\" of ideas, <i>ante,</i> at 896, 904, 906, 914, 915, the marketplace in which the actual people of this Nation determine how they will govern themselves. The majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as § 203 do not merely pit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First Amendment values against each other. There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any effort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers against the First Amendment rights of listeners. But when the speakers in question are not real people and when the appeal to \"First Amendment principles\" depends almost entirely on the listeners' perspective, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actually be affected.</p>\r\n<p>In critiquing <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale and campaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues place tremendous weight on the example of media corporations. See <i>ante,</i> at 905-907, 911; <i>ante,</i> at 917, 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.); <i>ante,</i> at 927-928 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet it is not at all clear that <i>Austin</i> would permit § 203 to be applied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but also in facilitating public discourse; as the <i>Austin</i> Court explained, \"media corporations differ significantly from other corporations in that their resources are devoted to the collection of information and its dissemination to the public,\" 494 U.S., at 667, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Our colleagues have raised some interesting and difficult questions about Congress' authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and about how to define what constitutes the press. <i>But that is not the case before us.</i> Section 203 does not apply to media corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is not a media corporation. There would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media corporations if the majority did not, first, transform Citizens United's as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, second, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all \"identity\"-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news outlet exactly the same as General Motors.<sup>[75]</sup> This calls to mind George Berkeley's description of philosophers: \"[W]e have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.\" Principles of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, ¶ 3 (R. Woolhouse ed.1988).</p>\r\n<p>It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues feared that a campaign finance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*977</span> regulation such as § 203 may be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore attended carefully to the choices the Legislature has made. But the majority does not bother to consider such practical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply stipulates that \"enlightened self-government\" can arise only in the absence of regulation. <i>Ante,</i> at 898. In light of the distinctive features of corporations identified in <i>Austin,</i> there is no valid basis for this assumption. The marketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items or lawsare meant to be bought and sold, and when we move from the realm of economics to the realm of corporate electioneering, there may be no \"reason to think the market ordering is intrinsically good at all,\" Strauss 1386.</p>\r\n<p>The Court's blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well promote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the Amendment was meant to serve. It will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process. Americans may be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-government today.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2. <i>Shareholder Protection</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>There is yet another way in which laws such as § 203 can serve First Amendment values. Interwoven with <i>Austin</i>'s concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not \"reflec[t] [their] support.\" 494 U.S., at 660-661, 110 S.Ct. 1391. When corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill. Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation's electoral message may find their financial investments being used to undermine their political convictions.</p>\r\n<p>The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that those who pay for an electioneering communication actually support its content and that managers do not use general treasuries to advance personal agendas. <i>Ibid.</i> It \"`allows corporate political participation without the temptation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 204, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163, 123 S.Ct. 2200). A rule that privileges the use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of dissenters. <i>Austin</i>'s acceptance of restrictions on general treasury spending \"simply allows people who have invested in the business corporation for purely economic reasons\"the vast majority of investors, one assumes\"to avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their economic objectives.\" Winkler, Beyond <i>Bellotti,</i> 32 Loyola (LA) L.Rev. 133, 201 (1998).</p>\r\n<p>The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and union members has a long history in campaign finance reform. It provided a central motivation for the Tillman Act in 1907 and subsequent legislation, see <i>Pipefitters v. United States,</i> 407 U.S. 385, 414-415, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972); Winkler, 92 Geo. L. J., at 887-900, and it has been endorsed in a long line of our cases, see, <i>e.g., McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 204-205, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 152-154, 123 S.Ct. 2200; <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552; <i>Pipefitters,</i> 407 U.S., at 414-416, 92 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> S.Ct. 2247; see also n. 60, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, we have unanimously recognized the governmental interest in \"protect[ing] the individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates from having that money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed.\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552.</p>\r\n<p>The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that abuses of shareholder money can be corrected \"through the procedures of corporate democracy,\" <i>ante,</i> at 911 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through Internet-based disclosures, <i>ante,</i> at 916.<sup>[76]</sup> I fail to understand how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union members, who will also be affected by today's ruling, and I fail to understand why the Court is so confident in these mechanisms. By \"corporate democracy,\" presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that \"these rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,\" given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule. Blair &amp; Stout 320; see also <i>id.,</i> at 298-315; Winkler, 32 Loyola (LA) L.Rev., at 165-166, 199-200. Modern technology may help make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but it is utopian to believe that it solves the problem. Most American households that own stock do so through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans, see Evans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. L.Rev. 1105 (2009), which makes it more difficult both to monitor and to alter particular holdings. Studies show that a majority of individual investors make no trades at all during a given year. <i>Id.,</i> at 1117. Moreover, if the corporation in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees the company's ads may not know whether they are being funded through the PAC or through the general treasury.</p>\r\n<p>If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been spending general treasury money on objectionable electioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only partial. The injury to the shareholders' expressive rights has already occurred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation's stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like. The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable contributions in ways that any particular shareholder might disapprove. But those expenditures do not implicate the selection of public officials, an area in which \"the interests of unwilling . . . corporate shareholders [in not being] forced to subsidize that speech\" \"are at their zenith.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 677, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Brennan, J., concurring). And in any event, the question is whether shareholder protection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in the weeks before an election, not whether additional types of corporate communications <span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> might similarly be conditioned on voluntariness.</p>\r\n<p>Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection rationale, the <i>Austin</i> Court did not hold it out as an adequate and independent ground for sustaining the statute in question. Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the antidistortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the problem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if electioneering expenditures can advance the political views of some members of a corporation, they will often compromise the views of others. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 663, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (discussing risk that corporation's \"members may be . . . reluctant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with [its] political expression\"). Second, it provides an additional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the corporate form, for doubting that these \"expenditures reflect actual public support for the political ideas espoused,\" <i>id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The shareholder protection rationale, in other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on corporate electioneering can serve both speakers' and listeners' interests, as well as the anticorruption interest. And it supplies yet another reason why corporate expenditures merit less protection than individual expenditures.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>V</h2>\r\n<p>Today's decision is backwards in many senses. It elevates the majority's agenda over the litigants' submissions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitutional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over reality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that <i>Austin</i> must be overruled and that § 203 is facially unconstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the Court's lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding corruption and the appearance of corruption does not provide an adequate justification for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate elections relies on an incorrect description of that interest, along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of established facts and the considered judgments of state and federal legislatures over many decades.</p>\r\n<p>In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules. The majority's rejection of this principle \"elevate[s] corporations to a level of deference which has not been seen at least since the days when substantive due process was regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 817, n. 13, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (White, J., dissenting). At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.</p>\r\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\r\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\r\n<p>I join all but Part IV of the Court's opinion.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*980</span> Political speech is entitled to robust protection under the First Amendment. Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been reconcilable with that protection. By striking down § 203, the Court takes an important first step toward restoring full constitutional protection to speech that is \"indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government.\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 265, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted). I dissent from Part IV of the Court's opinion, however, because the Court's constitutional analysis does not go far enough. The disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in BCRA §§ 201 and 311 are also unconstitutional. See <i>id.,</i> at 275-277, and n. 10, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Congress may not abridge the \"right to anonymous speech\" based on the \"`simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 276, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 334, 348, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995)). In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court misapprehends the import of \"recent events\" that some <i>amici</i> describe \"in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 916. The Court properly recognizes these events as \"cause for concern,\" <i>ibid.,</i> but fails to acknowledge their constitutional significance. In my view, <i>amici</i>'s submissions show why the Court's insistence on upholding §§ 201 and 311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated) as was its prior approval of § 203.</p>\r\n<p><i>Amici</i>'s examples relate principally to Proposition 8, a state ballot proposition that California voters narrowly passed in the 2008 general election. Proposition 8 amended California's constitution to provide that \"[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Cal. Const., Art. I, § 7.5. Any donor who gave more than $100 to any committee supporting or opposing Proposition 8 was required to disclose his full name, street address, occupation, employer's name (or business name, if self-employed), and the total amount of his contributions.<sup>[1]</sup> See Cal. Govt.Code Ann. § 84211(f) (West 2005). The California Secretary of State was then required to post this information on the Internet. See §§ 84600-84601; §§ 84602-84602.1 (West Supp.2010); §§ 84602.5-84604 (West 2005); § 85605 (West Supp.2010); §§ 84606-84609 (West 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this information and created Web sites with maps showing the locations of homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters. Many supporters (or their customers) suffered property damage, or threats of physical violence or death, as a result. They cited these incidents in a complaint they filed after the 2008 election, seeking to invalidate California's mandatory disclosure laws. Supporters recounted being told: \"Consider yourself lucky. If I had a gun I would have gunned you down along with each and every other supporter,\" or, \"we have plans for you and your friends.\" Complaint in <i>ProtectMarriage.comYes on 8 v. Bowen,</i> Case No. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*981</span> 2:09-cv-00058-MCE-DAD (ED Cal.), ¶ 31. Proposition 8 opponents also allegedly harassed the measure's supporters by defacing or damaging their property. <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 32. Two religious organizations supporting Proposition 8 reportedly received through the mail envelopes containing a white powdery substance. <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 33.</p>\r\n<p>Those accounts are consistent with media reports describing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director of the nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists complained to his employer. Lott &amp; Smith, Donor Disclosure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, p. A13. The director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because opponents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival. <i>Ibid.</i> And a woman who had managed her popular, family-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she gave $100, because \"throngs of [angry] protesters\" repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and \"shout[ed] `shame on you' at customers.\" Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1. The police even had to \"arriv[e] in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob\" at the restaurant. <i>Ibid.</i> Some supporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real estate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a group opposing Proposition 8 \"received a letter from the Prop. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his company's name if he didn't also donate to the `Yes on 8' campaign.\" Donor Disclosure, <i>supra,</i> at A13.</p>\r\n<p>The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed donor information to <i>pre-empt</i> citizens' exercise of their First Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential election, a \"newly formed nonprofit group ... plann[ed] to confront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions.\" Luo, Group Plans Campaign Against G.O.P. Donors, N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2008, p. A15. Its leader, \"who described his effort as `going for the jugular,'\" detailed the group's plan to send a \"warning letter ... alerting donors who might be considering giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential dangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate why this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements. But <i>amici</i> present evidence of yet another reason to do so  the threat of retaliation from <i>elected officials.</i> As <i>amici</i>'s submissions make clear, this threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition in California. For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent state attorney general reported that some members of the State's business community feared donating to his campaign because they did not want to cross the incumbent; in his words, \"`I go to so many people and hear the same thing: \"I sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but I can't afford to have my name on your records. He might come after me next.\"'\" Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism at the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11. The incumbent won reelection in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>My point is not to express any view on the merits of the political controversies I describe. Rather, it is to demonstrate  using real-world, recent examples  the fallacy in the Court's conclusion that \"[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements ... impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 914 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*982</span> course they do. Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and elected officials to implement political strategies <i>specifically calculated</i> to curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied challenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate those speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can \"show a reasonable probability that disclosure... will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 914 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court's opinion itself proves the irony in this compromise. In correctly explaining why it must address the facial constitutionality of § 203, see <i>ante,</i> at 888-897, the Court recognizes that \"[t]he First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to ... seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day,\" <i>ante,</i> at 889; that as-applied challenges to § 203 \"would require substantial litigation over an extended time\" and result in an \"interpretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 891; that \"a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling,\" <i>ante,</i> at 892; and that avoiding a facial challenge to § 203 \"would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect\" that § 203 causes, <i>ante,</i> at 894. This logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied challenges to §§ 201 and 311.</p>\r\n<p>Irony aside, the Court's promise that as-applied challenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assurance. Now more than ever, §§ 201 and 311 will chill protected speech because  as California voters can attest  \"the advent of the Internet\" enables \"prompt disclosure of expenditures,\" which \"provide[s]\" political opponents \"with the information needed\" to intimidate and retaliate against their foes. <i>Ante,</i> at 916. Thus, \"disclosure permits citizens ... to react to the speech of [their political opponents] in a proper\"  or undeniably <i>improper</i>  \"way\" long before a plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment that subjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined careers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and threatening warning letters as the price for engaging in \"core political speech, the `primary object of First Amendment protection.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 264, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 410-411, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (THOMAS, J., dissenting)). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment upholding BCRA §§ 201 and 311.</p>\r\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\r\n<p>[1]  The dissent suggests that I am \"much too quick\" to reach this conclusion because I \"ignore\" Citizens United's narrower arguments. <i>Post,</i> at 936, n. 12. But in fact I do not ignore those arguments; on the contrary, I (and my colleagues in the majority) appropriately consider and reject them on their merits, before addressing Citizens United's broader claims. <i>Supra,</i> at 918-919; <i>ante,</i> at 888-892.</p>\r\n<p>[2]  See also, <i>e.g.,</i> R.

I used 1800 only because the dissent did. But in any case, it is surely fanciful to think that a consensus of hostility towards corporations was transformed into general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and 1796.</p>\r\n<p>[3]  \"[P]eople in 1800 identified corporations with franchised monopolies.\" L. Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed.1985) (hereinafter Friedman). \"The chief cause for the changed popular attitude towards business corporations that marked the opening of the nineteenth century was the elimination of their inherent monopolistic character. This was accomplished primarily by an extension of the principle of free incorporation under general laws.\" 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 2, p. 8 (rev. ed.2006).</p>\r\n<p>[4]  At times (though not always) the dissent seems to exclude such non-\"business corporations\" from its denial of free speech rights. See <i>post,</i> at 949-950. Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the rights of business corporations and the rights of non-business corporations is even more imaginative than finding a distinction between the rights of <i>all</i> corporations and the rights of other associations.</p>\r\n<p>[5]  The best the dissent can come up with is that \"[p]ostratification practice\" supports its reading of the First Amendment. <i>Post,</i> at 951, n. 56. For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White's statement (in dissent) that \"[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 819, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). The sole authority Justice White cited for this proposition, <i>id.,</i> at 819, n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1407, was a law-review note that made no such claim. To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing with the propriety of corporate political expenditures were \"few.\" Note, Corporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961). More specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by a Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana. <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 197. Of course even if the common law was \"generally interpreted\" to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires, that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that <i>were</i> authorized by a corporation's charter could constitutionally be suppressed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>As additional \"[p]ostratification practice,\" the dissent notes that the Court \"did not recognize <i>any</i> First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century.\" <i>Post,</i> at 951, n. 56. But it did that in <i>Grosjean v. American Press Co.,</i> 297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936), a case involving freedom of the presswhich the dissent acknowledges <i>did</i> cover corporations from the outset. The relative recency of that first case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence was slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until 1919, see <i>Schenck v. United States,</i> 249 U.S. 47, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); we did not invalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see <i>Stromberg v. California,</i> 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and a federal law until 1965, see <i>Lamont v. Postmaster General,</i> 381 U.S. 301, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 14 L.Ed.2d 398 (1965).</p>\r\n<p>[6]  The dissent seeks to avoid this conclusion (and to turn a liability into an asset) by interpreting the Freedom of the Press Clause to refer to the institutional press (thus demonstrating, according to the dissent, that the Founders \"did draw distinctionsexplicit distinctionsbetween types of `speakers,' or speech outlets or forms\"). <i>Post,</i> at 951-952 and n. 57. It is passing strange to interpret the phrase \"the freedom of speech, or of the press\" to mean, not everyone's right to speak or publish, but rather everyone's right to speak or the institutional press's right to publish. No one thought that is what it meant. Patriot Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary contains, under the word \"press,\" the following entry:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"<i>Liberty of the press,</i> in civil policy, is the free right of publishing books, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unrestrained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and opinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious to morals or to the peace of the state.\" 2 American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).</p>\r\n<p>As the Court's opinion describes, <i>ante,</i> at 905-906, our jurisprudence agrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.</p>\r\n<p>\"The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets.... The press in its historical connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion.\" <i>Lovell v. City of Griffin,</i> 303 U.S. 444, 452, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938).</p>\r\n<p>[7]  The dissent says that \"`speech'\" refers to oral communications of human beings, and since corporations are not human beings they cannot speak. <i>Post,</i> at 950, n. 55. This is sophistry. The authorized spokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of the human beings who have formed that associationjust as the spokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its members. The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to speak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no problem with a corporation's enjoying the freedom of the press.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The same footnote asserts that \"it has been `claimed that the notion of institutional speech ... did not exist in post-revolutionary America.'\" This is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the University of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the sole support for its statement a treatise dealing with government speech, M. Yudof, When Government Speaks 42-50 (1983). The cited pages of that treatise provide no support whatever for the statementunless, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the \"institutional speech\" referred to was speech by the subject of the law-review article, governmental institutions.</p>\r\n<p>The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a professor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L.Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent, in that it would accord free-speech protection to associations.</p>\r\n<p>[1]  Specifically, Part I, <i>infra,</i> at 931-938, addresses the procedural history of the case and the narrower grounds of decision the majority has bypassed. Part II, <i>infra,</i> at 938-942, addresses <i>stare decisis.</i> Part III, <i>infra,</i> at 942-961, addresses the Court's assumptions that BCRA \"bans\" corporate speech, that identity-based distinctions may not be drawn in the political realm, and that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were outliers in our First Amendment tradition. Part IV, <i>infra,</i> at 961-979, addresses the Court's treatment of the anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales for regulating corporate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p>[2]  See <i>Yee v. Escondido,</i> 503 U.S. 519, 535, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992) (\"[U]nder this Court's Rule 14.1(a), only questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); <i>Wood v. Allen,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 841, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2010 WL 173369 *5 (\"[T]he fact that petitioner discussed [an] issue in the text of his petition for certiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the <i>question presented</i> for our review\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 157, 168-169, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004) (\"We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\r\n<p>[3]  The majority states that, in denying Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, the District Court \"addressed\" the facial validity of BCRA § 203. <i>Ante,</i> at 892-893. That is true, in the narrow sense that the court observed the issue was foreclosed by <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). See 530 F.Supp.2d 274, 278 (D.D.C.2008) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Yet as explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its facial challenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) motion for summary judgment, App. 261a-262a, any question about statutory validity had dropped out of the case. That latter ruling by the District Court was the \"final decision\" from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under BCRA § 403(a)(3). As regards the lower court decision that has come before us, the claim that § 203 is facially unconstitutional was neither pressed nor passed upon in any form.</p>\r\n<p>[4]  Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its facial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it \"require[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial challenge.\" 1:07-cv-2240-RCL-RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar. 26, 2008). By reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the Court gives it a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which was deprived of the opportunity to gather and present information necessary to its rebuttal.</p>\r\n<p>[5]  In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how § 203 has been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the District Court the details of <i>Hillary</i>'s funding or its own finances. We likewise have no evidence of how § 203 and comparable state laws were expected to affect corporations and unions in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>It is true, as the majority points out, that the <i>McConnell</i> Court evaluated the facial validity of § 203 in light of an extensive record. See <i>ante,</i> at 893-894. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any event, the majority's argument for striking down § 203 depends on its contention that the statute has proved too \"chilling\" in practiceand in particular on the contention that the controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and \"breathing space\" to this area of law. See <i>ante,</i> at 892, 894-897. We have no record with which to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the burdens of complying with § 203, but we have no meaningful evidence to show how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>[6]  Our cases recognize a \"type of facial challenge in the First Amendment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad because a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional.\" <i>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party,</i> 552 U.S. 442, 449, n. 6, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Citizens United has not made an overbreadth argument, and \"[w]e generally do not apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analysis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). If our colleagues nonetheless concluded that § 203's fatal flaw is that it affects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for overbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissible, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.</p>\r\n<p>[7]  Also perplexing is the majority's attempt to pass blame to the Government for its litigating position. By \"hold[ing] out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from adopting that position,\" the majority says, the Government has caused \"added uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895. Our colleagues have apparently never heard of an alternative argument. Like every litigant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that, it would prefer to lose on a narrow ground. The fact that there are numerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the Government acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything about the propriety of a facial ruling.</p>\r\n<p>[8]  The majority's \"chilling\" argument is particularly inapposite with respect to 2 U.S.C. § 441b's longstanding restriction on the use of corporate general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was ever any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional equivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what counts as express advocacy since the \"magic words\" test of <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 44, n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Yet even though Citizens United's briefs never once mention § 441b's restriction on express advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate chilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that <i>Hillary</i> counts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to opine that this statutory provision is \"invalid\" as well. <i>Ante,</i> at 913.</p>\r\n<p>[9]  The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges does not have \"some automatic effect\" that mechanically controls the judicial task. <i>Ante,</i> at 893. I agree, but it does not follow that in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less invert it.</p>\r\n<p>[10]  Professor Fallon proposes an intricate answer to this question that the majority ignores. Fallon 1327-1359. It bears mention that our colleagues have previously cited Professor Fallon's article for the exact opposite point from the one they wish to make today. In <i>Gonzales v. Carhart,</i> 550 U.S. 124, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007), the Court explained that \"[i]t is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop,\" and \"[f]or this reason, `[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 168, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (opinion for the Court by KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Fallon 1328 (second alteration in original)).</p>\r\n<p>[11]  Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to nonprofit organizations \"operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, ... the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.\"</p>\r\n<p>[12]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE is therefore much too quick when he suggests that, \"[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rightswould mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 919 (concurring opinion). That conclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens United's plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implausible position that <i>all</i> corporations and <i>all</i> types of expenditures enjoy the same First Amendment protections, which <i>always</i> trump the interests in regulation. At times, the majority appears to endorse this extreme view. At other times, however, it appears to suggest that nonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protection than for-profit corporations, see <i>ante,</i> at 897, 907, \"advocacy\" organizations have a better claim than other nonprofits, <i>ante,</i> at 897, domestic corporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 911-912, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 906-908, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast communications, <i>ante,</i> at 904. The majority never uses a multinational business corporation in its hypotheticals.</p>\r\n<p>[13]  The Court entirely ignores this statutory argument. It concludes that § 203 applies to <i>Hillary</i> on the basis of the film's content, <i>ante,</i> at 889-890, without considering the possibility that § 203 does not apply to video-on-demand transmissions generally.</p>\r\n<p>[14]  See <i>Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman,</i> 498 F.3d 1137, 1148 (C.A.10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that \"every other circuit to have addressed this issue\" has done likewise); Brief for Independent Sector as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10-11 (collecting cases). The Court rejects this solution in part because the Government \"merely suggest[s] it\" and \"does not say that it agrees with the interpretation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892. Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing insufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same time that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly abandoned. The Court also protests that a <i>de minimis</i> standard would \"requir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892. But <i>de minimis</i> tests need not be intricate at all. A test that granted <i>MCFL</i> status to § 501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed dollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such donations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets, would be perfectly easy to understand and administer.</p>\r\n<p>[15]  Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have been to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA § 203(c), allowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering communications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace the payments to individual contributions. See Brief for National Rifle Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5-15 (arguing forcefully that Congress intended this result).</p>\r\n<p>[16]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds our discussion of these narrower solutions \"quite perplexing\" because we suggest that the Court should \"latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question,\" without doing the same ourselves. <i>Ante,</i> at 918-919. There is nothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly situated to our colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view of the First Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not lead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this case, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional avoidance or to vindicate Citizens United's as-applied challenge. Each of the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statutory argument the Court accepted in last year's Voting Rights Act case, <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009).</p>\r\n<p>[17]  I will have more to say shortly about the meritsabout why <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and why their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present purposes, I limit the discussion to <i>stare-decisis</i>-specific considerations.</p>\r\n<p>[18]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that <i>Austin</i> has been undermined by subsequent dissenting opinions. <i>Ante,</i> at 934. Under this view, it appears that the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of requests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. THE CHIEF JUSTICE further suggests that <i>Austin</i> \"is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court's decisions even outside\" its particular facts, as when we applied its reasoning in <i>McConnell. Ante,</i> at 922. Once again, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the more we call it into question. For those who believe <i>Austin</i> was correctly decidedas the Federal Government and the States have long believed, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since <i>Austin</i> have believed, and as we continue to believethere is nothing \"destabilizing\" about the prospect of its continued application. It is gutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does today, that will be destabilizing.</p>\r\n<p>[19]  Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging the historical account of campaign finance law given in <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S. 567, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957). <i>Ante,</i> at 912. <i>Austin</i> did not so much as allude to this historical account, much less rely on it. Even if the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign finance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than <i>Automobile Workers</i> suggested, the point remains that this body of law has played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political life for decades upon decades.</p>\r\n<p>[20]  See Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5-13; see also Supp. Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1a-8a (listing 24 States that presently limit or prohibit independent electioneering expenditures from corporate general treasuries).</p>\r\n<p>[21]  Magleby, The Importance of the Record in <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 3 Election L. J. 285 (2004).</p>\r\n<p>[22]  To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the imbalance by removing BCRA's soft-money limits. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of KENNEDY, J.). But this is no response to any legislature that takes campaign finance regulation seriously. It merely illustrates the breadth of the majority's deregulatory vision.</p>\r\n<p>[23]  See Brief for Committee for Economic Development as <i>Amicus Curiae;</i> Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as <i>Amicus Curiae.</i> But see Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae.</i></p>\r\n<p>[24]  See Brief for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3, 9.</p>\r\n<p>[25]  See Brief for Independent Sector as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-20.</p>\r\n<p>[26]  See Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i></p>\r\n<p>[27]  The FEC established this process following the Court's June 2007 decision in that case, 551 U.S. 449, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329. In the brief interval between the establishment of this process and the 2008 election, corporations and unions used it to make $108.5 million in electioneering communications. Supp. Brief for Appellee 22-23; FEC, Electioneering Communication Summary, online at http://fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ ECSummary.shtml (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\r\n<p>[28]  Concededly, <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were constitutional decisions, and we have often said that \"claims of <i>stare decisis</i> are at the weakest in that field, where our mistakes cannot be corrected by Congress.\" <i>Vieth v. Jubelirer,</i> 541 U.S. 267, 305, 124 S.Ct. 1769, 158 L.Ed.2d 546 (2004) (plurality opinion). As a general matter, this principle is a sound one. But the principle only takes on real force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal democratic process; it is the fear of making \"mistakes [that] cannot be corrected by Congress,\" <i>ibid.,</i> that motivates us to review constitutional precedents with a more critical eye. <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> did not obstruct state or congressional legislative power in any way. Although it is unclear how high a bar today's decision will pose to future attempts to regulate corporate electioneering, it will clearly restrain much legislative action.</p>\r\n<p>[29]  See FEC, Number of Federal PAC's Increases, http://fec.gov/press/ press2008/20080812paccount.shtml.</p>\r\n<p>[30]  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 16 (citing FEC statistics placing this figure at $840 million). The majority finds the PAC option inadequate in part because \"[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 897. The formal \"separateness\" of PACs from their host corporationswhich administer and control the PACs but which cannot funnel general treasury funds into them or force members to support themis, of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>[31]  Roaming far afield from the case at hand, the majority worries that the Government will use § 203 to ban books, pamphlets, and blogs. <i>Ante,</i> at 896, 904, 912-913. Yet by its plain terms, § 203 does not apply to printed material. See 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i); see also 11 CFR § 100.29(c)(1) (\"[E]lectioneering communication does not include communications appearing in print media\"). And in light of the ordinary understanding of the terms \"broadcast, cable, [and] satellite,\" § 434(f)(3)(A)(i), coupled with Congress' clear aim of targeting \"a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619, we highly doubt that § 203 could be interpreted to apply to a Web site or book that happens to be transmitted at some stage over airwaves or cable lines, or that the FEC would ever try to do so. See 11 CFR § 100.26 (exempting most Internet communications from regulation as advertising); § 100.155 (exempting uncompensated Internet activity from regulation as an expenditure); Supp. Brief for Center for Independent Media et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 14 (explaining that \"the FEC has consistently construed [BCRA's] media exemption to apply to a variety of non-traditional media\"). If it should, the Government acknowledges \"there would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>[32]  As the Government points out, with a media corporation there is also a lesser risk that investors will not understand, learn about, or support the advocacy messages that the corporation disseminates. Supp. Reply Brief for Appellee 10. Everyone knows and expects that media outlets may seek to influence elections in this way.</p>\r\n<p>[33]  2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i).</p>\r\n<p>[34]  § 434(f)(3)(C).</p>\r\n<p>[35]  § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(II).</p>\r\n<p>[36]  § 441b(b); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 211, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>[37]  § 441b(b)(2)(C).</p>\r\n<p>[38]  <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>[39]  It is likewise nonsense to suggest that the FEC's \"`business is to censor.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 896 (quoting <i>Freedman v. Maryland,</i> 380 U.S. 51, 57, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965)). The FEC's business is to administer and enforce the campaign finance laws. The regulatory body at issue in <i>Freedman</i> was a state <i>Board of Censors</i> that had virtually unfettered discretion to bar distribution of motion picture films it deemed not to be \"moral and proper.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 52-53, and n. 2, 85 S.Ct. 734. No movie could be shown in the State of Maryland that was not first approved and licensed by the Board of Censors. <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 1, 85 S.Ct. 734. It is an understatement to say that <i>Freedman</i> is not on point, and the majority's characterization of the FEC is deeply disconcerting.</p>\r\n<p>[40]  Citizens United has administered this PAC for over a decade. See Defendant FEC's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction in No. 07-2240 (ARR, RCL, RWR) (DC), p. 20. Citizens United also operates multiple \"527\" organizations that engage in partisan political activity. See Defendant FEC's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute in No. 07-2240(DC), ¶¶ 22-24.</p>\r\n<p>[41]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v.

The majority's creative suggestion that these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite implausible. In any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case, as Congress and half the state legislatures have concluded, over many decades, that their core functions of administering elections and passing legislation cannot operate effectively without some narrow restrictions on corporate electioneering paid for by general treasury funds.</p>\r\n<p>[47]  Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity and incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his speech. See Aristotle, Poetics 43-44 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (\"In evaluating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just the moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the identity of the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and the motive\"). The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper subject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer and disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.</p>\r\n<p>[48]  I dissented in <i>Forbes</i> because the broadcaster's decision to exclude the respondent from its debate was done \"on the basis of entirely subjective, ad hoc judgments,\" 523 U.S., at 690, 118 S.Ct. 1633, that suggested anticompetitive viewpoint discrimination, <i>id.,</i> at 693-694, 118 S.Ct. 1633, and lacked a compelling justification. Needless to say, my concerns do not apply to the instant case.</p>\r\n<p>[49]  The law at issue in <i>Burson</i> was far from unusual. \"[A]ll 50 States,\" the Court observed, \"limit access to the areas in or around polling places.\" 504 U.S., at 206, 112 S.Ct. 1846; see also Note, 91 Ky. L. J. 715, 729, n. 89, 747-769 (2003) (collecting statutes). I dissented in <i>Burson</i> because the evidence adduced to justify Tennessee's law was \"exceptionally thin,\" 504 U.S., at 219, 112 S.Ct. 1846, and \"the reason for [the] restriction [had] disappear[ed]\" over time, <i>id.,</i> at 223, 112 S.Ct. 1846. \"In short,\" I concluded, \"Tennessee ha[d] failed to point to any legitimate interest that would justify its selective regulation of campaign-related expression.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 225, 112 S.Ct. 1846. These criticisms are inapplicable to the case before us.</p>\r\n<p>[50]  They are likewise entitled to regulate media corporations differently from other corporations \"to ensure that the law `does not hinder or prevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing editorials about, newsworthy events.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 208, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 668, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990)).</p>\r\n<p>[51]  The Court all but confesses that a categorical approach to speaker identity is untenable when it acknowledges that Congress might be allowed to take measures aimed at \"preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 911. Such measures have been a part of U.S. campaign finance law for many years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers, whose \"obsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country.\" Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.Rev. 341, 393, n. 245 (2009) (hereinafter Teachout); see also U.S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (\"[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust ... shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\"). Professor Teachout observes that a corporation might be analogized to a foreign power in this respect, \"inasmuch as its legal loyalties necessarily exclude patriotism.\" Teachout 393, n. 245.</p>\r\n<p>[52]  See A. Bickel, The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress 59-60 (1978); A. Meiklejohn, Political Freedom: The Constitutional Powers of the People 39-40 (1965); Tokaji, First Amendment Equal Protection: On Discretion, Inequality, and Participation, 101 Mich. L.Rev. 2409, 2508-2509 (2003). Of course, voting is not speech in a pure or formal sense, but then again neither is a campaign expenditure; both are nevertheless communicative acts aimed at influencing electoral outcomes. Cf. Strauss, Corruption, Equality, and Campaign Finance Reform, 94 Colum. L.Rev. 1369, 1383-1384 (1994) (hereinafter Strauss).</p>\r\n<p>[53]  Scholars have found that only a handful of business corporations were issued charters during the colonial period, and only a few hundred during all of the 18th century. See E. Dodd, American Business Corporations Until 1860, p. 197 (1954); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 188-189 (2d ed. 1985); Baldwin, American Business Corporations Before 1789, 8 Am. Hist. Rev. 449, 450-459 (1903). Justice SCALIA quibbles with these figures; whereas we say that \"a few hundred\" charters were issued to business corporations during the 18th century, he says that the number is \"approximately 335.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 925 (concurring opinion). Justice SCALIA also raises the more serious point that it is improper to assess these figures by today's standards, <i>ante,</i> at 926, though I believe he fails to substantiate his claim that \"the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life\" by the century's end, <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). His formulation of that claim is also misleading, because the relevant reference point is not 1800 but the date of the First Amendment's ratification, in 1791. And at that time, the number of business charters must have been significantly smaller than 335, because the pace of chartering only began to pick up steam in the last decade of the 18th century. More than half of the century's total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800. Friedman, History of American Law, at 189.</p>\r\n<p>[54]  See Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Tom Logan (Nov. 12, 1816), in 12 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 42, 44 (P. Ford ed. 1905) (\"I hope we shall ... crush in [its] birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country\").</p>\r\n<p>[55]  In normal usage then, as now, the term \"speech\" referred to oral communications by individuals. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language 1853-1854 (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978) (listing as primary definition of \"speech\": \"The power of articulate utterance; the power of expressing thoughts by vocal words\"); 2 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970) (listing as primary definition of \"speech\": \"The faculty of uttering articulate sounds or words, as in human beings; the faculty of expressing thoughts by words or articulate sounds. <i>Speech</i> was given to man by his Creator for the noblest purposes\"). Indeed, it has been \"claimed that the notion of institutional speech ... did not exist in post-revolutionary America.\" Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006); see also Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995) (\"In the intellectual heritage of the eighteenth century, the idea that free speech was individual and personal was deeply rooted and clearly manifest in the writings of Locke, Milton, and others on whom the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights drew\"). Given that corporations were conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical capacity to \"speak,\" the burden of establishing that the Framers and ratifiers understood \"the freedom of speech\" to encompass corporate speech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p>[56]  Postratification practice bolsters the conclusion that the First Amendment, \"as originally understood,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906, did not give corporations political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals. Well into the modern era of general incorporation statutes, \"[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 819, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (White, J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize <i>any</i> First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century, see <i>ante,</i> at 899-900 (listing cases).</p>\r\n<p>[57]  In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against Justice SCALIA, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctionsexplicit distinctionsbetween types of \"speakers,\" or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court's strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers' views on the press, see <i>ante,</i> at 906-907; <i>ante,</i> at 926-928 (SCALIA, J., concurring), yet while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of \"identity\"-based distinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that much, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.</p>\r\n<p>[58]  Cf. L. Levy, Legacy of Suppression: Freedom of Speech and Press in Early American History 4 (1960) (\"The meaning of no other clause of the Bill of Rights at the time of its framing and ratification has been so obscure to us\" as the Free Speech and Press Clause).</p>\r\n<p>[59]  As the majority notes, there is some academic debate about the precise origins of these developments. <i>Ante,</i> at 912; see also n. 19, <i>supra.</i> There is <i>always</i> some academic debate about such developments; the motives of legislatures are never entirely clear or unitary. Yet the basic shape and trajectory of 20th-century campaign finance reform are clear, and one need not take a naïve or triumphalist view of this history to find it highly relevant. The Court's skepticism does nothing to mitigate the absurdity of its claim that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were outliers. Nor does it alter the fact that five Justices today destroy a longstanding American practice.</p>\r\n<p>[60]  See <i>Pipefitters v. United States,</i> 407 U.S. 385, 409, 414-415, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972) (reading the statutory bar on corporate and union campaign spending not to apply to \"the voluntary donations of employees,\" when maintained in a separate account, because \"[t]he dominant [legislative] concern in requiring that contributions be voluntary was, after all, to protect the dissenting stockholder or union member\"); <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 592, 77 S.Ct. 529 (advising the District Court to consider on remand whether the broadcast in question was \"paid for out of the general dues of the union membership or [whether] the funds [could] be fairly said to have obtained on a voluntary basis\"); <i>United States v. CIO,</i> 335 U.S. 106, 123, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948) (observing that \"funds voluntarily contributed [by union members or corporate stockholders] for election purposes\" might not be covered by the expenditure bar). Both the <i>Pipefitters</i> and the <i>Automobile Workers</i> Court approvingly referenced Congress' goal of reducing \"the effect of aggregated wealth on federal elections,\" understood as wealth drawn from a corporate or union general treasury without the stockholders' or members' \"free and knowing choice.\" <i>Pipefitters,</i> 407 U.S., at 416, 92 S.Ct. 2247; see <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 582, 77 S.Ct. 529.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The two dissenters in <i>Pipefitters</i> would not have read the statutory provision in question, a successor to § 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, to allow such robust use of corporate and union funds to finance otherwise prohibited electioneering. \"This opening of the door to extensive corporate and union influence on the elective and legislative processes,\" Justice Powell wrote, \"must be viewed with genuine concern. This seems to me to be a regressive step as contrasted with the numerous legislative and judicial actions in recent years designed to assure that elections are indeed free and representative.\" 407 U.S., at 450, 92 S.Ct. 2247 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>[61]  Specifically, these corporations had to meet three conditions. First, they had to be formed \"for the express purpose of promoting political ideas,\" so that their resources reflected political support rather than commercial success. <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 264, 107 S.Ct. 616. Next, they had to have no shareholders, so that \"persons connected with the organization will have no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Finally, they could not be \"established by a business corporation or a labor union,\" nor \"accept contributions from such entities,\" lest they \"serv[e] as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>[62]  According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, we are \"erroneou[s]\" in claiming that <i>McConnell</i> and <i>Beaumont</i> \"`reaffirmed'\" <i>Austin. Ante,</i> at 919-920. In both cases, the Court explicitly relied on <i>Austin</i> and quoted from it at length. See 540 U.S., at 204-205, 124 S.Ct. 619, 539 U.S., at 153-155, 158, 160, 163, 123 S.Ct. 2200; see also <i>ante,</i> at 893-894 (\"The holding and validity of <i>Austin</i> were essential to the reasoning of the <i>McConnell</i> majority opinion\"); Brief for Appellants National Rifle Association et al., O.T. 2003, No. 02-1675, p. 21 (\"<i>Beaumont</i> reaffirmed . . . the <i>Austin</i> rationale for restricting expenditures\"). The <i>McConnell</i> Court did so in the teeth of vigorous protests by Justices in today's majority that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled. See <i>ante,</i> at 893-894 (citing relevant passages); see also <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163-164, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Both Courts also heard criticisms of <i>Austin</i> from parties or <i>amici.</i> See Brief for Appellants Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al., O.T.2003, No. 02-1756, p. 35, n. 22; Reply Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch McConnell et al., O.T. 2003, No. 02-1674, pp. 13-14; Brief for Pacific Legal Foundation as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in <i>FEC v. Beaumont</i><i>,</i> O.T. 2002, No. 02-403, <i>passim.</i> If this does not qualify as reaffirmation of a precedent, then I do not know what would.</p>\r\n<p>[63]  Cf. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 389, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (recognizing \"the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors\"). Though discrete in scope, these experiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a chance at functioning effectively and preserving the public's trust. \"Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619. There should be nothing controversial about the proposition that the influence being targeted is \"undue.\" In a democracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim of placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the benefactor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its arguments are seen as especially persuasive.</p>\r\n<p>[64]  The majority declares by fiat that the appearance of undue influence by high-spending corporations \"will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 910. The electorate itself has consistently indicated otherwise, both in opinion polls, see <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 176, 557-558, 623-624 (D.D.C.2003) (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.), and in the laws its representatives have passed, and our colleagues have no basis for elevating their own optimism into a tenet of constitutional law.</p>\r\n<p>[65]  Quite distinct from the interest in preventing improper influences on the electoral process, I have long believed that \"a number of [other] purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign.\" <i>Davis v. FEC,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2779, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). In my judgment, such limitations may be justified to the extent they are tailored to \"improving the quality of the exposition of ideas\" that voters receive, <i>ibid.,</i> \"free[ing] candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted), and \"protect[ing] equal access to the political arena,\" <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 278, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). I continue to adhere to these beliefs, but they have not been briefed by the parties or <i>amici</i> in this case, and their soundness is immaterial to its proper disposition.</p>\r\n<p>[66]  In fact, the notion that the \"electioneering communications\" covered by § 203 can breed <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption or the appearance of such corruption has only become more plausible since we decided <i>McConnell.</i> Recall that THE CHIEF JUSTICE's controlling opinion in <i>WRTL</i> subsequently limited BCRA's definition of \"electioneering communications\" to those that are \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652. The upshot was that after <i>WRTL,</i> a corporate or union expenditure could be regulated under § 203 only if everyone would understand it as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office. It does not take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy might be especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.</p>\r\n<p>[67]  \"We must give weight\" and \"due deference\" to Congress' efforts to dispel corruption, the Court states at one point. <i>Ante,</i> at 911. It is unclear to me what these maxims mean, but as applied by the Court they clearly do not entail \"deference\" in any normal sense of that term.</p>\r\n<p>[68]  Justice BREYER has suggested that we strike the balance as follows: \"We should defer to [the legislature's] political judgment that unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process. But we should not defer in respect to whether its solution . . . insulates legislators from effective electoral challenge.\" <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 403-404, 120 S.Ct. 897 (concurring opinion).</p>\r\n<p>[69]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE denies this, <i>ante,</i> at 921-923, citing scholarship that has interpreted <i>Austin</i> to endorse an equality rationale, along with an article by Justice Thurgood Marshall's former law clerk that states that Marshall, the author of <i>Austin,</i> accepted \"equality of opportunity\" and \"equalizing access to the political process\" as bases for campaign finance regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall's Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 667-668 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is fair to say that <i>Austin</i> can bear an egalitarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this characterization of Justice Marshall's beliefs. But the fact that <i>Austin</i> can be read a certain way hardly proves THE CHIEF JUSTICE's charge that there is nothing more to it. Many of our precedents can bear multiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some \"equalizing\" implications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our takings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure. More important, the <i>Austin</i> Court expressly declined to rely on a speech-equalization rationale, see 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391, and we have never understood <i>Austin</i> to stand for such a rationale. Whatever his personal views, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests he did; indeed, he \"would have viewed it as irresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale based on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would have even considered joining,\" Garrett, 52 Howard L. J., at 674.</p>\r\n<p>[70]  In state elections, even domestic corporations may be \"foreign\"-controlled in the sense that they are incorporated in another jurisdiction and primarily owned and operated by out-of-state residents.</p>\r\n<p>[71]  Regan, Corporate Speech and Civic Virtue, in Debating Democracy's Discontent 289, 302 (A. Allen &amp; M. Regan eds. 1998) (hereinafter Regan).</p>\r\n<p>[72]  Nothing in this analysis turns on whether the corporation is conceptualized as a grantee of a state concession, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> 4 Wheat. 518, 636, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Marshall, C. J.), a nexus of explicit and implicit contracts, see, <i>e.g.,</i> F. Easterbrook &amp; D. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 12 (1991), a mediated hierarchy of stakeholders, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Blair &amp; Stout, A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law, 85 Va. L. Rev. 247 (1999) (hereinafter Blair &amp; Stout), or any other recognized model. <i>Austin</i> referred to the structure and the advantages of corporations as \"state-conferred\" in several places, 494 U.S., at 660, 665, 667, 110 S.Ct. 1391, but its antidistortion argument relied only on the basic descriptive features of corporations, as sketched above. It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the corporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in fundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to regulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its concern. Cf. Hansmann &amp; Kraakman 441, n. 5.</p>\r\n<p>[73]  Not all corporations support BCRA § 203, of course, and not all corporations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts. Some nonprofit corporations are created for an ideological purpose. Some closely held corporations are strongly identified with a particular owner or founder. The fact that § 203, like the statute at issue in <i>Austin,</i> regulates some of these corporations' expenditures does not disturb the analysis above. See 494 U.S., at 661-665, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Small-business owners may speak in their own names, rather than the business', if they wish to evade § 203 altogether. Nonprofit corporations that want to make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they refuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to disassociate without economic penalty. See <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 264, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986). Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a concern about BCRA's coverage of nonprofits that have ideological missions but lack <i>MCFL</i> status, our colleagues refuse to apply the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment or the lower courts' <i>de minimis</i> exception to <i>MCFL.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 891-892.</p>\r\n<p>[74]  Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, classroom, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.</p>\r\n<p>[75]  Under the majority's view, the legislature is thus damned if it does and damned if it doesn't. If the legislature gives media corporations an exemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corporations, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against identity-based distinctions. If the legislature does not give media corporations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of the press. The only way out of this invented bind: no regulations whatsoever.</p>\r\n<p>[76]  I note that, among the many other regulatory possibilities it has left open, ranging from new versions of § 203 supported by additional evidence of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption or its appearance to any number of tax incentive or public financing schemes, today's decision does not require that a legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect shareholders. Legislatures remain free in their incorporation and tax laws to condition the types of activity in which corporations may engage, including electioneering activity, on specific disclosure requirements or on prior express approval by shareholders or members.</p>\r\n<p>[1]  BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(2)(F) (\"Every person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any calendar year\" must disclose \"the names and addresses of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making the disbursement\").</p>\r\n<p>[2]  But cf. <i>Hill v. Colorado,</i> 530 U.S. 703, 707-710, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (approving a statute restricting speech \"within 100 feet\" of abortion clinics because it protected women seeking an abortion from \"`sidewalk counseling,'\" which \"consists of efforts `to educate, counsel, persuade, or inform passersby about abortion and abortion alternatives by means of verbal or written speech,'\" and which \"sometimes\" involved \"strong and abusive language in face-to-face encounters\")​.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\r\n<center><b>130 S.Ct. 876 (2010)</b></center>\r\n<center><h1>CITIZENS UNITED, Appellant,<br>\r\nv.<br>\r\nFEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.</h1></center>\r\n<center>No. 08-205.</center>\r\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\r\n<center>Argued March 24, 2009.</center>\r\n<center>Decided January 21, 2010.</center>\r\n<center>Reargued September 9, 2009.</center>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*886</span> Theodore B.

Limits on electioneering communications were upheld in <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). The holding of <i>McConnell</i> rested to a large extent on an earlier case, <i>Austin v.

We agree with that conclusion and hold that <i>stare decisis</i> does not compel the continued acceptance of <i>Austin.</i> The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether. We turn to the case now before us.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*887</span> Columbia. A three-judge court later convened to hear the cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to this appeal.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12 million. Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled <i>Hillary: The Movie.</i> We refer to the film as <i>Hillary.</i> It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party's 2008 Presidential primary elections. <i>Hillary</i> mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton. <i>Hillary</i> was released in theaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by making it available through video-on-demand.</p>\r\n<p>Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select programming from various menus, including movies, television shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer can watch the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause the program. In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make <i>Hillary</i> available on a video-on-demand channel called \"Elections '08.\" App. 255a-257a. Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small fee to view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make <i>Hillary</i> available to viewers free of charge.</p>\r\n<p>To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for <i>Hillary.</i> Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie's Website address. <i>Id.,</i> at 26a-27a. Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand offering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibitedand still does prohibit corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections. 2 U.S.C. § 441b (2000 ed.); see <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 204, and n. 87, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-fo/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 249, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) <i>(MCFL).</i> BCRA § 203 amended § 441b to prohibit any \"electioneering communication\" as well. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.). An electioneering communication is defined as \"any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\" that \"refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\" and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. § 434(f)(3)(A). The Federal Election Commission's (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a communication that is \"publicly distributed.\" 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2) (2009). \"In the case of a candidate for nomination for President ... <i>publicly distributed</i> means\" that the communication \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election ... is being held within 30 days.\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a \"separate segregated fund\" (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> § 441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United wanted to make <i>Hillary</i> available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections. It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by § 441b's ban on corporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under § 437g. In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) § 441b is unconstitutional as applied to <i>Hillary;</i> and (2) BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§ 201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to <i>Hillary</i> and to the three ads for the movie.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court denied Citizens United's motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F.Supp.2d 274 (D.D.C.2008) <i>(per curiam),</i> and then granted the FEC's motion for summary judgment, App. 261a-262a. See <i>id.,</i> at 261a (\"Based on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that the [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See </i><i>Citizen[s] United v. FEC,</i> 530 F.Supp.2d 274 (D.D.C.2008) (denying Citizens United's request for a preliminary injunction)\"). The court held that § 441b was facially constitutional under <i>McConnell,</i> and that § 441b was constitutional as applied to <i>Hillary</i> because it was \"susceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.\" 530 F.Supp.2d, at 279. The court also rejected Citizens United's challenge to BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It noted that \"the Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though the speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 281.</p>\r\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction. 555 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1471, 170 L.Ed.2d 294 (2008). The case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether we should overrule either or both <i>Austin</i> and the part of <i>McConnell</i> which addresses the facial validity of 2 U.S.C. § 441b. See 557 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1732, 170 L.Ed.2d 511 (2009).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>Before considering whether <i>Austin</i> should be overruled, we first address whether Citizens United's claim that § 441b cannot be applied to <i>Hillary</i> may be resolved on other, narrower grounds.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United contends that § 441b does not cover <i>Hillary,</i> as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the film does not qualify as an \"electioneering communication.\" § 441b(b)(2). Citizens United raises this issue for the first time before us, but we consider the issue because \"it was addressed by the court below.\" <i>Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117895\"><a href=\"/opinion/117895/lebron-v-national-railroad-passenger-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 379, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995); see 530 F.Supp.2d, at 277, n. 6. Under the definition of electioneering communication, the video-on-demand showing of <i>Hillary</i> on cable television would have been a \"cable... communication\" that \"refer[red] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\" and that was made within 30 days of a primary election. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i). Citizens United, however, argues that <i>Hillary</i> was not \"publicly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> distributed,\" because a single video-on-demand transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each separate transmission, in most instances, will be seen by just one householdnot 50,000 or more persons. 11 CFR § 100.29(a)(2); see § 100.29(b)(3)(ii).</p>\r\n<p>This argument ignores the regulation's instruction on how to determine whether a cable transmission \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons.\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii). The regulation provides that the number of people who can receive a cable transmission is determined by the number of cable subscribers in the relevant area. §§ 100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, <i>Hillary</i> could have been received by 50,000 persons or more.</p>\r\n<p>One <i>amici</i> brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the condition that the communication \"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons,\" § 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require \"a plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed by 50,000 or more potential voters\"as opposed to requiring only that the communication is \"technologically capable\" of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5. Whether the population and demographic statistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000 registered votersbut not \"infants, pre-teens, or otherwise electorally ineligible recipients\" would be a required determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in any case where the issue was in doubt. <i>Id.,</i> at 6.</p>\r\n<p>In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the reach of 2 U.S.C. § 441b through this suggested interpretation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this result would require a calculation as to the number of people a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker to criminal sanctions. The First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day. Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech: People \"of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the law's] meaning and differ as to its application.\" <i>Connally v. General Constr. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100759\"><a href=\"/opinion/100759/connally-v-general-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). The Government may not render a ban on political speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption through an amorphous regulatory interpretation. We must reject the approach suggested by the <i>amici.</i> Section 441b covers <i>Hillary.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United next argues that § 441b may not be applied to <i>Hillary</i> under the approach taken in <i>WRTL. McConnell</i> decided that § 441b(b)(2)'s definition of an \"electioneering communication\" was facially constitutional insofar as it restricted speech that was \"the functional equivalent of express advocacy\" for or against a specific candidate. 540 U.S., at 206, 124 S.Ct. 619. <i>WRTL</i> then found an unconstitutional application of § 441b where the speech was not \"express advocacy or its functional equivalent.\" 551 U.S., at 481, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). As explained by THE CHIEF JUSTICE's controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> the functional-equivalent test is objective: \"a court should find that [a communication] is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 469-470, 127 S.Ct. 2652.</p>\r\n<p>Under this test, <i>Hillary</i> is equivalent to express advocacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President. In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by most viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton's character and her fitness for the office of the Presidency. The narrative may contain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is unfit for the Presidency. The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration, Senator Clinton's qualifications and fitness for office, and policies the commentators predict she would pursue if elected President. It calls Senator Clinton \"Machiavellian,\" App. 64a, and asks whether she is \"the most qualified to hit the ground running if elected President,\" <i>id.,</i> at 88a. The narrator reminds viewers that \"Americans have never been keen on dynasties\" and that \"a vote for Hillary is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the White House,\" <i>id.,</i> at 143a-144a.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that <i>Hillary</i> is just \"a documentary film that examines certain historical events.\" Brief for Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie's consistent emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton's candidacy for President. The narrator begins by asking \"could [Senator Clinton] become the first female President in the history of the United States?\" App. 35a. And the narrator reiterates the movie's message in his closing line: \"Finally, before America decides on our next president, voters should need no reminders of ... what's at stakethe well being and prosperity of our nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 144a-145a.</p>\r\n<p>As the District Court found, there is no reasonable interpretation of <i>Hillary</i> other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in <i>McConnell</i> and further elaborated in <i>WRTL,</i> the film qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United further contends that § 441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads. Cf. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619. On what we might call conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by contrast, the viewer selects a program after taking \"a series of affirmative steps\": subscribing to cable; navigating through various menus; and selecting the program. See <i>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 867, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997).</p>\r\n<p>While some means of communication may be less effective than others at influencing the public in different contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of communications are to be preferred for the particular type of message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts' own lawful authority. Substantial questions would arise if courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid flux. See <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 639, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994).</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First Amendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable. First Amendment standards, however, \"must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (citing <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 269-270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>D</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to § 441b's expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political speech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an alternative to reconsidering <i>Austin,</i> the Government also seems to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, however, would be unavailing.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>MCFL,</i> the Court found unconstitutional § 441b's restrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to nonprofit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose of promoting political ideas, did not engage in business activities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit corporations or labor unions. 479 U.S., at 263-264, 107 S.Ct. 616; see also 11 CFR § 114.10. BCRA's so-called Wellstone Amendment applied § 441b's expenditure ban to all nonprofit corporations. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(c)(6); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 209, 124 S.Ct. 619. <i>McConnell</i> then interpreted the Wellstone Amendment to retain the <i>MCFL</i> exemption to § 441b's expenditure prohibition. 540 U.S., at 211, 124 S.Ct. 619. Citizens United does not qualify for the <i>MCFL</i> exemption, however, since some funds used to make the movie were donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>The Government suggests we could find BCRA's Wellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the statute, and hold that Citizens United's speech is exempt from § 441b's ban under BCRA's Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, § 441b(c)(2). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a backup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone Amendment is invalidated. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 339, 124 S.Ct. 619 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would exempt from § 441b's expenditure ban the political speech of certain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded \"exclusively\" by individual donors and the funds were maintained in a segregated account. § 441b(c)(2). Citizens United would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemption, under its terms as written, because <i>Hillary</i> was funded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argument, the Court would be required to revise the text of <i>MCFL,</i> sever BCRA's Wellstone Amendment, § 441b(c)(6), and ignore the plain text of BCRA's Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, § 441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a <i>de minimis</i> exception to <i>MCFL</i> or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corporate general treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that support candidates. There is no principled basis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> for doing this without rewriting <i>Austin</i>'s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech.</p>\r\n<p>Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view of the language of the statute. In addition to those difficulties the Government's suggestion is troubling for still another reason. The Government does not say that it agrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 3, n. 1 (\"Some courts\" have implied a <i>de minimis</i> exception, and \"appellant would appear to be covered by these decisions\"). Presumably it would find textual difficulties in this approach too. The Government, like any party, can make arguments in the alternative; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative proposal instead of merely suggesting it. This is especially true in the context of the First Amendment. As the Government stated, this case \"would require a remand\" to apply a <i>de minimis</i> standard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9, 2009). Applying this standard would thus require case-by-case determinations. But archetypical political speech would be chilled in the meantime. \"`First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.' \" <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 468-469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106514\"><a href=\"/opinion/106514/naacp-v-button/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963)). We decline to adopt an interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case determinations to verify whether political speech is banned, especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>E</h2>\r\n<p>As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment. See <i>Morse v. Frederick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145707\"><a href=\"/opinion/145707/morse-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 403, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications. Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consideration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p>Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its complaint, which raised a facial challenge to § 441b, even though count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App. 23a (count 3: \"As applied to <i>Hillary,</i> [§ 441b] is unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free expression and association\"). The Government argues that Citizens United waived its challenge to <i>Austin</i> by dismissing count 5. We disagree.</p>\r\n<p>First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that would not prevent the Court from reconsidering <i>Austin</i> or addressing the facial validity of § 441b in this case. \"Our practice `permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has been passed upon. . . .'\" <i>Lebron,</i> 513 U.S., at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112730\"><a href=\"/opinion/112730/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 118 L.Ed.2d 352 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the District Court addressed Citizens United's facial challenge. See 530 F.Supp.2d, at 278 (\"Citizens wants us to enjoin the operation of BCRA § 203 as a facially unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment right to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*893</span> freedom of speech\"). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it \"would have to overrule <i>McConnell</i>\" for Citizens United to prevail on its facial challenge and that \"[o]nly the Supreme Court may overrule its decisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112261\"><a href=\"/opinion/112261/rodriguez-de-quijas-v-shearsonamerican-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in <i>Austin</i> or <i>McConnell.</i> Even so, the District Court did \"`pas[s] upon'\" the issue. <i>Lebron, supra,</i> at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961. Furthermore, the District Court's later opinion, which granted the FEC summary judgment, was \"[b]ased on the reasoning of [its] prior opinion,\" which included the discussion of the facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F.Supp.2d 274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to <i>Austin</i> in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (\"<i>Austin</i> was wrongly decided and should be overruled\"); <i>id.,</i> at 30-32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider Citizens United's challenge to <i>Austin</i> and the facial validity of § 441b's expenditure ban.</p>\r\n<p>Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech. All concede that this claim is properly before us. And \"`[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.'\" <i>Lebron, supra,</i> at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>Yee v. Escondido,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112719\"><a href=\"/opinion/112719/yee-v-escondido/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992); alteration in original). Citizens United's argument that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled is \"not a new claim.\" <i>Lebron,</i> 513 U.S., at 379, 115 S.Ct. 961. Rather, it isat most\"a new argument to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge. The distinction is both instructive and necessary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint. See <i>United States v. Treasury Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117898\"><a href=\"/opinion/117898/united-states-v-national-treasury-employees-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 477-478, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (1995) (contrasting \"a facial challenge\" with \"a narrower remedy\"). The parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved its First Amendment challenge to § 441b as applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we cannot easily address that issue without assuming a premisethe permissibility of restricting corporate political speechthat is itself in doubt. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\"[O]nce a case is brought, no general categorical line bars a court from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly `as-applied' cases\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1327-1328. As our request for supplemental briefing implied, Citizens United's claim implicates the validity of <i>Austin,</i> which in turn implicates the facial validity of § 441b.</p>\r\n<p>When the statute now at issue came before the Court in <i>McConnell,</i> both the majority and the dissenting opinions considered the question of its facial validity. The holding and validity of <i>Austin</i> were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*894</span> essential to the reasoning of the <i>McConnell</i> majority opinion, which upheld BCRA's extension of § 441b. See 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391). <i>McConnell</i> permitted federal felony punishment for speech by all corporations, including nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elections. See 540 U.S., at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619. Four Members of the <i>McConnell</i> Court would have overruled <i>Austin,</i> including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined the Court's opinion in <i>Austin</i> but reconsidered that conclusion. See 540 U.S., at 256-262, 124 S.Ct. 619 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 273-275, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 322-338, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia, J.). That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was facilitated by the extensive record, which was \"over 100,000 pages\" long, made in the three-judge District Court. <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 176, 209 (D.D.C.2003) <i>(per curiam) (McConnell I)</i><i>.</i> It is not the case, then, that the Court today is premature in interpreting § 441b \"`on the basis of [a] factually barebones recor[d].'\" <i>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145824\"><a href=\"/opinion/145824/wash-state-grange-v-wash-state-rep-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (quoting <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134745\"><a href=\"/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 609, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004)).</p>\r\n<p>The <i>McConnell</i> majority considered whether the statute was facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought in <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145686\"><a href=\"/opinion/145686/wisconsin-right-to-life-inc-v-federal-election-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 411-412, 126 S.Ct. 1016, 163 L.Ed.2d 990 (2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and the Court confirmed that the challenge could be maintained. Then, in <i>WRTL,</i> the controlling opinion of the Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but also sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would continue to maintain the position that the record in <i>McConnell</i> demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its face. 551 U.S., at 485-504, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> which refrained from holding the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the essential elements of the Court's opinion in <i>McConnell,</i> while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made by the <i>WRTL</i> parties. 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>As noted above, Citizens United's narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for the Court to consider the facial validity of § 441b. Any other course of decision would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by § 441b's prohibitions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the facial validity of § 441b is further supported by the following reasons.</p>\r\n<p>First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position of the Government. As discussed above, see Part II-D, <i>supra,</i> the Government suggests, as an alternative argument, that an as-applied challenge might have merit. This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit corporation involved here may have received only <i>de minimis</i> donations from for-profit corporations and that some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the operation of the statute. The Government also suggests that an as-applied challenge to § 441b's ban on books may be successful, although it would defend § 441b's ban as applied to almost every other form of media <span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> including pamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65-66 (Sept. 9, 2009). The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to the uncertainty that § 441b causes. When the Government holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.</p>\r\n<p>Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity to the application of the statutory provision on these points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by some improper interpretation. See Part II-C, <i>supra.</i> It is well known that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks immediately before they are held. There are short timeframes in which speech can have influence. The need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The decision to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A speaker's ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 462, 126 S.Ct. 1016 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (citing <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <i>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97365\"><a href=\"/opinion/97365/so-pac-terminal-co-v-int-comm-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911)). Here, Citizens United decided to litigate its case to the end. Today, Citizens United finally learns, two years after the fact, whether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential primarylong after the opportunity to persuade primary voters has passed.</p>\r\n<p>Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the integrity of the election process. As additional rules are created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably within their reach is chilled. See Part II-A, <i>supra.</i> Campaign finance regulations now impose \"unique and complex rules\" on \"71 distinct entities.\" Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11-12. These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different types of political speech. <i>Id.,</i> at 14-15, n. 10. The FEC has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanations and justifications for those regulations, and 1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See <i>id.,</i> at 6, n. 7. In fact, after this Court in <i>WRTL</i> adopted an objective \"appeal to vote\" test for determining whether a communication was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement <i>WRTL</i>'s ruling. See 11 CFR § 114.15; Brief for Wyoming Liberty Group et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-27 (filed Jan. 15, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf. <i>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101773\"><a href=\"/opinion/101773/near-v-minnesota-ex-rel-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 712-713, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the regulations and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2 U.S.C. § 437f; 11 CFR § 112.1. These onerous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> restrictions thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.

When the FEC issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, \"[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speechharming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.\" <i>Virginia v.

Consequently, \"the censor's determination may in practice be final.\" <i>Freedman, supra,</i> at 58, 85 S.Ct. 734.</p>\r\n<p>This is precisely what <i>WRTL</i> sought to avoid. <i>WRTL</i> said that First Amendment standards \"must eschew `the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,' which `invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.'\" 551 U.S., at 469, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v.

Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question. Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of speech.</p>\r\n<p>The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.

For these reasons we find it necessary to reconsider <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>III</h2>\r\n<p>The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\" Laws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process. The following are just a few examples of restrictions that have been attempted at different stages of the speech processall laws found to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the outset, <i>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N.Y., Inc. v.

Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107965\"><a href=\"/opinion/107965/brandenburg-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\r\n<p>The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporationsincluding nonprofit advocacy corporationseither to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under § 441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate's defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.</p>\r\n<p>Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 330-333, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from § 441b's expenditure ban, § 441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak. Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speakand it does notthe option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with § 441b. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within 10 days. See <i>id.,</i> at 330-332, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 253-254, 107 S.Ct. 616).</p>\r\n<p>And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is about to occur:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"`These reports must contain information regarding the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of receipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identification of each political committee and candidate's authorized or affiliated committee making contributions, and any persons making loans, providing rebates, refunds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to operating expenditures in an aggregate amount over $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggregating over $200 have been made; persons to whom loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total sum of all contributions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obligations, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.'\" 540 U.S., at 331-332, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 253-254, 107 S.Ct. 616).</blockquote>\r\n<p>PACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs. See Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity 1990-2006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/ 20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income: 2006, Corporation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinafter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns). PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Section 441b's prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \"restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,\" that statute \"necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Were the Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 251, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (Government could repress speech by \"attacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas,\" for \"effective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others\"). If § 441b applied to individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.</p>\r\n<p>Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 14-15, 96 S.Ct. 612 (\"In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential\"). The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment \"`has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\" <i>Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting <i>Monitor Patriot Co. v.

Laws that burden political speech are \"subject to strict scrutiny,\" which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \"furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 464, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a categorical matter, see <i>Simon &amp; Schuster,</i> 502 U.S., at 124, 112 S.Ct. 501 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment), the quoted language from <i>WRTL</i> provides a sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case. We shall employ it here.</p>\r\n<p>Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118369\"><a href=\"/opinion/118369/united-states-v-playboy-entertainment-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (striking down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too, are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others. See <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> <i>Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 784, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated: Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content.</p>\r\n<p>Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.</p>\r\n<p>The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but these rulings were based on an interest in allowing governmental entities to perform their functions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111754\"><a href=\"/opinion/111754/bethel-school-dist-no-403-v-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 683, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986) (protecting the \"function of public school education\"); <i>Jones v.

The corporate independent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are inapposite. These precedents stand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech. By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes. At least before <i>Austin,</i> the Court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.</p>\r\n<p>We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>1</h2>\r\n<p>The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 778, n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (citing <i>Linmark Associates, Inc. v.

The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not \"natural persons.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 776, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see <i>id.,</i> at 780, n. 16, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 828, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\r\n<p>At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws of some States and of the United States imposed a ban on corporate direct contributions to candidates. See B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 23 (2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress first prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and labor unions in § 304 of the Labor Management Relations Act 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U.S.C. § 251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)). In passing this Act Congress overrode the veto of President Truman, who warned that the expenditure ban was a \"dangerous intrusion on free speech.\" Message from the President of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 334, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).</p>\r\n<p>For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and union expenditures are constitutional. See <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 502, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in the background of <i>United States v. CIO,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104588\"><a href=\"/opinion/104588/united-states-v-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional candidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that \"the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the federal expenditure prohibition's] constitutionality\" if it were construed to suppress that writing. <i>Id.,</i> at 121, 68 S.Ct. 1349. The Court engaged in statutory interpretation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*901</span> and found the statute did not cover the publication. <i>Id.,</i> at 121-122, and n. 20, 68 S.Ct. 1349. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Management Relations Act's expenditure ban. <i>Id.,</i> at 155, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ., concurring in result). The concurrence explained that any \"`undue influence' \" generated by a speaker's \"large expenditures\" was outweighed \"by the loss for democratic processes resulting from the restrictions upon free and full public discussion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 143, 68 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105465\"><a href=\"/opinion/105465/united-states-v-automobile-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957), the Court again encountered the independent expenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U.S.C. § 610 (1952 ed.). See 62 Stat. 723-724. After holding only that a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates was covered by the statute, the Court \"[r]efus[ed] to anticipate constitutional questions\" and remanded for the trial to proceed. 352 U.S., at 591, 77 S.Ct. 529. Three Justices dissented, arguing that the Court should have reached the constitutional question and that the ban on independent expenditures was unconstitutional:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Under our Constitution it is We The People who are sovereign. The people have the final say. The legislators are their spokesmen. The people determine through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is therefore importantvitally importantthat all channels of communications be open to them during every election, that no point of view be restrained or barred, and that the people have access to the views of every group in the community.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 593, 77 S.Ct. 529 (opinion of Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C.J., and Black, J.).</blockquote>\r\n<p>The dissent concluded that deeming a particular group \"too powerful\" was not a \"justificatio[n] for withholding First Amendment rights from any grouplabor or corporate.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 597, 77 S.Ct. 529. The Court did not get another opportunity to consider the constitutional question in that case; for after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty. See Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421, 463 (2008).</p>\r\n<p>Later, in <i>Pipefitters v.

The Court would not resolve that question for another four years.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2</h2>\r\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, the Court addressed various challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created 18 U.S.C. § 608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265, an independent expenditure ban separate from § 610 that applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions, <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 23, 39, and n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>Before addressing the constitutionality of § 608(e)'s independent expenditure ban, <i>Buckley</i> first upheld § 608(b), FECA's limits on direct contributions to candidates. The <i>Buckley</i> Court recognized a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest in \"the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>id.,</i> at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612. This followed from the Court's concern that large contributions could be given \"to secure a political <i>quid pro quo.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>The <i>Buckley</i> Court explained that the potential for <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption distinguished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*902</span> direct contributions to candidates from independent expenditures. The Court emphasized that \"the independent expenditure ceiling . . . fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\" <i>id.,</i> at 47-48, 96 S.Ct. 612, because \"[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate,\" <i>id.,</i> at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Buckley</i> invalidated § 608(e)'s restrictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice dissenting. See <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-pol/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 491, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455, n. 3 (1985) <i>(NCPAC).</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Buckley</i> did not consider § 610's separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition that had also been in the background in <i>CIO, Automobile Workers,</i> and <i>Pipefitters.</i> Had § 610 been challenged in the wake of <i>Buckley,</i> however, it could not have been squared with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See <i>WRTL, supra,</i> at 487, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\"<i>Buckley</i> might well have been the last word on limitations on independent expenditures\"); <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 683, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The expenditure ban invalidated in <i>Buckley,</i> § 608(e), applied to corporations and unions, 424 U.S., at 23, 39, n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612; and some of the prevailing plaintiffs in <i>Buckley</i> were corporations, <i>id.,</i> at 8., 96 S.Ct. 612 The <i>Buckley</i> Court did not invoke the First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine, see <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), to suggest that § 608(e)'s expenditure ban would have been constitutional if it had applied only to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U.S., at 50, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Buckley</i> cited with approval the <i>Automobile Workers</i> dissent, which argued that § 610 was unconstitutional. 424 U.S., at 43, 96 S.Ct. 612 (citing 352 U.S., at 595-596, 77 S.Ct. 529 (opinion of Douglas, J.)).</p>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified § 610's corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U.S.C. § 441b four months after <i>Buckley</i> was decided. See 90 Stat. 490. Section 441b is the independent expenditure restriction challenged here.</p>\r\n<p>Less than two years after <i>Buckley, </i><i>Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. <i>Bellotti</i> could not have been clearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on corporate independent expenditures related to referenda issues:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"We thus find no support in the First. . . Amendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposition that speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its business or property.. . . [That proposition] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may represent in public debate over controversial issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the subject to justify communication.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>* * * * * *</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 784-785, 98 S.Ct. 1407.</blockquote>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*903</span> It is important to note that the reasoning and holding of <i>Bellotti</i> did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint-discriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from speaking.</p>\r\n<p><i>Bellotti</i> did not address the constitutionality of the State's ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under <i>Bellotti</i>'s central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker's corporate identity. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3</h2>\r\n<p>Thus the law stood until <i>Austin. Austin</i> \"uph[eld] a direct restriction on the independent expenditure of funds for political speech for the first time in [this Court's] history.\" 494 U.S., at 695, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). There, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general treasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a specific candidate. Michigan law, however, prohibited corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state office. A violation of the law was punishable as a felony. The Court sustained the speech prohibition.</p>\r\n<p>To bypass <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti,</i> the <i>Austin</i> Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion interest. <i>Austin</i> found a compelling governmental interest in preventing \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391; see <i>id.,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (citing <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-<i>Austin</i> line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity and a post-<i>Austin</i> line that permits them. No case before <i>Austin</i> had held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures for political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. Before <i>Austin</i> Congress had enacted legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the same proposition before this Court. See <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (FEC posited that Congress intended to \"curb the political influence of `those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital'\" (quoting <i>Automobile Workers, supra,</i> at 585, 77 S.Ct. 529)); <i>California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 201, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) (Congress believed that \"differing structures and purposes\" of corporations and unions \"may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process\"). In neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.</p>\r\n<p>In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in § 441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on which <i>Austin</i> and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two other compelling interests support <i>Austin</i>'s holding that corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption interest, see 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see <i>id.,</i> at 674-675, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the three points in turn.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*904</span> 1</h2>\r\n<p>As for <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-48 (Sept. 9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot support § 441b.</p>\r\n<p>If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form. The Government contends that <i>Austin</i> permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communication stemming from a corporation. See Part II-E, <i>supra;</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also <i>id.,</i> at 26-31 (Mar. 24, 2009). If <i>Austin</i> were correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books. The Government responds \"that the FEC has never applied this statute to a book,\" and if it did, \"there would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009). This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.</p>\r\n<p>Political speech is \"indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (footnote omitted); see <i>ibid.</i> (the worth of speech \"does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\"); <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612 (\"[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment\"); <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 597, 77 S.Ct. 529 (Douglas, J., dissenting); <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 154-155, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result). This protection for speech is inconsistent with <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale. <i>Austin</i> sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corporations from obtaining \"`an unfair advantage in the political marketplace'\" by using \"`resources amassed in the economic marketplace.' \" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616). But <i>Buckley</i> rejected the premise that the Government has an interest \"in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 791, n. 30, 98 S.Ct. 1407. <i>Buckley</i> was specific in stating that \"the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns\" could not sustain the governmental prohibition. 424 U.S., at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612. The First Amendment's protections do not depend on the speaker's \"financial ability to engage in public discussion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invalidated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds. See <i>Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2774, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (\"Leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, § 2, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*905</span> the voters' choices\"). The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker's wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker's identity.</p>\r\n<p>Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a further argument, the <i>Austin</i> majority undertook to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that \"[s]tate law grants corporations special advantagessuch as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391. This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech. \"It is rudimentary that the State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 680, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\r\n<p>It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that corporate funds may \"have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (majority opinion). All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech. The First Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker's ideas. See <i>id.,</i> at 707, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\"Many persons can trace their funds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then in the form of dividends, interest, or salary\").</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media corporations. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 283, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (\"The chilling endpoint of the Court's reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press\"). Cf. <i>Tornillo,</i> 418 U.S., at 250, 94 S.Ct. 2831 (alleging the existence of \"vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires\"). Media corporations are now exempt from § 441b's ban on corporate expenditures. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i). Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the largest media corporations have \"immense aggregations of wealth,\" and the views expressed by media corporations often \"have little or no correlation to the public's support\" for those views. <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Thus, under the Government's reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities. There is no precedent for permitting this under the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law now under consideration. There is no precedent supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media corporations and those which are not. \"We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct. 1407); see <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111490\"><a href=\"/opinion/111490/dun-bradstreet-inc-v-greenmoss-builders-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 784, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and STEVENS, JJ., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 773, 105 S.Ct. 2939 (White, J., concurring in judgment). With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*906</span> comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.</p>\r\n<p>The law's exception for media corporations is, on its own terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidistortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further, separate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, even though both have the need or the motive to communicate their views. The exemption applies to media corporations owned or controlled by corporations that have diverse and substantial investments and participate in endeavors other than news. So even assuming the most doubtful proposition that a news organization has a right to speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a conglomerate that owns both a media business and an unrelated business to influence or control the media in order to advance its overall business interest. At the same time, some other corporation, with an identical business interest but no media outlet in its ownership structure, would be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the same issue. This differential treatment cannot be squared with the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>There is simply no support for the view that the First Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the suppression of political speech by media corporations. The Framers may not have anticipated modern business and media corporations. See <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117921\"><a href=\"/opinion/117921/mcintyre-v-ohio-elections-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span>, 360-361, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Yet television networks and major newspapers owned by media corporations have become the most important means of mass communication in modern times. The First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society's most salient media. It was understood as a response to the repression of speech and the press that had existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press that were imposed in the colonies. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 252-253, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); <i>Grosjean,</i> 297 U.S., at 245-248, 56 S.Ct. 444; <i>Near,</i> 283 U.S., at 713-714, 51 S.Ct. 625. The great debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists over our founding document were published and expressed in the most important means of mass communication of that eranewspapers owned by individuals. See <i>McIntyre,</i> 514 U.S., at 341-343, 115 S.Ct. 1511; <i>id.,</i> at 367, 115 S.Ct. 1511 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). At the founding, speech was open, comprehensive, and vital to society's definition of itself; there were no limits on the sources of speech and knowledge. See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 5 (1967) (\"Any number of people could join in such proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from all sides\"); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787, p. 6 (1969) (\"[I]t is not surprising that the intellectual sources of [the Americans'] Revolutionary thought were profuse and various\"). The Framers may have been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of communication, but that does not mean that those speakers and media are entitled to less First Amendment protection than those types of speakers and media that provided the means of communicating political ideas when the Bill of Rights was adopted.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> interferes with the \"open marketplace\" of ideas protected by the First Amendment. <i>New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145835\"><a href=\"/opinion/145835/new-york-state-bd-of-elections-v-lopez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 208, 128 S.Ct. 791, 169 L.Ed.2d 665 (2008); see <i>ibid.</i> (ideas \"may compete\" in this marketplace \"without government interference\"); <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 274, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). It permits the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*907</span> Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens. See Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns). Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth. See Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million businesses that belong to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have fewer than 100 employees); M. Keightley, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Business Organizational Choices: Taxation and Responses to Legislative Changes 10 (2009) (more than 75% of corporations whose income is taxed under federal law, see 26 U.S.C. § 301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year). This fact belies the Government's argument that the statute is justified on the ground that it prevents the \"distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.</p>\r\n<p>The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The Government has \"muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 257-258, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). And \"the electorate [has been] deprived of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function.\" <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 144, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result). By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit, the Government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the remedy of \"destroying the liberty\" of some factions is \"worse than the disease.\" The Federalist No. 10, p. 130 (B. Wright ed.1961) (J. Madison). Factions should be checked by permitting them all to speak, see <i>ibid.,</i> and by entrusting the people to judge what is true and what is false.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, from presenting both facts and opinions to the public. This makes <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale all the more an aberration. \"[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and administrative bodies.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (citing <i>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108431\"><a href=\"/opinion/108431/california-motor-transport-co-v-trucking-unlimited/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 510-511, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972); <i>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

Corporate executives and employees counsel Members of Congress and Presidential administrations on many issues, as a matter of routine and often in private. An <i>amici</i> brief filed on behalf of Montana and 25 other States notes that lobbying and corporate communications with elected officials occur on a regular basis. Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 19. When that phenomenon is coupled with § 441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit corporations cannot raise a voice to object when other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are cooperating with the Government. That cooperation may sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a Government official who uses his or her authority, influence, and power to threaten corporations to support the Government's policies. Those kinds of interactions are often unknown and unseen. The speech that § 441b forbids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and purpose. References to massive corporate treasuries should not mask the real operation of this law. Rhetoric ought not obscure reality.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*908</span> Even if § 441b's expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. See, <i>e.g., WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 503-504, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\"In the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142 million to [26 U.S.C. § 527 organizations]\"). Yet certain disfavored associations of citizensthose that have taken on the corporate formare penalized for engaging in the same political speech.</p>\r\n<p>When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2</h2>\r\n<p>What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court found this interest \"sufficiently important\" to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U.S., at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612. When <i>Buckley</i> examined an expenditure ban, it found \"that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to large direct contributions, <i>Buckley</i> reasoned that they could be given \"to secure a political <i>quid pro quo,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 26, 96 S.Ct. 612, and that \"the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained,\" <i>id.,</i> at 27, 96 S.Ct. 612. The practices <i>Buckley</i> noted would be covered by bribery laws, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 201, if a <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement were proved. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 27, and n. 28, 96 S.Ct. 612 (citing <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328884\"><a href=\"/opinion/328884/james-l-buckley-united-states-senator-from-the-sta/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 839-840, and nn. 36-38 (CADC 1975) (en banc) <i>(per curiam)</i>). The Court, in consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 260, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 210, 103 S.Ct. 552, 74 L.Ed.2d 364 (1982) <i>(NRWC).</i> The <i>Buckley</i> Court, nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of corruption. That case did not extend this rationale to independent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.</p>\r\n<p>\"The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612; see <i>ibid.</i> (independent expenditures have a \"substantially diminished potential for abuse\"). Limits on independent expenditures, such as § 441b, have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government's interest in preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expenditures <span class=\"star-pagination\">*909</span> by for-profit corporations. The Government does not claim that these expenditures have corrupted the political process in those States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-9, n. 5.</p>\r\n<p>A single footnote in <i>Bellotti</i> purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be shown to cause corruption. 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. For the reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. Dicta in <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote suggested that \"a corporation's right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Citing the portion of <i>Buckley</i> that invalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424 U.S., at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612, and a law review student comment, <i>Bellotti</i> surmised that \"Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. <i>Buckley,</i> however, struck down a ban on independent expenditures to support candidates that covered corporations, 424 U.S., at 23, 39, n. 45, 96 S.Ct. 612, and explained that \"the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application,\" <i>id.,</i> at 42, 96 S.Ct. 612. <i>Bellotti</i>'s dictum is thus supported only by a law review student comment, which misinterpreted <i>Buckley.</i> See Comment, The Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and Minority Rights and Remedies, 126 U. Pa. L.Rev. 386, 408 (1977) (suggesting that \"corporations and labor unions should be held to different and more stringent standards than an individual or other associations under a regulatory scheme for campaign financing\").</p>\r\n<p>Seizing on this aside in <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote, the Court in <i>NRWC</i> did say there is a \"sufficient\" governmental interest in \"ensur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth amassed\" by corporations would not \"be used to incur political debts from legislators who are aided by the contributions.\" 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552 (citing <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 579, 77 S.Ct. 529); see 459 U.S., at 210, and n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 552; <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (<i>NRWC</i> suggested a governmental interest in restricting \"the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form\"). <i>NRWC,</i> however, has little relevance here. <i>NRWC</i> decided no more than that a restriction on a corporation's ability to solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct contributions to candidates, did not violate the First Amendment. 459 U.S., at 206, 103 S.Ct. 552. <i>NRWC</i> thus involved contribution limits, see <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 495-496, 105 S.Ct. 1459, which, unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 136-138, and n. 40, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 259-260, 107 S.Ct. 616. Citizens United has not made direct contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\r\n<p>When <i>Buckley</i> identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 296-298, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*910</span> KENNEDY, J.) (citing <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 26-28, 30, 46-48, 96 S.Ct. 612); <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 497, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (\"The hallmark of corruption is the financial <i>quid pro quo:</i> dollars for political favors\"); <i>id.,</i> at 498, 105 S.Ct. 1459. The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics. It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on responsiveness.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 297, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</blockquote>\r\n<p>Reliance on a \"generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 296, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. See <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \"`to take part in democratic governance'\" because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118335\"><a href=\"/opinion/118335/nixon-v-shrink-missouri-government-pac/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 390, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000)).</p>\r\n<p><i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009), is not to the contrary. <i>Caperton</i> held that a judge was required to recuse himself \"when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge's election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2263-2264. The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant's due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. See <i>Withrow v. Larkin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109237\"><a href=\"/opinion/109237/withrow-v-larkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 46, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). <i>Caperton</i>'s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant's political speech could be banned.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>McConnell</i> record was \"over 100,000 pages\" long, <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 209, yet it \"does not have any direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures,\" <i>id.,</i> at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). This confirms <i>Buckley</i>'s reasoning that independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate. See 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption. The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called \"soft money,\" were made to gain access to elected officials. <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 125, 130-131, 146-152, 124 S.Ct. 619; see <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 471-481, 491-506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 842-843, 858-859 (opinion of Leon, J.). This case, however, is about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*911</span> independent expenditures, not soft money. When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3</h2>\r\n<p>The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted interest, like <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the political speech even of media corporations. See <i>supra,</i> at 905-906. Assume, for example, that a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper disagrees with the political views the newspaper expresses. See <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 687, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Under the Government's view, that potential disagreement could give the Government the authority to restrict the media corporation's political speech. The First Amendment does not allow that power. There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders \"through the procedures of corporate democracy.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 794, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see <i>id.,</i> at 794, n. 34, 98 S.Ct. 1407.</p>\r\n<p>Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder-protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissenting shareholder's interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with only single shareholders. As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and explore other regulatory mechanisms. The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>4</h2>\r\n<p>We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U.S.C. § 441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to \"foreign national[s]\"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. See <i>Broadrick,</i> 413 U.S., at 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>Our precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts us <span class=\"star-pagination\">*912</span> on a course that is sure error. \"Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\" <i>Montejo v. Louisiana,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2088-2089, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009) (overruling <i>Michigan v.

We have also examined whether \"experience has pointed up the precedent's shortcomings.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (overruling <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)).</p>\r\n<p>These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting <i>Austin,</i> which itself contravened this Court's earlier precedents in <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti.</i> \"This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the First Amendment.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 500, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). \"<i>[S]tare decisis</i> is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\" <i>Helvering v. Hallock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103292\"><a href=\"/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 119, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604 (1940).</p>\r\n<p>For the reasons above, it must be concluded that <i>Austin</i> was not well reasoned. The Government defends <i>Austin,</i> relying almost entirely on \"the quid pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the shareholder interest,\" and not <i>Austin</i>'s expressed antidistortion rationale. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see <i>id.,</i> at 45-46. When neither party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of adhering to that precedent through <i>stare decisis</i> is diminished. <i>Austin</i> abandoned First Amendment principles, furthermore, by relying on language in some of our precedents that traces back to the <i>Automobile Workers</i> Court's flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as <i>Amici Curiae;</i> Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts 33-35, 153-157 (1988). See <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257-258, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 500-501, 105 S.Ct. 1459); <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 585, 77 S.Ct. 529); <i>NCPAC, supra,</i> at 500, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (quoting <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, 103 S.Ct. 552); <i>id.,</i> at 208, 103 S.Ct. 552 (\"The history of the movement to regulate the political contributions and expenditures of corporations and labor unions is set forth in great detail in <i>[</i><i>Automobile Workers], supra,</i> at 570-584, 77 S.Ct. 529, and we need only summarize the development here\").</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 176-177, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"Given BCRA's tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26 U.S.C. § 527] organizations will only increase\"). Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.</p>\r\n<p>Rapid changes in technologyand the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*913</span> free expressioncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. See Part II-C, <i>supra.</i> Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. See <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 261, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, § 441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a); <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 249, 107 S.Ct. 616. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech.</p>\r\n<p>No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court stated in <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), reliance interests are important considerations in property and contract cases, where parties may have acted in conformance with existing legal rules in order to conduct transactions. Here, though, parties have been prevented from actingcorporations have been banned from making independent expenditures. Legislatures may have enacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those bans were constitutional. This is not a compelling interest for <i>stare decisis.</i> If it were, legislative acts could prevent us from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfering with our duty \"to say what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\r\n<p>Due consideration leads to this conclusion: <i>Austin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to the principle established in <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti</i> that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>D</h2>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling <i>Austin</i> \"effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section 203, but also 2 U.S.C. 441b's prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express advocacy.\" Brief for Appellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures are therefore invalid and cannot be applied to <i>Hillary.</i></p>\r\n<p>Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule the part of <i>McConnell</i> that upheld BCRA § 203's extension of § 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. See 540 U.S., at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619. The <i>McConnell</i> Court relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in <i>Austin</i> to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld in <i>Austin,</i> see 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619, and we have found this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This part of <i>McConnell</i> is now overruled.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>IV</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United next challenges BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure provisions as applied to <i>Hillary</i> and the three advertisements for the movie. Under BCRA § 311, televised electioneering communications funded by anyone other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*914</span> \"`______ is responsible for the content of this advertising.'\" 2 U.S.C. § 441d(d)(2). The required statement must be made in a \"clearly spoken manner,\" and displayed on the screen in a \"clearly readable manner\" for at least four seconds. <i>Ibid.</i> It must state that the communication \"is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee\"; it must also display the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or group that funded the advertisement. § 441d(a)(3). Under BCRA § 201, any person who spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year must file a disclosure statement with the FEC. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1). That statement must identify the person making the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the communication was directed, and the names of certain contributors. § 434(f)(2).</p>\r\n<p>Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \"impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 64, 96 S.Ct. 612, and \"do not prevent anyone from speaking,\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 201, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court has subjected these requirements to \"exacting scrutiny,\" which requires a \"substantial relation\" between the disclosure requirement and a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest. <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 64, 66, 96 S.Ct. 612 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 231-232, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in \"provid[ing] the electorate with information\" about the sources of election-related spending. 424 U.S., at 66, 96 S.Ct. 612. The <i>McConnell</i> Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA §§ 201 and 311. 540 U.S., at 196, 124 S.Ct. 619. There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements \"`while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 237). The Court therefore upheld BCRA §§ 201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens \"`make informed choices in the political marketplace.'\" 540 U.S., at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I, supra,</i> at 237); see 540 U.S., at 231, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Although both provisions were facially upheld, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a \"`reasonable probability'\" that disclosure of its contributors' names \"`will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 198, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 74, 96 S.Ct. 612).</p>\r\n<p>For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>B</h2>\r\n<p>Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 10-second ads to promote <i>Hillary.</i> Under FEC regulations, a communication that \"[p]roposes a commercial transaction\" was not subject to 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on corporate or union funding of electioneering communications. 11 CFR § 114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations, however, do not exempt those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA §§ 201 and 311. See 72 Fed.Reg. 72901 (2007).</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that the disclaimer requirements in § 311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads. It contends that the governmental interest in providing information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*915</span> any commercial advertisements, including the ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within BCRA's definition of an \"electioneering communication\": They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy. See 530 F.Supp.2d, at 276, nn. 2-4. The disclaimers required by § 311 \"provid[e] the electorate with information,\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 196, 124 S.Ct. 619, and \"insure that the voters are fully informed\" about the person or group who is speaking, <i>Buckley, supra,</i> at 76, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 792, n. 32, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (\"Identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected\"). At the very least, the disclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United argues that § 311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts that § 311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of the group's speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected these arguments in <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 230-231, 124 S.Ct. 619. And we now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclosure provisions.</p>\r\n<p>As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, the disclosure requirements in § 201 must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The principal opinion in <i>WRTL</i> limited 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on independent expenditures to express advocacy and its functional equivalent. 551 U.S., at 469-476, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). Citizens United seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA's disclosure requirements. We reject this contention.</p>\r\n<p>The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech. See, <i>e.g., MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 262, 107 S.Ct. 616. In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expenditures even though it invalidated a provision that imposed a ceiling on those expenditures. 424 U.S., at 75-76, 96 S.Ct. 612. In <i>McConnell,</i> three Justices who would have found § 441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA's disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540 U.S., at 321, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and SCALIA, J.). And the Court has upheld registration and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself. <i>United States v. Harriss,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105232\"><a href=\"/opinion/105232/united-states-v-harriss/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 625, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954) (Congress \"has merely provided for a modicum of information from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose\"). For these reasons, we reject Citizens United's contention that the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United also disputes that an informational interest justifies the application of § 201 to its ads, which only attempt to persuade viewers to see the film. Even if it disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens United says, the information would not help viewers make informed choices in the political marketplace. This is similar to the argument rejected above with respect to disclaimers. Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election. Because the informational <span class=\"star-pagination\">*916</span> interest alone is sufficient to justify application of § 201 to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government's other asserted interests.</p>\r\n<p>Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements can chill donations to an organization by exposing donors to retaliation. Some <i>amici</i> point to recent events in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for Institute for Justice as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13-16; Brief for Alliance Defense Fund as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-22. In <i>McConnell,</i> the Court recognized that § 201 would be unconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a reasonable probability that the group's members would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were disclosed. 540 U.S., at 198, 124 S.Ct. 619. The examples cited by <i>amici</i> are cause for concern. Citizens United, however, has offered no evidence that its members may face similar threats or reprisals. To the contrary, Citizens United has been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation.</p>\r\n<p>Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of corporate democracy, see <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 794, and n. 34, 98 S.Ct. 1407, can be more effective today because modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today. It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress' findings in passing BCRA were premised on a system without adequate disclosure. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 128, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"[T]he public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads\"); <i>id.,</i> at 196-197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McConnell I,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 237). With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \"`in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests.\" 540 U.S., at 259, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see <i>MCFL, supra,</i> at 261, 107 S.Ct. 616. The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>C</h2>\r\n<p>For the same reasons we uphold the application of BCRA §§ 201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their application to <i>Hillary.</i> We find no constitutional impediment to the application of BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand. And there has been no showing that, as applied in this case, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or expression.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>V</h2>\r\n<p>When word concerning the plot of the movie <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution. See Smoodin, \"Compulsory\" Viewing for Every Citizen: <i>Mr. Smith</i> and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra's Capitol Offense, N.Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under <i>Austin,</i> though, officials could have done more than discourage <span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> its distributionthey could have banned the film. After all, it, like <i>Hillary,</i> was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress. <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force.</p>\r\n<p>Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the \"purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\" in order to engage in political speech. 2 U.S.C. § 431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election. Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute's purpose and design.</p>\r\n<p>Some members of the public might consider <i>Hillary</i> to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation's course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates. Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make. \"The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\" <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 341, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\r\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U.S.C. § 441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures. The judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\r\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\r\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring.</p>\r\n<p>The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern. Its theory, if accepted, would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long as the newspapers were owned by corporationsas the major ones are. First Amendment rights could be confined to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of our democracy.</p>\r\n<p>The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer. I write separately to address the important principles of judicial restraint and <i>stare decisis</i> implicated in this case.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p>Judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \"the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> perform.\" <i>Blodgett v.

Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us. See <i>Ashwander v.

But I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how these principles apply in this case.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's step-by-step analysis accords with our standard practice of avoiding broad constitutional questions except when necessary to decide the case before us. The majority begins by addressing and quite properly rejectingCitizens United's statutory claim that 2 U.S.C. § 441b does not actually cover its production and distribution of <i>Hillary: The Movie</i> (hereinafter <i>Hillary</i>). If there were a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in Citizens United's favor (and thereby avoiding constitutional adjudication), it would be proper to do so. Indeed, that is precisely the approach the Court took just last Term in <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009), when eight Members of the Court agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds instead of reaching the appellant's broader argument that the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United's statutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group's various constitutional arguments, beginning with its narrowest claim (that <i>Hillary</i> is not the functional equivalent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest claim (that <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990) should be overruled). This is the same order of operations followed by the controlling opinion in <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (<i>WRTL</i>). There the appellant was able to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument because its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional equivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to go on to address the broader claim that <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), should be overruled. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652; <i>id.,</i> at 482-483, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (ALITO, J., concurring). This case is differentnot, as the dissent suggests, because the approach taken in <i>WRTL</i> has been deemed a \"failure,\" <i>post,</i> at 935, but because, in the absence of any valid narrower ground of decision, there is no way to avoid Citizens United's broader constitutional argument.</p>\r\n<p>The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citizens United's claims that I find quite perplexing. It presumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United's narrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack meritotherwise its conclusion that the group should lose this case would make no sense. Despite agreeing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*919</span> that these narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent argues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question of whether <i>Austin</i> remains good law. It even suggests that the Court's failure to adopt one of these concededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority is not \"serious about judicial restraint.\" <i>Post,</i> at 938.</p>\r\n<p>This approach is based on a false premise: that our practice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily broad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obligation faithfully to interpret the law. It should go without saying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right. Thus while it is true that \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\" <i>post,</i> at 937 (internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it <i>is</i> necessary to decide more. There is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication. When constitutional questions are \"indispensably necessary\" to resolving the case at hand, \"the court must meet and decide them.\" <i>Ex parte Randolph,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span>, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United's broader argument that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled, the debate over whether to consider this claim on an asapplied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the point. Citizens United has standingit is being injured by the Government's enforcement of the Act. Citizens United has a constitutional claimthe Act violates the First Amendment, because it prohibits political speech. The Government has a defensethe Act may be enforced, consistent with the First Amendment, against corporations. Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the question before us.</p>\r\n<p>Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no difference of any substance whether this case is resolved by invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to Citizens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rightswould mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win. Likewise, a conclusion that the Act may be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause it is constitutional to prohibit corporate political speechwould similarly govern future cases. Regardless whether we label Citizens United's claim a \"facial\" or \"as-applied\" challenge, the consequences of the Court's decision are the same.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in the same direction: Congress may not prohibit political speech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union. What makes this case difficult is the need to confront our prior decision in <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p>This is the first case in which we have been asked to overrule <i>Austin,</i> and thus it is also the first in which we have had reason to consider how much weight to give <i>stare decisis</i> in assessing its continued validity. The dissent erroneously declares <span class=\"star-pagination\">*920</span> that the Court \"reaffirmed\" <i>Austin</i>'s holding in subsequent casesnamely, <i>Federal Election Comm'n v.

Post,</i> at 956-957. Not so. Not a single party in any of those cases asked us to overrule <i>Austin,</i> and as the dissent points out, <i>post,</i> at 931-932, the Court generally does not consider constitutional arguments that have not properly been raised. <i>Austin</i>'s validity was therefore not directly at issue in the cases the dissent cites. The Court's unwillingness to overturn <i>Austin</i> in those cases cannot be understood as a <i>reaffirmation</i> of that decision.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>A</h2>\r\n<p>Fidelity to precedentthe policy of <i>stare decisis</i>is vital to the proper exercise of the judicial function. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\" <i>Payne v.

Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional idealthe rule of law. It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration itself departed from the Court's jurisprudence, returning to the \"`intrinsically sounder' doctrine established in prior cases\" may \"better serv[e] the values of <i>stare decisis</i> than would following [the] more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 231, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995); see also <i>Helvering, supra,</i> at 119, 60 S.Ct. 444; <i>Randall, supra,</i> at 274, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Abrogating the errant precedent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better preserve the law's coherence and curtail the precedent's disruptive effects.</p>\r\n<p>Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes the stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its <i>stare decisis</i> effect is also diminished. This can happen in a number of circumstances, such as when the precedent's validity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for decision in future cases, when its rationale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in related areas of law, and when the precedent's underlying reasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot keep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and different justifications to shore up the original mistake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 817, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009); <i>Montejo v.

Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). <i>Austin</i> undermined the careful line that <i>Buckley</i> drew to distinguish limits on contributions to candidates from limits on independent expenditures on speech. <i>Buckley</i> rejected the asserted government interest in regulating independent expenditures, concluding that \"restrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Bellotti, supra,</i> at 790-791, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110588\"><a href=\"/opinion/110588/citizens-against-rent-controlcoalition-for-fair-ho/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 295, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). <i>Austin,</i> however, allowed the Government to prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\" in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. <i>Austin</i>'s reasoning wasand remainsinconsistent with <i>Buckley</i>'s explicit repudiation of any government interest in \"equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> was also inconsistent with <i>Bellotti</i>'s clear rejection of the idea that \"speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> protection simply because its source is a corporation.\" 435 U.S., at 784, 98 S.Ct. 1407. The dissent correctly points out that <i>Bellotti</i> involved a referendum rather than a candidate election, and that <i>Bellotti</i> itself noted this factual distinction, <i>id.,</i> at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407; <i>post,</i> at 958. But this distinction does not explain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on speech in candidate elections when individuals may not.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the validity of <i>Austin</i>'s rationaleitself adopted over two \"spirited dissents,\" <i>Payne,</i> 501 U.S., at 829, 111 S.Ct. 2597has proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Members of this Court ever since. See, <i>e.g., WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 483, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 247, 264, 286, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinions of SCALIA, THOMAS, and KENNEDY, JJ.); <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163, 164, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (opinions of KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.). The simple fact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of course, insufficient to justify overruling it. But it does undermine the precedent's ability to contribute to the stable and orderly development of the law. In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Courtwhich in this case is squarely asked to reconsider <i>Austin</i>'s validity for the first timeto address the matter with a greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.</p>\r\n<p>Third, the <i>Austin</i> decision is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court's decisions even outside the particular context of corporate express advocacy. The First Amendment theory underlying <i>Austin</i>'s holding is extraordinarily broad. <i>Austin</i>'s logic would authorize government prohibition of political speech by a category of speakers in the name of equalitya point that most scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that the dissent denies. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall's Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L.J. 655, 669 (2009) (<i>Austin</i> \"has been understood by most commentators to be an opinion driven by equality considerations, albeit disguised in the language of `political corruption'\") with <i>post,</i> at 970 (<i>Austin</i>'s rationale \"is manifestly not just an `equalizing' ideal in disguise\").<sup>[2]</sup></p>\r\n<p>It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the Court have relied on <i>Austin</i>'s expansive logic to justify greater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside the original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of candidates running for office. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2780, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (relying on <i>Austin</i> and other cases to justify restrictions on campaign spending by individual candidates, explaining that \"there is no reason that their logicspecifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political processis not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> equally applicable in the context of individual wealth\"); <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 203-209, 124 S.Ct. 619 (extending <i>Austin</i> beyond its original context to cover not only the \"functional equivalent\" of express advocacy by corporations, but also electioneering speech conducted by labor unions). The dissent in this case succumbs to the same temptation, suggesting that <i>Austin</i> justifies prohibiting corporate speech because such speech might unduly influence \"the market for legislation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 975. The dissent reads <i>Austin</i> to permit restrictions on corporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that the corporate form may help individuals coordinate and present their views more effectively. <i>Post,</i> at 975. A speaker's ability to persuade, however, provides no basis for government regulation of free and open public debate on what the laws should be.</p>\r\n<p>If taken seriously, <i>Austin</i>'s logic would apply most directly to newspapers and other media corporations. They have a more profound impact on public discourse than most other speakers. These corporate entities are, for the time being, not subject to § 441b's otherwise generally applicable prohibitions on corporate political speech. But this is simply a matter of legislative grace. The fact that the law currently grants a favored position to media corporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in accepting a theory that would allow government restrictions on their political speech. See generally <i>McConnell, supra,</i> at 283-286, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).</p>\r\n<p>These readings of <i>Austin</i> do no more than carry that decision's reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so, they highlight the threat <i>Austin</i> poses to First Amendment rights generally, even outside its specific factual context of corporate express advocacy. Because <i>Austin</i> is so difficult to confine to its factsand because its logic threatens to undermine our First Amendment jurisprudence and the nature of public discourse more broadlythe costs of giving it <i>stare decisis</i> effect are unusually high.</p>\r\n<p>Finally and most importantly, the Government's own effort to defend <i>Austin</i> or, more accurately, to defend something that is not quite <i>Austin</i>underscores its weakness as a precedent of the Court. The Government concedes that <i>Austin</i> \"is not the most lucid opinion,\" yet asks us to reaffirm its holding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9, 2009). But while invoking <i>stare decisis</i> to support this position, the Government never once even <i>mentions</i> the compelling interest that <i>Austin</i> relied upon in the first place: the need to diminish \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of endorsing <i>Austin</i> on its own terms, the Government urges us to reaffirm <i>Austin</i>'s specific holding on the basis of two new and potentially expansive intereststhe need to prevent actual or apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, and the need to protect corporate shareholders. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 8-10, 12-13. Those interests may or may not support the <i>result</i> in <i>Austin,</i> but they were plainly not part of the <i>reasoning</i> on which <i>Austin</i> relied.</p>\r\n<p>To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that <i>Austin</i> did not embrace either of the new rationales it now urges upon us. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (\"The Court did not decide in <i>Austin</i>... whether the compelling interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption provides a constitutionally sufficient justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> for prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds for independent electioneering\"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (\"<i>Austin</i> did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest compelling interest\"); <i>id.,</i> at 61 (\"[The Court:] I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest. This is a new argument. [The Government:] I think that that's fair\"); <i>id.,</i> at 64 (\"[The Court:] In other words, you are asking us to uphold <i>Austin</i> on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted in [the context of limits on political expenditures]. [The Government:] [I]n this particular context, fair enough\").</p>\r\n<p>To be clear: The Court in <i>Austin</i> nowhere relied upon the only arguments the Government now raises to support that decision. In fact, the only opinion in <i>Austin</i> endorsing the Government's argument based on the threat of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption was Justice STEVENS's concurrence. 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The Court itself did not do so, despite the fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument. Moreover, the Court's only discussion of shareholder protection in <i>Austin</i> appeared in a section of the opinion that sought merely to distinguish <i>Austin</i>'s facts from those of <i>Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-fo/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986). <i>Austin, supra,</i> at 663, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Nowhere did <i>Austin</i> suggest that the goal of protecting shareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing restrictions on First Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>To the extent that the Government's case for reaffirming <i>Austin</i> depends on radically reconceptualizing its reasoning, that argument is at odds with itself. <i>Stare decisis</i> is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones. There is therefore no basis for the Court to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has never accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to support a conclusion reached on different grounds that have since been abandoned or discredited.</p>\r\n<p>Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that justify <i>stare decisis</i> in the first place. It would effectively license the Court to invent and adopt new principles of constitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing its past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those principles have merit on their own. This approach would allow the Court's past missteps to spawn future mistakes, undercutting the very rule-of-law values that <i>stare decisis</i> is designed to protect.</p>\r\n<p>None of this is to say that the Government is barred from making new arguments to support the outcome in <i>Austin.</i> On the contrary, it is free to do so. And of course the Court is free to accept them. But the Government's new arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are not entitled to receive the special deference we accord to precedent. They are, as grounds to support <i>Austin,</i> literally <i>un</i>precedented. Moreover, to the extent the Government relies on new arguments and declines to defend <i>Austin</i> on its own termswe may reasonably infer that it lacks confidence in that decision's original justification.</p>\r\n<p>Because continued adherence to <i>Austin</i> threatens to subvert the \"principled and intelligible\" development of our First Amendment jurisprudence, <i>Vasquez,</i> 474 U.S., at 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, I support the Court's determination to overrule that decision.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>* * *</h2>\r\n<p>We have had two rounds of briefing in this case, two oral arguments, and 54 <i>amicus</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> briefs to help us carry out our obligation to decide the necessary constitutional questions according to law. We have also had the benefit of a comprehensive dissent that has helped ensure that the Court has considered all the relevant issues. This careful consideration convinces me that Congress violates the First Amendment when it decrees that some speakers may not engage in political speech at election time, when it matters most.</p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice ALITO joins, and with whom Justice THOMAS joins in part, concurring.</p>\r\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\r\n<p>I write separately to address Justice STEVENS' discussion of <i>\"Original Understandings,\" post,</i> at 948 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter referred to as the dissent). This section of the dissent purports to show that today's decision is not supported by the original understanding of the First Amendment. The dissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment. It never shows why \"the freedom of speech\" that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form. To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations could pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters; but the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in the pursuit of those objectives could be censored.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of taking this straightforward approach to determining the Amendment's meaning, the dissent embarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers' views about the \"role of corporations in society.\" <i>Post,</i> at 949. The Framers didn't like corporations, the dissent concludes, and therefore it follows (as night the day) that corporations had no rights of free speech. Of course the Framers' personal affection or disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected in the understood meaning of the text they enactednot, as the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for that text. But the dissent's distortion of proper analysis is even worse than that. Though faced with a constitutional text that makes no distinction between types of speakers, the dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated statement from the founding era to the effect that corporations are <i>not</i> covered, but places the burden on petitioners to bring forward statements showing that they <i>are</i> (\"there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,\" <i>post,</i> at 948).</p>\r\n<p>Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent has dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the 18th century corporations were despised. If so, how came there to be so many of them? The dissent's statement that there were few business corporations during the eighteenth century\"only a few hundred during all of the 18th century\"is misleading. <i>Post,</i> at 949, n. 53. There were approximately 335 charters issued to business corporations in the United States by the end of the 18th century.<sup>[2]</sup> See 2 J. &amp; Davis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*926</span> Essays in the Earlier History of American Corporations 24 (1917) (reprint 2006) (hereinafter Davis). This was a \"considerable extension of corporate enterprise in the field of business,\" Davis 8, and represented \"unprecedented growth,\" <i>id.,</i> at 309. Moreover, what seems like a small number by today's standards surely does not indicate the relative importance of corporations when the Nation was considerably smaller. As I have previously noted, \"[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life.\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 256, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting C. Cooke, Corporation Trust and Company 92 (1951) (hereinafter Cooke)).</p>\r\n<p>Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent's approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion. Most of the Founders' resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed.<sup>[3]</sup> Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Foundersexcluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society. Moreover, if the Founders' specific intent with respect to corporations is what matters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders' views about other legal entities that have more in common with modern business corporations than the founding-era corporations? At the time of the founding, religious, educational, and literary corporations were incorporated under general incorporation statutes, much as business corporations are today.<sup>[4]</sup> See Davis 16-17; R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784-1855, p. 5 (1982); Cooke 94. There were also small unincorporated business associations, which some have argued were the \"`true progenitors'\" of today's business corporations. Friedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American Land Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Development 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33. Were all of these silently excluded from the protections of the First Amendment?</p>\r\n<p>The lack of a textual exception for speech by corporations cannot be explained on the ground that such organizations did not exist or did not speak. To the contrary, colleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds had long been organized as corporations at common law and under the King's charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 455-473 (1765); 1 S. Kyd, A <span class=\"star-pagination\">*927</span> Treatise on the Law of Corporations 1-32, 63 (1793) (reprinted 2006), and as I have discussed, the practice of incorporation only expanded in the United States. Both corporations and voluntary associations actively petitioned the Government and expressed their views in newspapers and pamphlets. For example: An antislavery Quaker corporation petitioned the First Congress, distributed pamphlets, and communicated through the press in 1790. W. diGiacomantonio, \"For the Gratification of a Volunteering Society\": Antislavery and Pressure Group Politics in the First Federal Congress, 15 J. Early Republic 169 (1995). The New York Sons of Liberty sent a circular to colonies farther south in 1766. P. Maier, From Resistance to Revolution 79-80 (1972). And the Society for the Relief and Instruction of Poor Germans circulated a biweekly paper from 1755 to 1757. Adams, The Colonial German-language Press and the American Revolution, in The Press &amp; the American Revolution 151, 161-162 (B. Bailyn &amp; J. Hench eds.1980). The dissent offers no evidencenone whateverthat the First Amendment's unqualified text was originally understood to exclude such associational speech from its protection.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Historical evidence relating to the textually similar clause \"the freedom of ... the press\" also provides no support for the proposition that the First Amendment excludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope of its protection. The freedom of \"the press\" was widely understood to protect the publishing activities of individual editors and printers. See <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117921\"><a href=\"/opinion/117921/mcintyre-v-ohio-elections-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span>, 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 252-253, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But these individuals often acted through newspapers, which (much like corporations) had their own names, outlived the individuals who had founded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes owned by more than one person, and were operated for profit. See generally F. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*928</span> Mott, American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through 250 Years 3-164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom's Fetters (1956). Their activities were not stripped of First Amendment protection simply because they were carried out under the banner of an artificial legal entity. And the notion which follows from the dissent's view, that modern newspapers, since they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only at the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court's conception of corruption is unhistorical. The Framers \"would have been appalled,\" it says, by the evidence of corruption in the congressional findings supporting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. <i>Post,</i> at 963. For this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article arguing that \"corruption\" was originally understood to include \"moral decay\" and even actions taken by citizens in pursuit of private rather than public ends. Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.Rev. 341, 373, 378 (2009). It is hard to see how this has anything to do with what sort of corruption can be combated by restrictions on political speech. Moreover, if speech can be prohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads to \"moral decay\" or does not serve \"public ends,\" then there is no limit to the Government's censorship power.</p>\r\n<p>The dissent says that when the Framers \"constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.\" <i>Post,</i> at 950. That is no doubt true. All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and womennot, for example, of trees or polar bears. But the individual person's right to speak includes the right to speak <i>in association with other individual persons.</i> Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of \"an individual American.\" It is the speech of many individual Americans, who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party the right to speak on their behalf. The association of individuals in a business corporation is no differentor at least it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not \"an individual American.\"<sup>[7]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*929</span> But to return to, and summarize, my principal point, which is the conformity of today's opinion with the original meaning of the First Amendment. The Amendment is written in terms of \"speech,\" not speakers. Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individualsand the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion. We are therefore simply left with the question whether the speech at issue in this case is \"speech\" covered by the First Amendment. No one says otherwise. A documentary film critical of a potential Presidential candidate is core political speech, and its nature as such does not change simply because it was funded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that funding produce any reduction whatever in the \"inherent worth of the speech\" and \"its capacity for informing the public,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy. We should celebrate rather than condemn the addition of this speech to the public debate.</p>\r\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG, Justice BREYER, and Justice SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\r\n<p>The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, the appellant may finance its electioneering. Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets. Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and promote <i>Hillary: The Movie</i> wherever and whenever it wanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast <i>Hillary</i> at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election. Neither Citizens United's nor any other corporation's speech has been \"banned,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886. All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period. The notion that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided. Even more misguided is the notion that the Court must rewrite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*930</span> the law relating to campaign expenditures by <i>for-profit</i> corporations and unions to decide this case.</p>\r\n<p>The basic premise underlying the Court's ruling is its iteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker's identity, including its \"identity\" as a corporation. While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court's disposition of this case.</p>\r\n<p>In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant. Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or run for office. Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864. We have unanimously concluded that this \"reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process,\" <i>FEC v.

Because departures from those rules always enhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of this case in some detail before explaining why the Court's analysis rests on a faulty understanding of <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*931</span> of our campaign finance jurisprudence more generally.<sup>[1]</sup> I regret the length of what follows, but the importance and novelty of the Court's opinion require a full response. Although I concur in the Court's decision to sustain BCRA's disclosure provisions and join Part IV of its opinion, I emphatically dissent from its principal holding.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>I</h2>\r\n<p>The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution. Before turning to the question whether to overrule <i>Austin</i> and part of <i>McConnell,</i> it is important to explain why the Court should not be deciding that question.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Scope of the Case</i></h2>\r\n<p>The first reason is that the question was not properly brought before us. In declaring § 203 of BCRA facially unconstitutional on the ground that corporations' electoral expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently than those of individuals, the majority decides this case on a basis relinquished below, not included in the questions presented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in response to the Court's invitation. This procedure is unusual and inadvisable for a court.<sup>[2]</sup> Our colleagues' suggestion that \"we are asked to reconsider <i>Austin</i> and, in effect, <i>McConnell,\" ante,</i> at 886, would be more accurate if rephrased to state that \"we have asked ourselves\" to reconsider those cases.</p>\r\n<p>In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of § 203. App. 23a-24a. In its motion for summary judgment, however, Citizens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge, 1:07-cv-2240-RCL-RWR, Docket Entry No. 52, pp. 1-2 (May 16, 2008), and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of that claim, <i>id.,</i> Nos. 53 (May 22, 2008), 54 (May 23, 2008), App. 6a. The District Court therefore resolved the case on alternative grounds,<sup>[3]</sup> and in its jurisdictional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*932</span> statement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised us that it was raising only \"an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of ... BCRA § 203.\" Juris. Statement 5. The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited <i>Austin,</i> the key case the majority today overrules. And not one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to § 203 that it previously agreed to dismiss. In fact, not one of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens United's corporate status. Juris. Statement (i). Moreover, even in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected its request to overrule <i>Austin,</i> it never sought a declaration that § 203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corporations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute could not be applied to it because it was \"funded overwhelmingly by individuals.\" Brief for Appellant 29; see also <i>id.,</i> at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming \"as applied\" character of challenge to § 203); Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-9 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United conceding that § 203 could be applied to General Motors); <i>id.,</i> at 55 (counsel for Citizens United stating that \"we accept the Court's decision in <i>Wisconsin Right to Life</i>\").</p>\r\n<p>\"`It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed,' \" <i>Youakim v.

The appellant in this case did not so much as assert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the majority opinion in vain for the mention of any. That is unsurprising, for none exists.</p>\r\n<p>Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step, but it did not cure this fundamental problem. Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>As-Applied and Facial Challenges</i></h2>\r\n<p>This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years that \"[f]acial challenges are disfavored.\" <i>Washington State Grange v.

By declaring § 203 facially unconstitutional, our colleagues have turned an as-applied challenge into a facial challenge, in defiance of this principle.</p>\r\n<p>This is not merely a technical defect in the Court's decision. The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry \"run[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*933</span> that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\" <i>Washington State Grange,</i> 552 U.S., at 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted). Scanting that principle \"threaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 451, 128 S.Ct. 1184. These concerns are heightened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the legislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress' most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics. It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well.</p>\r\n<p>The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of this on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA § 203 can be applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed, through the normal process of litigation, a record about the <i>actual</i> effects of § 203, its actual burdens and its actual benefits, on <i>all</i> manner of corporations and unions.<sup>[4]</sup> \"Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,\" and consequently \"raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is nonexistent. Congress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert. The Court now negates Congress' efforts without a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority throws up its hands. Were we to confine our inquiry to Citizens United's as-applied challenge, it protests, we would commence an \"extended\" process of \"draw[ing], and then redraw[ing], constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*934</span> lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 891. While tacitly acknowledging that some applications of § 203 might be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a future in which novel First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad hoc basis, and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal restraint. Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies, may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins. The fluid nature of electioneering communications does not make this case special. The fact that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some point down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied problems, does not come close to meeting the standard for a facial challenge.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority proposes several other justifications for the sweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because, if the Court were to continue on its normal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they present themselves, that process would itself run afoul of the First Amendment. See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 890 (as-applied review process \"would raise questions as to the courts' own lawful authority\"); <i>ibid.</i> (\"Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment\"). This suggestion is perplexing. Our colleagues elsewhere trumpet \"our duty `to say what the law is,'\" even when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differently. <i>Ante,</i> at 913 (quoting <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). We do not typically say what the law <i>is not</i> as a hedge against future judicial error. The possibility that later courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that provision.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech. See <i>ante,</i> at 890-891, 892, 894-897. In addition to begging the question what types of corporate spending are constitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim rests on the assertion that some significant number of corporations have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*935</span> been cowed into quiescence by FEC \"`censor[ship].'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895-896. That assertion is unsubstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experience. It is particularly hard to square with the legal landscape following <i>WRTL,</i> which held that a corporate communication could be regulated under § 203 only if it was \"susceptible of <i>no</i> reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (emphasis added). The whole point of this test was to make § 203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election cycle, it has determined THE CHIEF JUSTICE's project to be a failure. In this respect, too, the majority's critique of line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied review method generally.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless preserved itnot as a freestanding \"claim,\" but as a potential argument in support of \"a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892-893; see also <i>ante,</i> at 919 (ROBERTS, C.J., concurring) (describing Citizens United's claim as: \"[T]he Act violates the First Amendment\"). By this novel logic, virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as \"a claim that the Government has violated my rights,\" and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim's disposition. Not only the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic relationship between litigants and courts, would be upended if the latter had free rein to construe the former's claims at such high levels of generality. There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the rest to us.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of Citizens United's claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is necessary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review article, it asserts that Citizens United's dismissal of the facial challenge does not prevent us \"`from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \"as-applied\" cases.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 893 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon)); accord, <i>ante,</i> at 919 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (\"Regardless whether we label Citizens United's claim a `facial' or `as-applied' challenge, the consequences of the Court's decision are the same\"). The majority is on firmer conceptual ground here. Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor Fallon's thesis, one must proceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*936</span> to ask <i>which</i> as-applied challenges, if successful, will \"properly\" invite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute.<sup>[10]</sup> The paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as this carries the necessary implication that all future as-applied challenges to the provision must prevail. See Fallon 1339-1340.</p>\r\n<p>Citizens United's as-applied challenge was not of this sort. Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention was that BCRA § 203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature-length video-on-demand film (such as <i>Hillary</i>) or to a nonprofit corporation exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4)<sup>[11]</sup> and funded overwhelmingly by individuals (such as itself). See Brief for Appellant 16-41. Success on either of these claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the validity of § 203 as applied to other types of broadcasts, other types of corporations, or unions. It certainly would not invalidate the statute as applied to a large for-profit corporation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is \"a small, nonprofit organization, which is very much like [an <i>MCFL</i> corporation],\" and affirming that its argument \"definitely would not be the same\" if <i>Hillary</i> were distributed by General Motors).<sup>[12]</sup> There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Narrower Grounds</i></h2>\r\n<p>It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*937</span> United, without toppling statutes and precedents. Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another \"cardinal\" principle of the judicial process: \"[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\" <i>PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186152\"><a href=\"/opinion/186152/pdk-lab-inc-v-dea/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span>, 799 (C.A.D.C.2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\r\n<p>Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision that the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify as an \"electioneering communication\" under § 203 of BCRA, 2 U.S.C. § 441b. BCRA defines that term to encompass certain communications transmitted by \"broadcast, cable, or satellite.\" § 434(f)(3)(A). When Congress was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very different sort of programming: short advertisements run on television or radio. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619. The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC's implementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on-demand transmissions. See Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17-19. In light of this ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on-demand, and \"[t]he elementary rule ... that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\" <i>Hooper v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94074\"><a href=\"/opinion/94074/hooper-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895), the Court could have reasonably ruled that § 203 does not apply to <i>Hillary.</i><sup>[13]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Second, the Court could have expanded the <i>MCFL</i> exemption to cover § 501(c)(4) nonprofits that accept only a <i>de minimis</i> amount of money from for-profit corporations. Citizens United professes to be such a group: Its brief says it \"is funded predominantly by donations from individuals who support [its] ideological message.\" Brief for Appellant 5. Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that <i>de minimis</i> business support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise qualifying organization from the ambit of <i>MCFL.</i><sup>[14]</sup> This Court could have simply followed their lead.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Finally, let us not forget Citizens United's as-applied constitutional challenge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*938</span> Precisely because Citizens United looks so much like the <i>MCFL</i> organizations we have exempted from regulation, while a feature-length video-on-demand film looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation, this challenge is a substantial one. As the appellant's own arguments show, the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must always be treated identicallyand always spared expenditures restrictionsin the political realm. Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review process that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation since <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> and that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in <i>WRTL,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329.</p>\r\n<p>This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case could have been decided is not meant to show that any of these grounds is ideal, though each is perfectly \"valid,\" <i>ante,</i> at 892 (majority opinion).<sup>[16]</sup> It is meant to show that there were principled, narrower paths that a Court that was serious about judicial restraint could have taken. There was also the straightforward path: applying <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> just as the District Court did in holding that the funding of Citizens United's film can be regulated under them. The only thing preventing the majority from affirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower ground that would retain <i>Austin,</i> is its disdain for <i>Austin.</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>II</h2>\r\n<p>The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is the most transparent: <i>stare decisis.</i> I am not an absolutist when it comes to <i>stare decisis,</i> in the campaign finance area or in any other. No one is. But if this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law, it must at least demand a significant justification, beyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning settled doctrine. \"[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). No such justification exists in this case, and to the contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our precedents.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Court's central argument for why <i>stare decisis</i> ought to be trumped is that it does not like <i>Austin.</i> The opinion \"was not well reasoned,\" our colleagues assert, and it conflicts with First Amendment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*939</span> principles. <i>Ante,</i> at 912. This, of course, is the Court's merits argument, the many defects in which we will soon consider. I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it. But neither is true of <i>Austin,</i> as I explain at length in Parts III and IV, <i>infra,</i> at 942-979, and restating a merits argument with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in the <i>stare decisis</i> calculus.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supplements its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The Court proclaims that \"<i>Austin</i> is undermined by experience since its announcement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 912. This is a curious claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The majority has no empirical evidence with which to substantiate the claim; we just have its <i>ipse dixit</i> that the real world has not been kind to <i>Austin.</i> Nor does the majority bother to specify in what sense <i>Austin</i> has been \"undermined.\" Instead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs: \"Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing,\" <i>ante,</i> at 912; \"[s]peakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages,\" <i>ibid.;</i> \"[c]orporations ... do not have monolithic views,\" <i>ibid.</i> How any of these ruminations weakens the force of <i>stare decisis,</i> escapes my comprehension.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority also contends that the Government's hesitation to rely on <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale \"diminishe[s]\" \"the principle of adhering to that precedent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 912; see also <i>ante,</i> at 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (Government's litigating position is \"most importan[t]\" factor undermining <i>Austin</i>). Why it diminishes the value of <i>stare decisis</i> is left unexplained. We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can often be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may have strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing only a subset of them. Members of the public, moreover, often rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our precise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been regulating corporate electioneering since <i>Austin.</i> The task of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*940</span> Although the majority opinion spends several pages making these surprising arguments, it says almost nothing about the standard considerations we have used to determine <i>stare decisis</i> value, such as the antiquity of the precedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reliance interests at stake. It is also conspicuously silent about <i>McConnell,</i> even though the <i>McConnell</i> Court's decision to uphold BCRA § 203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of <i>Austin</i> but also on the statute's historical pedigree, see, <i>e.g.,</i> 540 U.S., at 115-132, 223-224, 124 S.Ct. 619, and the need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns, see <i>id.,</i> at 126-129, 205-208, and n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>We have recognized that \"<i>[s]tare decisis</i> has special force when legislators or citizens `have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.'\" <i>Hubbard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117931\"><a href=\"/opinion/117931/hubbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span>, 714, 115 S.Ct. 1754, 131 L.Ed.2d 779 (1995) (quoting <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112669\"><a href=\"/opinion/112669/hilton-v-south-carolina-public-railways-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991)). <i>Stare decisis</i> protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion. Today's decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise. State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in <i>Austin,</i> for more than a century.<sup>[20]</sup> The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on <i>Austin</i> throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA. The total record it compiled was <i>100,000 pages</i> long.<sup>[21]</sup> Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of § 203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.</p>\r\n<p>By removing one of its central components, today's ruling makes a hash out of BCRA's \"delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 172, 124 S.Ct. 619. Consider just one example of the distortions that will follow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or spending \"soft money,\" funds that are not subject to the statute's disclosure requirements or its source and amount limitations. 2 U.S.C. § 441i; <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 122-126, 124 S.Ct. 619. Going forward, corporations and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific candidates, whereas national parties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of any kind. The Court's ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of corporations and unionsand the narrow interests they representvis-à-vis the role of political partiesand the broad coalitions they representin determining who will hold public office.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other <i>stare decisis</i> factors also cut against the Court. Considerations of antiquity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*941</span> are significant for similar reasons. <i>McConnell</i> is only six years old, but <i>Austin</i> has been on the books for two decades, and many of the statutes called into question by today's opinion have been on the books for a half-century or more. The Court points to no intervening change in circumstances that warrants revisiting <i>Austin.</i> Certainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided <i>WRTL</i> two Terms ago. And the Court gives no reason to think that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are unworkable.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, no one has argued to us that <i>Austin</i>'s rule has proved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corporation, union, or State has asked us to overrule it. Quite to the contrary, leading groups representing the business community,<sup>[23]</sup> organized labor,<sup>[24]</sup> and the nonprofit sector,<sup>[25]</sup> together with more than half of the States,<sup>[26]</sup> urge that we preserve <i>Austin.</i> As for <i>McConnell,</i> the portions of BCRA it upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Government have worked to make § 203 as user-friendly as possible. For instance, Congress established a special mechanism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see note following 2 U.S.C. § 437h; the FEC has established a standardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors, for corporations to claim that a particular electioneering communication is permissible under <i>WRTL,</i> see 11 CFR § 114.15 (2009);<sup>[27]</sup> and, as noted above, THE CHIEF JUSTICE crafted his controlling opinion in <i>WRTL</i> with the express goal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U.S., at 469-470, 473-474, 127 S.Ct. 2652. The case for <i>stare decisis</i> may be bolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings \"have reduced the impact\" of a precedent \"while reaffirming the decision's core ruling.\" <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).<sup>[28]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the end, the Court's rejection of <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> comes down to nothing more than its disagreement with their results. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*942</span> Virtually every one of its arguments was made and rejected in those cases, and the majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents. The only relevant thing that has changed since <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> is the composition of this Court. Today's ruling thus strikes at the vitals of <i>stare decisis,</i> \"the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion\" that \"permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\" <i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111552\"><a href=\"/opinion/111552/vasquez-v-hillery/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986).</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>III</h2>\r\n<p>The novelty of the Court's procedural dereliction and its approach to <i>stare decisis</i> is matched by the novelty of its ruling on the merits. The ruling rests on several premises. First, the Court claims that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> have \"banned\" corporate speech. Second, it claims that the First Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on speaker identity, including the speaker's identity as a corporation. Third, it claims that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our campaign finance jurisprudence. Each of these claims is wrong.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>The So-Called \"Ban\"</i></h2>\r\n<p>Pervading the Court's analysis is the ominous image of a \"categorical ba[n]\" on corporate speech. <i>Ante,</i> at 910. Indeed, the majority invokes the specter of a \"ban\" on nearly every page of its opinion. <i>Ante,</i> at 886-887, 889, 891-892, 894, 896-898, 900-907, 909-912, 915, 916. This characterization is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected.</p>\r\n<p>In fact it already has been. Our cases have repeatedly pointed out that, \"[c]ontrary to the [majority's] critical assumptions,\" the statutes upheld in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> do \"not impose an <i>absolute</i> ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391; see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 203-204, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 162-163, 123 S.Ct. 2200. For starters, both statutes provide exemptions for PACs, separate segregated funds established by a corporation for political purposes. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 169.255 (West 2005). \"The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds,\" we observed in <i>McConnell,</i> \"has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been this Court's unanimous view.\" 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Under BCRA, any corporation's \"stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families\" can pool their resources to finance electioneering communications. 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). A significant and growing number of corporations avail themselves of this option;<sup>[29]</sup> during the most recent election cycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion dollars.<sup>[30]</sup> Administering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*943</span> a PAC entails some administrative burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds, see <i>ante,</i> at 914, and no one has suggested that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit corporation. To the extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is, just the majority's own unsupported factfinding, see <i>ante,</i> at 897-898. Like all other natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form. The owners of a \"mom &amp; pop\" store can simply place ads in their own names, rather than the store's. If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form, they may utilize an <i>MCFL</i> organization that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit for business or union interests. See <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 263-264, 107 S.Ct. 616.</p>\r\n<p>The laws upheld in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> leave open many additional avenues for corporations' political speech. Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluating in this case, BCRA § 203. It has no application to genuine issue advertisinga category of corporate speech Congress found to be far more substantial than election-related advertising, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619or to Internet, telephone, and print advocacy.<sup>[31]</sup> Like numerous statutes, it exempts media companies' news stories, commentaries, and editorials from its electioneering restrictions, in recognition of the unique role played by the institutional press in sustaining public debate.<sup>[32]</sup> See 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(B)(i); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 208-209, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 666-668, 110 S.Ct. 1391. It also allows corporations to spend unlimited sums on political communications with their executives and shareholders, § 441b(b)(2)(A); 11 CFR § 114.3(a)(1), to fund additional PAC activity through trade associations, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(D), to distribute voting guides and voting records, 11 CFR §§ 114.4(c)(4)-(5), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*944</span> to underwrite voter registration and voter turnout activities, § 114.3(c)(4); § 114.4(c)(2), to host fundraising events for candidates within certain limits, § 114.4(c); § 114.2(f)(2), and to publicly endorse candidates through a press release and press conference, § 114.4(c)(6).</p>\r\n<p>At the time Citizens United brought this lawsuit, the only types of speech that could be regulated under § 203 were: (1) broadcast, cable, or satellite communications;<sup>[33]</sup> (2) capable of reaching at least 50,000 persons in the relevant electorate;<sup>[34]</sup> (3) made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general federal election;<sup>[35]</sup> (4) by a labor union or a non-<i>MCFL,</i> nonmedia corporation;<sup>[36]</sup> (5) paid for with general treasury funds;<sup>[37]</sup> and (6) \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\"<sup>[38]</sup> The category of communications meeting all of these criteria is not trivial, but the notion that corporate political speech has been \"suppress[ed] ... altogether,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, that corporations have been \"exclu[ded]... from the general public dialogue,\" <i>ante,</i> at 899, or that a work of fiction such as <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> might be covered, <i>ante,</i> at 916-917, is nonsense.<sup>[39]</sup> Even the plaintiffs in <i>McConnell,</i> who had every incentive to depict BCRA as negatively as possible, declined to argue that § 203's prohibition on certain uses of general treasury funds amounts to a complete ban. See 540 U.S., at 204, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>In many ways, then, § 203 functions as a source restriction or a time, place, and manner restriction. It applies in a viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office, made during discrete time periods through discrete channels. In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast <i>Hillary</i> right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC, which by its own account is \"one of the most active conservative PACs in America,\" Citizens United Political Victory Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/.<sup>[40]</sup></p>\r\n<p>So let us be clear: Neither <i>Austin</i> nor <i>McConnell</i> held or implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a \"censor\"; and in the years since these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*945</span> cases were decided, corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue. Laws such as § 203 target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process, that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens, and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden political speech, and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scrutiny. But the majority's incessant talk of a \"ban\" aims at a straw man.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Identity-Based Distinctions</i></h2>\r\n<p>The second pillar of the Court's opinion is its assertion that \"the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker's ... identity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 902; accord, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 898, 900, 902-904, 912-913. The case on which it relies for this proposition is <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). As I shall explain, <i>infra,</i> at 958-960, the holding in that case was far narrower than the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfettered discourse, the Court's denunciation of identity-based distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures reality.</p>\r\n<p>\"Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation\" of the First Amendment. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the press, that text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind. Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that speech can be regulated differentially on account of the speaker's identity, when identity is understood in categorical or institutional terms. The Government routinely places special restrictions on the speech rights of students,<sup>[41]</sup> prisoners,<sup>[42]</sup> members of the Armed Forces,<sup>[43]</sup> foreigners,<sup>[44]</sup> and its own employees.<sup>[45]</sup> When such restrictions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*946</span> they do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.<sup>[46]</sup> In contrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses, our cases recognize that the Government's interests may be more or less compelling with respect to different classes of speakers,<sup>[47]</sup> cf. <i>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110894\"><a href=\"/opinion/110894/minneapolis-star-tribune-co-v-minnesota-commr-of-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 585, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983) (\"[D]ifferential treatment\" is constitutionally suspect \"<i>unless</i> justified by some special characteristic\" of the regulated class of speakers (emphasis added)), and that the constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers, in certain contexts, \"`are not automatically coextensive with the rights'\" that are normally accorded to members of our society, <i>Morse v. Frederick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145707\"><a href=\"/opinion/145707/morse-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 396-397, 404, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (quoting <i>Bethel School Dist.

It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine has \"frowned on\" certain identity-based distinctions, <i>Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span>, 47, n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 483, 145 L.Ed.2d 451 (1999) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), particularly those that may reflect invidious discrimination or preferential treatment of a politically powerful group. But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or content. Not even close.</p>\r\n<p>The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely guards political speech. But in this context, too, the authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled. We have, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to exclude independent candidates from televised debates. <i>Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118208\"><a href=\"/opinion/118208/arkansas-ed-television-commn-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998).<sup>[48]</sup> We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distribution or display of campaign materials near a polling place. <i>Burson v.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441e(a)(1). And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees, but not others, from contributing to or participating in political activities. See n. 45, <i>supra.</i> These statutes burden the political expression of one class of speakers, namely, civil servants. Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and Congress' reasoned judgment that certain regulations which leave \"untouched full participation ... in political decisions at the ballot box,\" <i>Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108857\"><a href=\"/opinion/108857/uscsc-v-national-association-of-letter-carriers/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 556, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), help ensure that public officials are \"sufficiently free from improper influences,\" <i>id.,</i> at 564, 93 S.Ct. 2880, and that \"confidence in the system of representative Government is not ... eroded to a disastrous extent,\" <i>id.,</i> at 565, 93 S.Ct. 2880.</p>\r\n<p>The same logic applies to this case with additional force because it is the identity of corporations, rather than individuals, that the Legislature has taken into account. As we have unanimously observed, legislatures are entitled to decide \"that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation\" in an electoral context. <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552.<sup>[50]</sup> Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized, but within the area of campaign finance, corporate spending is also \"furthest from the core of political expression, since corporations' First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information,\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 161, n. 8, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (citation omitted). Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because the \"speakers\" are not natural persons, much less members of our political community, and the governmental interests are of the highest order. Furthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished from noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimination or political favoritism.</p>\r\n<p>If taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has <i>no</i> relevance to the Government's ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by \"Tokyo Rose\" during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*948</span> controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \"`enhance the relative voice'\" of some (<i>i.e.,</i> humans) over others (<i>i.e.,</i> nonhumans). <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612).<sup>[51]</sup> Under the majority's view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.<sup>[52]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In short, the Court dramatically overstates its critique of identity-based distinctions, without ever explaining why corporate identity demands the same treatment as individual identity. Only the most wooden approach to the First Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it seeks to draw.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Our First Amendment Tradition</i></h2>\r\n<p>A third fulcrum of the Court's opinion is the idea that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are radical outliers, \"aberration[s],\" in our First Amendment tradition. <i>Ante,</i> at 907; see also <i>ante,</i> at 910, 916-917 (professing fidelity to \"our law and our tradition\"). The Court has it exactly backwards. It is today's holding that is the radical departure from what had been settled First Amendment law. To see why, it is useful to take a long view.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>1. <i>Original Understandings</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Let us start from the beginning. The Court invokes \"ancient First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886 (internal quotation marks omitted), and original understandings, <i>ante,</i> at 906-907, to defend today's ruling, yet it makes only a perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the principles or understandings of those who drafted and ratified the Amendment. Perhaps this is because there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed it would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form. To the extent that the Framers' views are discernible and relevant to the disposition of this case, they would appear to cut strongly against the majority's position.</p>\r\n<p>This is not only because the Framers and their contemporaries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now think of it, see Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*949</span> L.J. 1, 22 (1971), but also because they held very different views about the nature of the First Amendment right and the role of corporations in society. Those few corporations that existed at the founding were authorized by grant of a special legislative charter.<sup>[53]</sup> Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature, and the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter that specified the corporation's powers and purposes and \"authoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate organization,\" including \"the internal structure of the corporation.\" J. Hurst, The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States 1780-1970, pp. 15-16 (1970) (reprint 2004). Corporations were created, supervised, and conceptualized as quasi-public entities, \"designed to serve a social function for the state.\" Handlin &amp; Handlin, Origin of the American Business Corporation, 5 J. Econ. Hist. 1, 22 (1945). It was \"assumed that [they] were legally privileged organizations that had to be closely scrutinized by the legislature because their purposes had to be made consistent with public welfare.\" R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784-1855, p. 5 (1982).</p>\r\n<p>The individualized charter mode of incorporation reflected the \"cloud of disfavor under which corporations labored\" in the early years of this Nation. 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 2, p. 8 (rev. ed.2006); see also <i>Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102059\"><a href=\"/opinion/102059/louis-k-liggett-co-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 548-549, 53 S.Ct. 481, 77 L.Ed. 929 (1933) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (discussing fears of the \"evils\" of business corporations); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed.1985) (\"The word `soulless' constantly recurs in debates over corporations.... Corporations, it was feared, could concentrate the worst urges of whole groups of men\"). Thomas Jefferson famously fretted that corporations would subvert the Republic.<sup>[54]</sup> General incorporation statutes, and widespread acceptance of business corporations as socially useful actors, did not emerge until the 1800's. See Hansmann &amp; Kraakman, The End of History for Corporate Law, 89 Geo. L.J. 439, 440 (2001) (hereinafter Hansmann &amp; Kraakman) (\"[A]ll general business corporation statutes appear to date from well after 1800\").</p>\r\n<p>The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively <span class=\"star-pagination\">*950</span> regulated in the service of the public welfare. Unlike our colleagues, they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.<sup>[55]</sup> While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights, business corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends. Even \"the notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,\" given that \"at the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign.\" Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate Speech, 18 Hastings Const. L.Q. 541, 578 (1991); cf. <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85282\"><a href=\"/opinion/85282/dartmouth-college-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 636, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Marshall, C.J.) (\"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it\"); Eule, Promoting Speaker Diversity: Austin and Metro Broadcasting, 1990 S.Ct. Rev. 105, 129 (\"The framers of the First Amendment could scarcely have anticipated its application to the corporation form. That, of course, ought not to be dispositive. What is compelling, however, is an understanding of who was supposed to be the beneficiary of the free speech guarantythe individual\"). In light of these background practices and understandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers believed \"the freedom of speech\" would extend equally to all corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to guard against corporate capture of elections.</p>\r\n<p>The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse intellectual sources, communicated through newspapers, and aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed in England. <i>Ante,</i> at 906. From these (accurate) observations, the Court concludes that \"[t]he First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society's most salient media.\" <i>Ibid.</i> This conclusion is far from certain, given that many historians believe the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication and did not understand the First Amendment to \"prevent the subsequent punishment of such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*951</span> <i>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101773\"><a href=\"/opinion/101773/near-v-minnesota-ex-rel-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 714, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). Yet, even if the majority's conclusion were correct, it would tell us only that the First Amendment was understood to protect political speech <i>in</i> certain media. It would tell us little about whether the Amendment was understood to protect general treasury electioneering expenditures <i>by</i> corporations, <i>and to what extent.</i></p>\r\n<p>As a matter of original expectations, then, it seems absurd to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor of electoral advocacy. As a matter of original meaning, it likewise seems baselessunless one evaluates the First Amendment's \"principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, or its \"purpose,\" <i>ante,</i> at 919-920 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), at such a high level of generality that the historical understandings of the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judicial task. This case sheds a revelatory light on the assumption of some that an impartial judge's application of an originalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the decisional process, than his or her views about sound policy.</p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA criticizes the foregoing discussion for failing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that corporations were understood to be excluded from the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. <i>Ante,</i> at 925-926, 929. Of course, Justice SCALIA adduces no statements to suggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that the contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right that the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause thought they were enshrining. Although Justice SCALIA makes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual's right to speak entails a right to speak with others for a common cause, cf. <i>MCFL,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-fo/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539, he does not explain why those two rights must be precisely identical, or why that principle applies to electioneering by corporations that serve no \"common cause.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 928. Nothing in his account dislodges my basic point that members of the founding generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they \"despised\" corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 925), and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms. If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech, that may well be because the contrary propositionif not also the very notion of \"corporate speech\" was inconceivable.<sup>[56]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Justice SCALIA also emphasizes the unqualified nature of the First Amendment text. <i>Ante,</i> at 925, 928-929. Yet he would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally? <i>Ante,</i> at 927.<sup>[57]</sup> Like virtually all modern lawyers, Justice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*952</span> SCALIA presumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Executive, even though its language refers to Congress alone. In any event, the text only leads us back to the questions who or what is guaranteed \"the freedom of speech,\" and, just as critically, what that freedom consists of and under what circumstances it may be limited. Justice SCALIA appears to believe that because corporations are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as night the day) that their electioneering must be equally protected by the First Amendment and equally immunized from expenditure limits. See <i>ante,</i> at 928-929. That conclusion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and Justice SCALIA fails to explain why the original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA § 203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amendment.<sup>[58]</sup> I have given several reasons why I believe the Constitution would have been understood then, and ought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restrictions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many more reasons in the pages to come. The Court enlists the Framers in its defense without seriously grappling with their understandings of corporations or the free speech right, or with the republican principles that underlay those understandings.</p>\r\n<p>In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has never attended very closely to the views of the Framers, see <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145630\"><a href=\"/opinion/145630/randall-v-sorrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 280, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), whose political universe differed profoundly from that of today. We have long since held that corporations are covered by the First Amendment, and many legal scholars have long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation. But \"historical context is usually relevant,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted), and in light of the Court's effort to cast itself as guardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today's outcome. To the contrary, this history helps illuminate just how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2. <i>Legislative and Judicial Interpretation</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today's ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition. At the federal level, the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corporate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on the legislation observed that \"[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*953</span> argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials.\" S.Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906). President Roosevelt, in his 1905 annual message to Congress, declared:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"`All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.'\" <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105465\"><a href=\"/opinion/105465/united-states-v-automobile-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 572, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957) (quoting 40 Cong. Rec. 96).</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the Tillman Act several times, see <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 508-510, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 115, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 570-575, 77 S.Ct. 529, and I will refrain from doing so again. It is enough to say that the Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first, the enormous power corporations had come to wield in federal elections, with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and a public perception of corruption; and second, a respect for the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the use of their money to support candidates they opposed. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>United States v. CIO,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104588\"><a href=\"/opinion/104588/united-states-v-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 113, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948); Winkler, \"Other People's Money\": Corporations, Agency Costs, and Campaign Finance Law, 92 Geo. L.J. 871 (2004).</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, the limitations on corporate political spending have been modified in a number of ways, as Congress responded to changes in the American economy and political practices that threatened to displace the commonweal. Justice Souter recently traced these developments at length.<sup>[59]</sup><i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 507-519, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (dissenting opinion); see also <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 115-133, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 188-205. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case. In that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress extended the prohibition on corporate support of candidates to cover not only direct contributions, but independent expenditures as well. Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, § 304, 61 Stat. 159. The bar on contributions \"was being so narrowly construed\" that corporations were easily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting candidates through other means. <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 511, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing S.Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39 (1947)).</p>\r\n<p>Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions, even though the Court declined to pass on its constitutionality. <i>Ante,</i> at 900-901. Two features of these cases are of far greater relevance. First, those Justices were writing separately; which is to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> say, their position failed to command a majority. Prior to today, this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents. Second, each case in this line expressed support for the principle that corporate and union political speech financed with PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organization's stockholders or members, receives greater protection than speech financed with general treasury funds.<sup>[60]</sup></p>\r\n<p>This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, which retained the restriction on using general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a). FECA codified the option for corporations and unions to create PACs to finance contributions and expenditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself. § 441b(b).</p>\r\n<p>By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on corporate contributions and expenditures had become such an accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation that when a large number of plaintiffs, including several nonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of the Act in <i>Buckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, no one even bothered to argue that the bar as such was unconstitutional. <i>Buckley</i> famously (or infamously) distinguished direct contributions from independent expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 58-59, 96 S.Ct. 612, but its silence on corporations only reinforced the understanding that corporate expenditures could be treated differently from individual expenditures. \"Since our decision in <i>Buckley,</i> Congress' power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that Congress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting nonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*955</span> that Congress' \"careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cautious advance, step by step, to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations . . . warrants considerable deference,\" and \"reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process.\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209, 103 S.Ct. 552 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"The governmental interest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected representatives has long been recognized,\" the unanimous Court observed, \"and there is no reason why it may not . . . be accomplished by treating . . . corporations . . . differently from individuals.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 210-211, 103 S.Ct. 552.</p>\r\n<p>The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned by the Court's disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the expenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonprofit corporation.

Those aggregations can distort the \"free trade in ideas\" crucial to candidate elections, <i>ibid.,</i> at the expense of members or shareholders who may disagree with the object of the expenditures, <i>id.,</i> at 260, 107 S.Ct. 616 (internal quotation marks omitted). What the Court held by a 5-to-4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures, because Congress' interests in protecting shareholders and \"restrict[ing] `the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616 (quoting <i>FEC v.

(internal quotation marks omitted). Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of corporate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> political speech could be no more stringent than of speech by an individual.</p>\r\n<p>Four years later, in <i>Austin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652, we considered whether corporations falling outside the <i>MCFL</i> exception could be barred from using general treasury funds to make independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates. We held they could be. Once again recognizing the importance of \"the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas\" in candidate elections, <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 257, 107 S.Ct. 616, we noted that corporations have \"special advantagessuch as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets,\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391that allow them to spend prodigious general treasury sums on campaign messages that have \"little or no correlation\" with the beliefs held by actual persons, <i>id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have on the political process, <i>ibid.,</i> we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations' PACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus \"reflect actual public support for the political ideals espoused by corporations,\" <i>ibid.</i> Notwithstanding our colleagues' insinuations that <i>Austin</i> deprived the public of general \"ideas,\" \"facts,\" and \"knowledge,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906-907, the decision addressed only candidate-focused expenditures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate spending on other matters.</p>\r\n<p>In the 20 years since <i>Austin,</i> we have reaffirmed its holding and rationale a number of times, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 153-156, 123 S.Ct. 2200, most importantly in <i>McConnell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491, where we upheld the provision challenged here, § 203 of BCRA.<sup>[62]</sup> Congress crafted § 203 in response to a problem created by <i>Buckley.</i> The <i>Buckley</i> Court had construed FECA's definition of prohibited \"expenditures\" narrowly to avoid any problems of constitutional vagueness, holding it applicable only to \"communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,\" 424 U.S., at 80, 96 S.Ct. 612, <i>i.e.,</i> statements containing so-called \"magic words\" like \"`vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,' `defeat,' [or] `reject,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 43-44, and n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612. After <i>Buckley,</i> corporations and unions figured out how to circumvent the limits on express advocacy by using sham \"issue ads\" that \"eschewed the use of magic words\" but nonetheless \"advocate[d] the election or defeat of clearly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*957</span> identified federal candidates.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 126, 124 S.Ct. 619. \"Corporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 127, 124 S.Ct. 619. Congress passed § 203 to address this circumvention, prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for electioneering communications that \"refe[r] to a clearly identified candidate,\" whether or not those communications use the magic words. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I).</p>\r\n<p>When we asked in <i>McConnell</i> \"whether a compelling governmental interest justifie[d]\" § 203, we found the question \"easily answered\": \"We have repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at `the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.'\" 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391). These precedents \"represent respect for the legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation.\" 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Moreover, recent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against `\"circumvention of [valid] contribution limits.\"'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 155, 123 S.Ct. 2200, in turn quoting <i>FEC v.

BCRA, we found, is faithful to the compelling governmental interests in \"`preserving the integrity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, . . . sustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of the government,'\" and maintaining \"`the individual citizen's confidence in government.'\" 540 U.S., at 206-207, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407; some internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). What made the answer even easier than it might have been otherwise was the option to form PACs, which give corporations, at the least, \"a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in\" independent expenditures. 540 U.S., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>3. <i>Buckley and Bellotti</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Against this extensive background of congressional regulation of corporate campaign spending, and our repeated affirmation of this regulation as constitutionally sound, the majority dismisses <i>Austin</i> as \"a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886 (internal quotation marks omitted). How does the majority attempt to justify this claim? Selected passages from two cases, <i>Buckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, and <i>Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, do all of the work. In the Court's view, <i>Buckley</i> and <i>Bellotti</i> decisively rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from natural persons in the 1970's; it just so happens that in every single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign finance legislation in the decades since, the majority failed to grasp this truth. The Federal Congress and dozens of state legislatures, we now know, have been similarly deluded.</p>\r\n<p>The majority emphasizes <i>Buckley</i>'s statement that \"`[t]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting 424 U.S., at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612); <i>ante,</i> at 921 (opinion of ROBERTS, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*958</span> C.J.). But this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it. For one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit numerous \"restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many\": for example, restrictions on ballot access and on legislators' floor time. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118335\"><a href=\"/opinion/118335/nixon-v-shrink-missouri-government-pac/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 402, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring). For another, the <i>Buckley</i> Court used this line in evaluating \"the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\" 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612. It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case before us. The majority suggests that <i>Austin</i> rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization, <i>ante,</i> at 904-905; <i>ante,</i> at 921-922 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), but we made it clear in <i>Austin</i> (as in several cases before and since) that a restriction on the way corporations spend their money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of some elements of our society in preference to others. Indeed, we <i>expressly</i> ruled that the compelling interest supporting Michigan's statute was not one of \"`equaliz[ing] the relative influence of speakers on elections,'\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>id.,</i> at 705, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)), but rather the need to confront the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy financed by general treasury dollars, <i>id.,</i> at 659-660, 110 S.Ct. 1391.</p>\r\n<p>For that matter, it should go without saying that when we made this statement in <i>Buckley,</i> we could not have been casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expenditures in candidate elections, which had not been challenged as \"foreign to the First Amendment,\" <i>ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 49, 96 S.Ct. 612), or for any other reason. <i>Buckley</i>'s independent expenditure analysis was focused on a very different statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. § 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V). It is implausible to think, as the majority suggests, <i>ante,</i> at 901-902, that <i>Buckley</i> covertly invalidated FECA's separate corporate and union campaign expenditure restriction, § 610 (now codified at 2 U.S.C. § 441b), even though that restriction had been on the books for decades before <i>Buckley</i> and would remain on the books, undisturbed, for decades after.</p>\r\n<p>The case on which the majority places even greater weight than <i>Buckley,</i> however, is <i>Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, claiming it \"could not have been clearer\" that <i>Bellotti</i>'s holding forbade distinctions between corporate and individual expenditures like the one at issue here, <i>ante,</i> at 902. The Court's reliance is odd. The only thing about <i>Bellotti</i> that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority's position. <i>Bellotti</i> ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding, that \"our consideration of a corporation's right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407; see also <i>id.,</i> at 787-788, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving public confidence in Government and protecting dissenting shareholders may be \"weighty . . . in the context of partisan candidate elections\"). <i>Bellotti,</i> in other words, did not touch the question presented in <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it.</p>\r\n<p>The majority attempts to explain away the distinction <i>Bellotti</i> drewbetween general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*959</span> as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with <i>Buckley. Ante,</i> at 903, 909-910. Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections, the \"importance\" of which \"has never been doubted,\" 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda. A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the corporation's retaliation. Cf. <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (STEVENS, J., concurring); <i>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110588\"><a href=\"/opinion/110588/citizens-against-rent-controlcoalition-for-fair-ho/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 299, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). The majority likewise overlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases have repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinction. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S., at 495-496, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111248\"><a href=\"/opinion/111248/fcc-v-league-of-women-voters-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 371, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 552. The Court's critique of <i>Bellotti</i>'s footnote 26 puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate <i>Bellotti</i> to canonical status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with <i>Buckley. Bellotti,</i> apparently, is both the font of all wisdom and internally incoherent.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>Bellotti</i> Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a state statute that barred business corporations' expenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifically, the statute barred a business corporation \"from making contributions or expenditures `for the purpose of. . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation,'\" 435 U.S., at 768, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55, § 8 (West Supp.1977); alteration in original), and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not \"`be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation,'\" 435 U.S., at 768, 98 S.Ct. 1407. As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. See <i>id.,</i> at 769-770, and n. 3, 98 S.Ct. 1407. We said that \"where, as here, the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (footnote omitted).</p>\r\n<p><i>Bellotti</i> thus involved a <i>viewpoint-discriminatory</i> statute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that \"a very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth's referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 827, n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 1407. To make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs. <i>Id.,</i> at 768, n. 2, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (opinion of the Court). This really was a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*960</span> complete ban on a specific, preidentified subject. See <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 259, n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 616 (stating that 2 U.S.C. § 441b's expenditure restriction \"is <i>of course distinguishable</i> from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in the state referendum context in . . . <i>Bellotti</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\r\n<p>The majority grasps a quotational straw from <i>Bellotti,</i> that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corporation. <i>Ante,</i> at 902-903. Of course not, but no one suggests the contrary and neither <i>Austin</i> nor <i>McConnell</i> held otherwise. They held that even though the expenditures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a compelling state interest. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 658, 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. We acknowledged in <i>Bellotti</i> that numerous \"interests of the highest importance\" can justify campaign finance regulation. 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407. But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law. <i>Id.,</i> at 789, 98 S.Ct. 1407. We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been \"record or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell,</i> then, sit perfectly well with <i>Bellotti.</i> Indeed, all six Members of the <i>Austin</i> majority had been on the Court at the time of <i>Bellotti,</i> and none so much as hinted in <i>Austin</i> that they saw any tension between the decisions. The difference between the cases is not that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas <i>Bellotti</i> accepted it. The difference is that the statute at issue in <i>Bellotti</i> smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>* * *</h2>\r\n<p>In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to \"`[p]reserv[e] the integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . . sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,'\" protect the expressive interests of shareholders, and \"`[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen's confidence in government.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 206-207, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788-789, 98 S.Ct. 1407; first alteration in original). These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 570-575, 77 S.Ct. 529, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, see <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 511, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting), FECA in 1971, see <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552, and BCRA in 2002, see <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 126-132, 124 S.Ct. 619. Continuously for over 100 years, this line of \"[c]ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 522, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). Time and again, we have recognized these realities in approving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*961</span> measures that Congress and the States have taken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary. The only thing new about <i>Austin</i> was the dissent, with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>IV</h2>\r\n<p>Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in which to revisit <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> and why these decisions sit perfectly well with \"First Amendment principles,\" <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, I come at last to the interests that are at stake. The majority recognizes that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> may be defended on anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales. <i>Ante,</i> at 903-911. It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales, which overlap and complement each other, and in applying them to the case at hand.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>The Anticorruption Interest</i></h2>\r\n<p>Undergirding the majority's approach to the merits is the claim that the only \"sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption\" is one that is \"limited to <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 909-910. This is the same \"crabbed view of corruption\" that was espoused by Justice KENNEDY in <i>McConnell</i> and squarely rejected by the Court in that case. 540 U.S., at 152, 124 S.Ct. 619. While it is true that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the approach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my judgment. It disregards our constitutional history and the fundamental demands of a democratic society.</p>\r\n<p>On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress' legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an \"`undue influence on an officeholder's judgment'\" and from creating \"`the appearance of such influence,'\" beyond the sphere of <i>quid pro quo</i> relationships. <i>Id.,</i> at 150, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 143-144, 152-154, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Colorado II,</i> 533 U.S., at 441, 121 S.Ct. 2351; <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 389, 120 S.Ct. 897. Corruption can take many forms. Bribery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one's behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority's apparent belief that <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics. It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each other's backsand which amply supported Congress' determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis, Judge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the corrupting consequences of corporate and union independent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA's passage. See <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-560, 622-625; see also <i>id.,</i> at 804-805, 813, n. 143 (Leon, J.) (indicating agreement). As summarized in her own words:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members' elections. The record also indicates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*962</span> that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election-related advertisements. Indeed, Members of Congress are particularly grateful when negative issue advertisements are run by these organizations, leaving the candidates free to run positive advertisements and be seen as `above the fray.' Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate's behalf, when they are being run, and where they are being run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Findings also demonstrate that Members of Congress seek to have corporations and unions run these advertisements on their behalf. The Findings show that Members suggest that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups with the understanding that the money contributed to these groups will assist the Member in a campaign. After the election, these organizations often seek credit for their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 623-624 (citations and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\r\n<p>Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge Kollar-Kotelly seemed to have a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis, but other arrangements were more subtle. Her analysis shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of the <i>quid pro quo</i> category, as well as the adverse consequences that <i>all</i> such arrangements may have. There are threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society than the odd bribe. Yet the majority's understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but the most discrete abuses.</p>\r\n<p>Our \"undue influence\" cases have allowed the American people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, \"that officeholders will decide issues . . . on the merits or the desires of their constituencies,\" and not \"according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions\"or expenditures \"valued by the officeholder.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619.<sup>[63]</sup> When private interests are seen to exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account of the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns, the result can depart so thoroughly \"from what is pure or correct\" in the conduct of Government, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 512 (1966) (defining \"corruption\"), that it amounts to a \"subversion . . . of the electoral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*963</span> process,\" <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 575, 77 S.Ct. 529. At stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Government but also the public's faith therein, not only \"the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents [but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves,\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 507, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). \"Take away Congress' authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and `the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897).<sup>[64]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The cluster of interrelated interests threatened by such undue influence and its appearance has been well captured under the rubric of \"democratic integrity.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 522, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting). This value has underlined a century of state and federal efforts to regulate the role of corporations in the electoral process.<sup>[65]</sup></p>\r\n<p>Unlike the majority's myopic focus on <i>quid pro quo</i> scenarios and the free-floating \"First Amendment principles\" on which it rests so much weight, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, this broader understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation's history. \"During debates on the earliest [campaign finance] reform acts, the terms `corruption' and `undue influence' were used nearly interchangeably.\" Pasquale, Reclaiming Egalitarianism in the Political Theory of Campaign Finance Reform, 2008 U. Ill. L.Rev. 599, 601. Long before <i>Buckley,</i> we appreciated that \"[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard . . . an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\" <i>Burroughs v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102172\"><a href=\"/opinion/102172/burroughs-and-cannon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 545, 54 S.Ct. 287, 78 L.Ed. 484 (1934). And whereas we have no evidence to support the notion that the Framers would have wanted corporations to have the same rights as natural persons in the electoral context, we have ample evidence to suggest that they would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance. It is fair to say that \"[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*964</span> Teachout 348, which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests, see <i>id.,</i> at 373-374; see also <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 280, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). They discussed corruption \"more often in the Constitutional Convention than factions, violence, or instability.\" Teachout 352. When they brought our constitutional order into being, the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self-government that this Court has lost sight of.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Quid Pro Quo <i>Corruption</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>There is no need to take my side in the debate over the scope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court's merits holding is wrong. Even under the majority's \"crabbed view of corruption,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 152, 124 S.Ct. 619, the Government should not lose this case.</p>\r\n<p>\"The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption through the creation of political debts] has never been doubted.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 788, n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption interest most narrowly, we have never suggested that such <i>quid pro quo</i> debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct crimes. Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of, some outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder. See <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 143, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"We have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In <i>Buckley,</i> we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA's contribution limits, noting that such laws `deal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action'\" (quoting 424 U.S., at 28, 96 S.Ct. 612; alteration in original)). It has likewise never been doubted that \"[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 27, 96 S.Ct. 612. Congress may \"legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.</p>\r\n<p>In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied to BCRA § 203, however, they conclude \"[t]he anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 908.</p>\r\n<p>Although the Court suggests that <i>Buckley</i> compels its conclusion, <i>ante,</i> at 908-910, <i>Buckley</i> cannot sustain this reading. It is true that, in evaluating FECA's ceiling on independent expenditures by all persons, the <i>Buckley</i> Court found the governmental interest in preventing corruption \"inadequate.\" 424 U.S., at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612. But <i>Buckley</i> did not evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it rule out the possibility that a future Court might find otherwise. The opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering only express advocacy (<i>i.e.,</i> magic words) would likely be ineffectual, <i>ibid.,</i> a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that \"the independent advocacy restricted by [FECA § 608(e)(1)] <i>does not presently appear</i> to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions,\" <i>id.,</i> at 46, 96 S.Ct. 612 (emphasis added). <i>Buckley</i> expressly contemplated that an anticorruption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*965</span> rationale might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at a later date, \"because it may be that, in some circumstances, `large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements as do large contributions.'\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 478, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 45, 96 S.Ct. 612). Certainly <i>Buckley</i> did not foreclose this possibility with respect to electioneering communications made with corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had no occasion to consider.</p>\r\n<p>The <i>Austin</i> Court did not rest its holding on <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, as it found the broader corruption implicated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a sufficient basis for Michigan's restriction on corporate electioneering. 494 U.S., at 658-660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Concurring in that opinion, I took the position that \"the danger of either the fact, or the appearance, of <i>quid pro quo</i> relationships [also] provides an adequate justification for state regulation\" of these independent expenditures. <i>Id.,</i> at 678, 110 S.Ct. 1391. I did not see this position as inconsistent with <i>Buckley</i>'s analysis of individual expenditures. Corporations, as a class, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny; they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy access and votes. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1 trillion during the last election cycle). Business corporations must engage the political process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The unparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups) spend unrestricted sums on elections.</p>\r\n<p>It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now say that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corporations grew more and more adept at crafting \"issue ads\" to help or harm a particular candidate, these nominally independent expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very direct sense. The sponsors of these ads were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over; \"candidates and officials knew who their friends were,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 129, 124 S.Ct. 619. Many corporate independent expenditures, it seemed, had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. In an age in which money and television ads are the coin of the campaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influence over, public officials.</p>\r\n<p>The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA record does not contain \"direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted). It would have been quite remarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such behavior by its own Members. Proving that a specific vote was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been next to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motivations, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote. Yet, even if \"[i]ngratiation and access . . . are not corruption\" themselves, <i>ibid.,</i> they are necessary prerequisites to it; they can create both the opportunity for, and the appearance of, <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangements. The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*966</span> realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of <i>quid pro quo</i> deals: threats, both explicit and implicit. Starting today, corporations with large war chests to deploy on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their interests. The majority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record provides \"only scant evidence that independent expenditures. . . ingratiate,\" and that, \"in any event,\" none of it matters. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly documented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained its significance under the majority's own touchstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption rationale, <i>Buckley.</i> See <i>McConnell,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d, at 555-560, 622-625. Witnesses explained how political parties and candidates used corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA's \"hard-money\" limitations. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 478-479. One former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that \"`[c]andidates whose campaigns benefit from [phony \"issue ads\"] greatly appreciate the help of these groups. In fact, Members will also be favorably disposed to those who finance these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending legislation.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers). One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontroverted testimony, that \"`unregulated expenditureswhether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad campaignscan sometimes generate <i>far more</i> influence than direct campaign contributions.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting declaration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum, Judge Kollar-Kotelly found, \"[t]he record powerfully demonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with the general treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears those entities to elected officials in a way that could be perceived by the public as corrupting.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 622-623. She concluded that the Government's interest in preventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept was defined in <i>Buckley,</i> was itself sufficient to uphold BCRA § 203. 251 F.Supp.2d, at 622-625. Judge Leon agreed. See <i>id.,</i> at 804-805 (dissenting only with respect to the Wellstone Amendment's coverage of <i>MCFL</i> corporations).</p>\r\n<p>When the <i>McConnell</i> Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court regarding § 203, we did not rest our holding on a narrow notion of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. Instead we relied on the governmental interest in combating the unique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as recognized in <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales, 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (citing <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391), as well as the interest in preventing circumvention of contribution limits, 540 U.S., at 128-129, 205, 206, n. 88, 124 S.Ct. 619. Had we felt constrained by the view of today's Court that <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption and its appearance are the only interests that count in this field, <i>ante,</i> at 903-911, we of course would have looked closely at that issue. And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly reflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found one or both of those interests satisfied and § 203 appropriately tailored to them.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's rejection of the <i>Buckley</i> anticorruption rationale on the ground that independent corporate expenditures \"do not give rise to [<i>quid pro quo</i>] corruption or the appearance of corruption,\" <i>ante,</i> at 909, is thus unfair as well as unreasonable. Congress and outside experts have generated significant evidence corroborating this rationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the relevant materials before us is that the Government had no reason <span class=\"star-pagination\">*967</span> to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge the plaintiff had abandoned. The Court cannot both <i>sua sponte</i> choose to relitigate <i>McConnell</i> on appeal and then complain that the Government has failed to substantiate its case. If our colleagues were really serious about the interest in preventing <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption, they would remand to the District Court with instructions to commence evidentiary proceedings.<sup>[66]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The insight that even technically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions is bolstered by our decision last year in <i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> 556 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009). In that case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a corporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Virginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular candidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that court. \"In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin's campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to `And For The Sake Of The Kids,'\" a § 527 corporation that ran ads targeting Benjamin's opponent. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257. \"This was not all. Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures. . . `\"to support . . . Brent Benjamin.\"'\" <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257 (second alteration in original). Applying its common sense, this Court accepted petitioners' argument that Blankenship's \"pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias\" when Benjamin later declined to recuse himself from the appeal by Blankenship's corporation. <i>Id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2262. \"Though n[o] . . . bribe or criminal influence\" was involved, we recognized that \"Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias,\" we further noted, \"simply underscore the need for objective rules,\" <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2263rules which will perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its actual existence.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>Caperton,</i> then, we accepted the premise that, at least in some circumstances, independent expenditures on candidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption. Indeed, this premise struck the Court as so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship's spending on behalf of Benjaminspending that consisted of 99.97% independent expenditures ($3 million) and 0.03% direct contributions ($1,000)as a \"contribution.\" See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2257 (\"The basis for the [recusal] motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from\" Blankenship); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2258 (referencing \"Blankenship's $3 million in contributions\"); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2264 (\"Blankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace <span class=\"star-pagination\">*968</span> him with Benjamin\"); <i>id.,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 2264 (\"Blankenship's campaign contributions . . . had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome\"). The reason the Court so thoroughly conflated expenditures and contributions, one assumes, is that it realized that some expenditures may be functionally equivalent to contributions in the way they influence the outcome of a race, the way they are interpreted by the candidates and the public, and the way they taint the decisions that the officeholder thereafter takes.</p>\r\n<p><i>Caperton</i> is illuminating in several additional respects. It underscores the old insight that, on account of the extreme difficulty of proving corruption, \"prophylactic measures, reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in purpose or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard against corruption.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 30, 96 S.Ct. 612; see also <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 392, n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 897. It underscores that \"certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement\" may likewise be needed to \"hedge against circumvention of valid contribution limits.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 205, 124 S.Ct. 619 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also <i>Colorado II,</i> 533 U.S., at 456, 121 S.Ct. 2351 (\"[A]ll Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption\"). It underscores that for-profit corporations associated with electioneering communications will often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with \"misleading names,\" such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, \"to conceal their identity\" as the sponsor of those communications, thereby frustrating the utility of disclosure laws. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 128, 124 S.Ct. 619; see also <i>id.,</i> at 196-197, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>And it underscores that the consequences of today's holding will not be limited to the legislative or executive context. The majority of the States select their judges through popular elections. At a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, see, <i>e.g.,</i> O'Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov. 15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union general treasury spending in these races. Perhaps \"<i>Caperton</i> motions\" will catch some of the worst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Deference and Incumbent Self-Protection</i></h2>\r\n<p>Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch of Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorruption rationale without serious analysis.<sup>[67]</sup> Today's opinion provides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Congress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies have offered one: the incentives of the legislators who passed BCRA. Section 203, our colleagues have suggested, may be little more than \"an incumbency protection plan,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 306, 124 S.Ct. 619 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also <i>id.,</i> at 249-250, 260-263, 124 S.Ct. 619 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), a disreputable attempt at legislative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*969</span> self-dealing rather than an earnest effort to facilitate First Amendment values and safeguard the legitimacy of our political system. This possibility, the Court apparently believes, licenses it to run roughshod over Congress' handiwork.</p>\r\n<p>In my view, we should instead start by acknowledging that \"Congress surely has both wisdom and experience in these matters that is far superior to ours.\" <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118057\"><a href=\"/opinion/118057/colorado-republican-federal-campaign-comm-v-federa/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 650, 116 S.Ct. 2309, 135 L.Ed.2d 795 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Many of our campaign finance precedents explicitly and forcefully affirm the propriety of such presumptive deference. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 158, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 155-156, 123 S.Ct. 2200; <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 209-210, 103 S.Ct. 552. Moreover, \"[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchanged throughout a century of careful legislative adjustment.\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 162, n. 9, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 391, 120 S.Ct. 897 (\"The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised\"). In America, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern campaign finance, just like all other laws. To apply a level of scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating electioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self-interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p>This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if there were a solid basis for believing that a legislative action was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents or that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral process.<sup>[68]</sup> See <i>League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145627\"><a href=\"/opinion/145627/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 447, 126 S.Ct. 2594, 165 L.Ed.2d 609 (2006) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>Vieth v. Jubelirer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134735\"><a href=\"/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 317, 124 S.Ct. 1769, 158 L.Ed.2d 546 (2004) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Along with our duty to balance competing constitutional concerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elections remain at least minimally open, fair, and competitive. But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress' years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition. \"Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 31, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\r\n<p>We have no record evidence from which to conclude that BCRA § 203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the Court today calls into question, reflects or fosters such invidious discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that \"`<i>any</i> restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 249, 124 S.Ct. 619 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be turned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*970</span> § 203 might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents have pre-existing relationships with corporations and unions, and groups that wish to procure legislative benefits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting officeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits and is statistically likely to retain office. If a corporation's goal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corporation would do well to cultivate stable, long-term relationships of dependency.</p>\r\n<p>So we do not have a solid theoretical basis for condemning § 203 as a front for incumbent self-protection, and it seems equally if not more plausible that restrictions on corporate electioneering will be self-denying. Nor do we have a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court's failure to cite any empirical research attests. Nor does the legislative history give reason for concern. Congress devoted years of careful study to the issues underlying BCRA; \"[f]ew legislative proposals in recent years have received as much sustained public commentary or news coverage\"; \"[p]olitical scientists and academic experts . . . with no self-interest in incumbent protectio[n] were central figures in pressing the case for BCRA\"; and the legislation commanded bipartisan support from the outset. Pildes, The Supreme Court 2003 Term Foreword: The Constitutionalization of Democratic Politics, 118 Harv. L.Rev. 28, 137 (2004). Finally, it is important to remember just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were prior to BCRA's passage. As the Solicitor General aptly remarked at the time, \"the evidence supports overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under the old system just fine.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>McConnell v. FEC</i><i>,</i> O.T. 2003, No. 02-1674, p. 61. \"It would be hard to develop a scheme that could be better for incumbents.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, then, \"there is no convincing evidence that th[e] important interests favoring expenditure limits are fronts for incumbency protection.\" <i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S., at 279, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). \"In the meantime, a legislative judgment that `enough is enough' should command the greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a constitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect relationship to activity that affects the quantity . . . of repetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 279-280, 126 S.Ct. 2479. The majority cavalierly ignores Congress' factual findings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges the validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero. This is quite different from conscientious policing for impermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensitive First Amendment context. It is the denial of Congress' authority to regulate corporate spending on elections.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2><i>Austin and Corporate Expenditures</i></h2>\r\n<p>Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general societal interests at stake in campaign finance regulation, it also overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by the regulation of <i>corporate</i> expenditures. The majority fails to appreciate that <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale is itself an anticorruption rationale, see 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (describing \"a different type of corruption\"), tied to the special concerns raised by corporations. Understood properly, \"antidistortion\" is simply a variant on the classic governmental interest in protecting against improper influences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic process. It is manifestly not just an \"`equalizing'\" ideal in disguise. <i>Ante,</i> at 904 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S., at 48, 96 S.Ct. 612).<sup>[69]</sup></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>\r\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*971</span> 1. <i>Antidistortion</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>The fact that corporations are different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the majority opinion almost completely elides it. <i>Austin</i> set forth some of the basic differences. Unlike natural persons, corporations have \"limited liability\" for their owners and managers, \"perpetual life,\" separation of ownership and control, \"and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets . . . that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on their shareholders' investments.\" 494 U.S., at 658-659, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Unlike voters in U.S. elections, corporations may be foreign controlled.<sup>[70]</sup> Unlike other interest groups, business corporations have been \"effectively delegated responsibility for ensuring society's economic welfare\";<sup>[71]</sup> they inescapably structure the life of every citizen. \"`[T]he resources in the treasury of a business corporation,'\" furthermore, \"`are not an indication of popular support for the corporation's political ideas.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616). \"`They reflect instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.'\" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (quoting <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616).<sup>[72]</sup></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*972</span> It might also be added that corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their \"personhood\" often serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of \"We the People\" by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.</p>\r\n<p>These basic points help explain why corporate electioneering is not only more likely to impair compelling governmental interests, but also why restrictions on that electioneering are less likely to encroach upon First Amendment freedoms. One fundamental concern of the First Amendment is to \"protec[t] the individual's interest in self-expression.\" <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110311\"><a href=\"/opinion/110311/consolidated-edison-co-v-public-serv-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 534, n. 2, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); see also <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 777, n. 12, 98 S.Ct. 1407. Freedom of speech helps \"make men free to develop their faculties,\" <i>Whitney v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101097\"><a href=\"/opinion/101097/whitney-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 375, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), it respects their \"dignity and choice,\" <i>Cohen v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108360\"><a href=\"/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), and it facilitates the value of \"individual self-realization,\" Redish, The Value of Free Speech, 130 U. Pa. L.Rev. 591, 594 (1982). Corporate speech, however, is derivative speech, speech by proxy. A regulation such as BCRA § 203 may affect the way in which individuals disseminate certain messages through the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone from speaking in his or her own voice. \"Within the realm of [campaign spending] generally,\" corporate spending is \"furthest from the core of political expression.\" <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 161, n. 8, 123 S.Ct. 2200.</p>\r\n<p>It is an interesting question \"who\" is even speaking when a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political preferences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal ends. Some individuals associated with the corporation must make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby fostering their self-expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful. It is entirely possible that the corporation's electoral message will <i>conflict</i> with their personal convictions. Take away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of those ads, and no one's autonomy, dignity, or political equality has been impinged upon in the least.</p>\r\n<p>Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from individual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view that a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on individuals' electioneering expenditures in the service of the governmental interests explained above, and in recognition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct restraints on speech but rather on its financing. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Randall,</i> 548 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*973</span> U.S., at 273, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (dissenting opinion). But those restrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the primary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is involved. Some of those individuals might feel that they need to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particular candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral preferences. This is obviously not the situation with business corporations, as their routine practice of giving \"substantial sums to <i>both</i> major national parties\" makes pellucidly clear. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 148, 124 S.Ct. 619. \"[C]orporate participation\" in elections, any business executive will tell you, \"is more transactional than ideological.\" Supp. Brief for Committee for Economic Development as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.</p>\r\n<p>In this transactional spirit, some corporations have affirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their electioneering communications. These corporations fear that officeholders will shake them down for supportive ads, that they will have to spend increasing sums on elections in an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors, and that public trust in business will be eroded. See <i>id.,</i> at 10-19. A system that effectively forces corporations to use their shareholders' money both to maintain access to, and to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ultimately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corporations. It can impose a kind of implicit tax.<sup>[73]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In short, regulations such as § 203 and the statute upheld in <i>Austin</i> impose only a limited burden on First Amendment freedoms not only because they target a narrow subset of expenditures and leave untouched the broader \"public dialogue,\" <i>ante,</i> at 899, but also because they leave untouched the speech of natural persons. Recognizing the weakness of a speaker-based critique of <i>Austin,</i> the Court places primary emphasis not on the corporation's right to electioneer, but rather on the listener's interest in hearing what every possible speaker may have to say. The Court's central argument is that laws such as § 203 have \"`deprived [the electorate] of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 907 (quoting <i>CIO,</i> 335 U.S., at 144, 68 S.Ct. 1349 (Rutledge, J., concurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, \"interferes with the `open marketplace' of ideas protected by the First Amendment,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906 (quoting <i>New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145835\"><a href=\"/opinion/145835/new-york-state-bd-of-elections-v-lopez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 208, 128 S.Ct. 791, 169 L.Ed.2d 665 (2008)).</p>\r\n<p>There are many flaws in this argument. If the overriding concern depends on the interests of the audience, surely the public's perception of the value of corporate speech should be given important weight. That perception today is the same as it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*974</span> was a century ago when Theodore Roosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time, led to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign expenditures that is overruled today. See <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S., at 509-510, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President Roosevelt's remarks). The distinctive threat to democratic integrity posed by corporate domination of politics was recognized at \"the inception of the republic\" and \"has been a persistent theme in American political life\" ever since. Regan 302. It is only certain Members of this Court, not the listeners themselves, who have agitated for more corporate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p><i>Austin</i> recognized that there are substantial reasons why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general treasury expenditures will give corporations \"unfai[r] influence\" in the electoral process, 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391, and distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial resources on a scale few natural persons can match. The structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the corporation's economic interests and the political preferences of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral process with the aim \"to enhance the profitability of the company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a broader or conflicting set of priorities,\" Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11; see also ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations § 2.01(a), p. 55 (1992) (\"[A] corporation . . . should have as its objective the conduct of business activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit and shareholder gain\"). In a state election such as the one at issue in <i>Austin,</i> the interests of nonresident corporations may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of local voters. Consequently, when corporations grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can flood the market with advocacy that bears \"little or no correlation\" to the ideas of natural persons or to any broader notion of the public good, 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The opinions of real people may be marginalized. \"The expenditure restrictions of [2 U.S.C.] § 441b are thus meant to ensure that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas.\" <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 259, 107 S.Ct. 616.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorporate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon thereafter. Corporate \"domination\" of electioneering, <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, can generate the impression that corporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn on their televisions and radios before an election and hear only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy. A Government captured by corporate interests, they may come to believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor willing to give their views a fair hearing. The predictable result is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased perception that large spenders \"`call the tune'\" and a reduced \"`willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897). To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those races may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation. On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*975</span> might diminish the ability of citizens to \"hold officials accountable to the people,\" <i>ante,</i> at 898, and disserve the goal of a public debate that is \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\" <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature is entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored measures in response.</p>\r\n<p>The majority's unwillingness to distinguish between corporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possibility that corporations' \"war chests\" and their special \"advantages\" in the legal realm, <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, may translate into special advantages in the market for legislation. When large numbers of citizens have a common stake in a measure that is under consideration, it may be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on behalf of their position. The corporate form, by contrast, \"provides a simple way to channel rents to only those who have paid their dues, as it were. If you do not own stock, you do not benefit from the larger dividends or appreciation in the stock price caused by the passage of private interest legislation.\" Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech, Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate Charters, 69 U. Chi. L.Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corporations, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that favor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of money but because of their legal and organizational structure. Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and the door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is \"far more destructive\" than what noncorporations are capable of. <i>Ibid.</i> It is for reasons such as these that our campaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that \"the `differing structures and purposes' of different entities `may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process.'\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 210, 103 S.Ct. 552 (quoting <i>California Medical Assn.,</i> 453 U.S., at 201, 101 S.Ct. 2712).</p>\r\n<p>The Court's facile depiction of corporate electioneering assumes away all of these complexities. Our colleagues ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on \"nothing more\" than a fear that corporations have a special \"ability to persuade,\" <i>ante,</i> at 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.), as if corporations were our society's ablest debaters and viewpoint-neutral laws such as § 203 were created to suppress their best arguments. In their haste to knock down yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore the fundamental concerns of the <i>Austin</i> Court and the legislatures that have passed laws like § 203: to safeguard the integrity, competitiveness, and democratic responsiveness of the electoral process. All of the majority's theoretical arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experience, \"that there is no such thing as too much speech,\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 695, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).<sup>[74]</sup> If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority's premise would be sound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener's exposure to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*976</span> relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens' willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.</p>\r\n<p>None of this is to suggest that corporations can or should be denied an opportunity to participate in election campaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a work of art such as <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> may be banned), or to deny that some corporate speech may contribute significantly to public debate. What it shows, however, is that <i>Austin</i>'s \"concern about corporate domination of the political process,\" 494 U.S., at 659, 110 S.Ct. 1391, reflects more than a concern to protect governmental interests outside of the First Amendment. It also reflects a concern to <i>facilitate</i> First Amendment values by preserving some breathing room around the electoral \"marketplace\" of ideas, <i>ante,</i> at 896, 904, 906, 914, 915, the marketplace in which the actual people of this Nation determine how they will govern themselves. The majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as § 203 do not merely pit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First Amendment values against each other. There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any effort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers against the First Amendment rights of listeners. But when the speakers in question are not real people and when the appeal to \"First Amendment principles\" depends almost entirely on the listeners' perspective, <i>ante,</i> at 886, 912, it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actually be affected.</p>\r\n<p>In critiquing <i>Austin</i>'s antidistortion rationale and campaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues place tremendous weight on the example of media corporations. See <i>ante,</i> at 905-907, 911; <i>ante,</i> at 917, 923 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.); <i>ante,</i> at 927-928 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet it is not at all clear that <i>Austin</i> would permit § 203 to be applied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but also in facilitating public discourse; as the <i>Austin</i> Court explained, \"media corporations differ significantly from other corporations in that their resources are devoted to the collection of information and its dissemination to the public,\" 494 U.S., at 667, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Our colleagues have raised some interesting and difficult questions about Congress' authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and about how to define what constitutes the press. <i>But that is not the case before us.</i> Section 203 does not apply to media corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is not a media corporation. There would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media corporations if the majority did not, first, transform Citizens United's as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, second, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all \"identity\"-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news outlet exactly the same as General Motors.<sup>[75]</sup> This calls to mind George Berkeley's description of philosophers: \"[W]e have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.\" Principles of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, ¶ 3 (R. Woolhouse ed.1988).</p>\r\n<p>It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues feared that a campaign finance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*977</span> regulation such as § 203 may be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore attended carefully to the choices the Legislature has made. But the majority does not bother to consider such practical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply stipulates that \"enlightened self-government\" can arise only in the absence of regulation. <i>Ante,</i> at 898. In light of the distinctive features of corporations identified in <i>Austin,</i> there is no valid basis for this assumption. The marketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items or lawsare meant to be bought and sold, and when we move from the realm of economics to the realm of corporate electioneering, there may be no \"reason to think the market ordering is intrinsically good at all,\" Strauss 1386.</p>\r\n<p>The Court's blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well promote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the Amendment was meant to serve. It will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process. Americans may be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-government today.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>2. <i>Shareholder Protection</i>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>There is yet another way in which laws such as § 203 can serve First Amendment values. Interwoven with <i>Austin</i>'s concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not \"reflec[t] [their] support.\" 494 U.S., at 660-661, 110 S.Ct. 1391. When corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill. Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation's electoral message may find their financial investments being used to undermine their political convictions.</p>\r\n<p>The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that those who pay for an electioneering communication actually support its content and that managers do not use general treasuries to advance personal agendas. <i>Ibid.</i> It \"`allows corporate political participation without the temptation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 204, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163, 123 S.Ct. 2200). A rule that privileges the use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of dissenters. <i>Austin</i>'s acceptance of restrictions on general treasury spending \"simply allows people who have invested in the business corporation for purely economic reasons\"the vast majority of investors, one assumes\"to avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their economic objectives.\" Winkler, Beyond <i>Bellotti,</i> 32 Loyola (LA) L.Rev. 133, 201 (1998).</p>\r\n<p>The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and union members has a long history in campaign finance reform. It provided a central motivation for the Tillman Act in 1907 and subsequent legislation, see <i>Pipefitters v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108586\"><a href=\"/opinion/108586/pipefitters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 414-415, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972); Winkler, 92 Geo. L. J., at 887-900, and it has been endorsed in a long line of our cases, see, <i>e.g., McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 204-205, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 152-154, 123 S.Ct. 2200; <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 258, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552; <i>Pipefitters,</i> 407 U.S., at 414-416, 92 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*978</span> S.Ct. 2247; see also n. 60, <i>supra.</i> Indeed, we have unanimously recognized the governmental interest in \"protect[ing] the individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates from having that money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed.\" <i>NRWC,</i> 459 U.S., at 207-208, 103 S.Ct. 552.</p>\r\n<p>The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that abuses of shareholder money can be corrected \"through the procedures of corporate democracy,\" <i>ante,</i> at 911 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through Internet-based disclosures, <i>ante,</i> at 916.<sup>[76]</sup> I fail to understand how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union members, who will also be affected by today's ruling, and I fail to understand why the Court is so confident in these mechanisms. By \"corporate democracy,\" presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that \"these rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,\" given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule. Blair &amp; Stout 320; see also <i>id.,</i> at 298-315; Winkler, 32 Loyola (LA) L.Rev., at 165-166, 199-200. Modern technology may help make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but it is utopian to believe that it solves the problem. Most American households that own stock do so through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans, see Evans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. L.Rev. 1105 (2009), which makes it more difficult both to monitor and to alter particular holdings. Studies show that a majority of individual investors make no trades at all during a given year. <i>Id.,</i> at 1117. Moreover, if the corporation in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees the company's ads may not know whether they are being funded through the PAC or through the general treasury.</p>\r\n<p>If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been spending general treasury money on objectionable electioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only partial. The injury to the shareholders' expressive rights has already occurred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation's stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like. The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable contributions in ways that any particular shareholder might disapprove. But those expenditures do not implicate the selection of public officials, an area in which \"the interests of unwilling . . . corporate shareholders [in not being] forced to subsidize that speech\" \"are at their zenith.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S., at 677, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Brennan, J., concurring). And in any event, the question is whether shareholder protection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in the weeks before an election, not whether additional types of corporate communications <span class=\"star-pagination\">*979</span> might similarly be conditioned on voluntariness.</p>\r\n<p>Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection rationale, the <i>Austin</i> Court did not hold it out as an adequate and independent ground for sustaining the statute in question. Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the antidistortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the problem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if electioneering expenditures can advance the political views of some members of a corporation, they will often compromise the views of others. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 663, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (discussing risk that corporation's \"members may be . . . reluctant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with [its] political expression\"). Second, it provides an additional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the corporate form, for doubting that these \"expenditures reflect actual public support for the political ideas espoused,\" <i>id.,</i> at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391. The shareholder protection rationale, in other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on corporate electioneering can serve both speakers' and listeners' interests, as well as the anticorruption interest. And it supplies yet another reason why corporate expenditures merit less protection than individual expenditures.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>V</h2>\r\n<p>Today's decision is backwards in many senses. It elevates the majority's agenda over the litigants' submissions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitutional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over reality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that <i>Austin</i> must be overruled and that § 203 is facially unconstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the Court's lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding corruption and the appearance of corruption does not provide an adequate justification for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate elections relies on an incorrect description of that interest, along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of established facts and the considered judgments of state and federal legislatures over many decades.</p>\r\n<p>In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules. The majority's rejection of this principle \"elevate[s] corporations to a level of deference which has not been seen at least since the days when substantive due process was regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.\" <i>Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S., at 817, n. 13, 98 S.Ct. 1407 (White, J., dissenting). At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.</p>\r\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\r\n<p>Justice THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\r\n<p>I join all but Part IV of the Court's opinion.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*980</span> Political speech is entitled to robust protection under the First Amendment. Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been reconcilable with that protection. By striking down § 203, the Court takes an important first step toward restoring full constitutional protection to speech that is \"indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government.\" <i>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 265, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted). I dissent from Part IV of the Court's opinion, however, because the Court's constitutional analysis does not go far enough. The disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in BCRA §§ 201 and 311 are also unconstitutional. See <i>id.,</i> at 275-277, and n. 10, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>Congress may not abridge the \"right to anonymous speech\" based on the \"`simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 276, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>McIntyre v.

In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court misapprehends the import of \"recent events\" that some <i>amici</i> describe \"in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 916. The Court properly recognizes these events as \"cause for concern,\" <i>ibid.,</i> but fails to acknowledge their constitutional significance. In my view, <i>amici</i>'s submissions show why the Court's insistence on upholding §§ 201 and 311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated) as was its prior approval of § 203.</p>\r\n<p><i>Amici</i>'s examples relate principally to Proposition 8, a state ballot proposition that California voters narrowly passed in the 2008 general election. Proposition 8 amended California's constitution to provide that \"[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Cal. Const., Art. I, § 7.5. Any donor who gave more than $100 to any committee supporting or opposing Proposition 8 was required to disclose his full name, street address, occupation, employer's name (or business name, if self-employed), and the total amount of his contributions.<sup>[1]</sup> See Cal. Govt.Code Ann. § 84211(f) (West 2005). The California Secretary of State was then required to post this information on the Internet. See §§ 84600-84601; §§ 84602-84602.1 (West Supp.2010); §§ 84602.5-84604 (West 2005); § 85605 (West Supp.2010); §§ 84606-84609 (West 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this information and created Web sites with maps showing the locations of homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters. Many supporters (or their customers) suffered property damage, or threats of physical violence or death, as a result. They cited these incidents in a complaint they filed after the 2008 election, seeking to invalidate California's mandatory disclosure laws. Supporters recounted being told: \"Consider yourself lucky. If I had a gun I would have gunned you down along with each and every other supporter,\" or, \"we have plans for you and your friends.\" Complaint in <i>ProtectMarriage.comYes on 8 v. Bowen,</i> Case No. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*981</span> 2:09-cv-00058-MCE-DAD (ED Cal.), ¶ 31. Proposition 8 opponents also allegedly harassed the measure's supporters by defacing or damaging their property. <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 32. Two religious organizations supporting Proposition 8 reportedly received through the mail envelopes containing a white powdery substance. <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 33.</p>\r\n<p>Those accounts are consistent with media reports describing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director of the nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists complained to his employer. Lott &amp; Smith, Donor Disclosure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, p. A13. The director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because opponents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival. <i>Ibid.</i> And a woman who had managed her popular, family-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she gave $100, because \"throngs of [angry] protesters\" repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and \"shout[ed] `shame on you' at customers.\" Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1. The police even had to \"arriv[e] in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob\" at the restaurant. <i>Ibid.</i> Some supporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real estate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a group opposing Proposition 8 \"received a letter from the Prop. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his company's name if he didn't also donate to the `Yes on 8' campaign.\" Donor Disclosure, <i>supra,</i> at A13.</p>\r\n<p>The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed donor information to <i>pre-empt</i> citizens' exercise of their First Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential election, a \"newly formed nonprofit group ... plann[ed] to confront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions.\" Luo, Group Plans Campaign Against G.O.P. Donors, N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2008, p. A15. Its leader, \"who described his effort as `going for the jugular,'\" detailed the group's plan to send a \"warning letter ... alerting donors who might be considering giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential dangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate why this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements. But <i>amici</i> present evidence of yet another reason to do so  the threat of retaliation from <i>elected officials.</i> As <i>amici</i>'s submissions make clear, this threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition in California. For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent state attorney general reported that some members of the State's business community feared donating to his campaign because they did not want to cross the incumbent; in his words, \"`I go to so many people and hear the same thing: \"I sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but I can't afford to have my name on your records. He might come after me next.\"'\" Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism at the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11. The incumbent won reelection in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>My point is not to express any view on the merits of the political controversies I describe. Rather, it is to demonstrate  using real-world, recent examples  the fallacy in the Court's conclusion that \"[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements ... impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 914 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*982</span> course they do. Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and elected officials to implement political strategies <i>specifically calculated</i> to curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied challenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate those speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can \"show a reasonable probability that disclosure... will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 914 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court's opinion itself proves the irony in this compromise. In correctly explaining why it must address the facial constitutionality of § 203, see <i>ante,</i> at 888-897, the Court recognizes that \"[t]he First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to ... seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day,\" <i>ante,</i> at 889; that as-applied challenges to § 203 \"would require substantial litigation over an extended time\" and result in an \"interpretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 891; that \"a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling,\" <i>ante,</i> at 892; and that avoiding a facial challenge to § 203 \"would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect\" that § 203 causes, <i>ante,</i> at 894. This logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied challenges to §§ 201 and 311.</p>\r\n<p>Irony aside, the Court's promise that as-applied challenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assurance. Now more than ever, §§ 201 and 311 will chill protected speech because  as California voters can attest  \"the advent of the Internet\" enables \"prompt disclosure of expenditures,\" which \"provide[s]\" political opponents \"with the information needed\" to intimidate and retaliate against their foes. <i>Ante,</i> at 916. Thus, \"disclosure permits citizens ... to react to the speech of [their political opponents] in a proper\"  or undeniably <i>improper</i>  \"way\" long before a plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment that subjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined careers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and threatening warning letters as the price for engaging in \"core political speech, the `primary object of First Amendment protection.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 264, 124 S.Ct. 619 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting <i>Nixon v.

I used 1800 only because the dissent did. But in any case, it is surely fanciful to think that a consensus of hostility towards corporations was transformed into general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and 1796.</p>\r\n<p>[3]  \"[P]eople in 1800 identified corporations with franchised monopolies.\" L. Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed.1985) (hereinafter Friedman). \"The chief cause for the changed popular attitude towards business corporations that marked the opening of the nineteenth century was the elimination of their inherent monopolistic character. This was accomplished primarily by an extension of the principle of free incorporation under general laws.\" 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 2, p. 8 (rev. ed.2006).</p>\r\n<p>[4]  At times (though not always) the dissent seems to exclude such non-\"business corporations\" from its denial of free speech rights. See <i>post,</i> at 949-950. Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the rights of business corporations and the rights of non-business corporations is even more imaginative than finding a distinction between the rights of <i>all</i> corporations and the rights of other associations.</p>\r\n<p>[5]  The best the dissent can come up with is that \"[p]ostratification practice\" supports its reading of the First Amendment. <i>Post,</i> at 951, n. 56. For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White's statement (in dissent) that \"[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 819, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). The sole authority Justice White cited for this proposition, <i>id.,</i> at 819, n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1407, was a law-review note that made no such claim. To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing with the propriety of corporate political expenditures were \"few.\" Note, Corporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961). More specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by a Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana. <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 197. Of course even if the common law was \"generally interpreted\" to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires, that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that <i>were</i> authorized by a corporation's charter could constitutionally be suppressed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>As additional \"[p]ostratification practice,\" the dissent notes that the Court \"did not recognize <i>any</i> First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century.\" <i>Post,</i> at 951, n. 56. But it did that in <i>Grosjean v. American Press Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102601\"><a href=\"/opinion/102601/grosjean-v-american-press-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936), a case involving freedom of the presswhich the dissent acknowledges <i>did</i> cover corporations from the outset. The relative recency of that first case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence was slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until 1919, see <i>Schenck v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99296\"><a href=\"/opinion/99296/schenck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); we did not invalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see <i>Stromberg v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101741\"><a href=\"/opinion/101741/stromberg-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and a federal law until 1965, see <i>Lamont v.

It is passing strange to interpret the phrase \"the freedom of speech, or of the press\" to mean, not everyone's right to speak or publish, but rather everyone's right to speak or the institutional press's right to publish. No one thought that is what it meant. Patriot Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary contains, under the word \"press,\" the following entry:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"<i>Liberty of the press,</i> in civil policy, is the free right of publishing books, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unrestrained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and opinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious to morals or to the peace of the state.\" 2 American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).</p>\r\n<p>As the Court's opinion describes, <i>ante,</i> at 905-906, our jurisprudence agrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.</p>\r\n<p>\"The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets.... The press in its historical connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion.\" <i>Lovell v. City of Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102991\"><a href=\"/opinion/102991/lovell-v-city-of-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 452, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938).</p>\r\n<p>[7]  The dissent says that \"`speech'\" refers to oral communications of human beings, and since corporations are not human beings they cannot speak. <i>Post,</i> at 950, n. 55. This is sophistry. The authorized spokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of the human beings who have formed that associationjust as the spokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its members. The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to speak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no problem with a corporation's enjoying the freedom of the press.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The same footnote asserts that \"it has been `claimed that the notion of institutional speech ... did not exist in post-revolutionary America.'\" This is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the University of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the sole support for its statement a treatise dealing with government speech, M. Yudof, When Government Speaks 42-50 (1983). The cited pages of that treatise provide no support whatever for the statementunless, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the \"institutional speech\" referred to was speech by the subject of the law-review article, governmental institutions.</p>\r\n<p>The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a professor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L.Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent, in that it would accord free-speech protection to associations.</p>\r\n<p>[1]  Specifically, Part I, <i>infra,</i> at 931-938, addresses the procedural history of the case and the narrower grounds of decision the majority has bypassed. Part II, <i>infra,</i> at 938-942, addresses <i>stare decisis.</i> Part III, <i>infra,</i> at 942-961, addresses the Court's assumptions that BCRA \"bans\" corporate speech, that identity-based distinctions may not be drawn in the political realm, and that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were outliers in our First Amendment tradition. Part IV, <i>infra,</i> at 961-979, addresses the Court's treatment of the anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales for regulating corporate electioneering.</p>\r\n<p>[2]  See <i>Yee v.

That is true, in the narrow sense that the court observed the issue was foreclosed by <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). See 530 F.Supp.2d 274, 278 (D.D.C.2008) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Yet as explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its facial challenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) motion for summary judgment, App. 261a-262a, any question about statutory validity had dropped out of the case. That latter ruling by the District Court was the \"final decision\" from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under BCRA § 403(a)(3). As regards the lower court decision that has come before us, the claim that § 203 is facially unconstitutional was neither pressed nor passed upon in any form.</p>\r\n<p>[4]  Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its facial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it \"require[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial challenge.\" 1:07-cv-2240-RCL-RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar. 26, 2008). By reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the Court gives it a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which was deprived of the opportunity to gather and present information necessary to its rebuttal.</p>\r\n<p>[5]  In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how § 203 has been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the District Court the details of <i>Hillary</i>'s funding or its own finances. We likewise have no evidence of how § 203 and comparable state laws were expected to affect corporations and unions in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>It is true, as the majority points out, that the <i>McConnell</i> Court evaluated the facial validity of § 203 in light of an extensive record. See <i>ante,</i> at 893-894. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any event, the majority's argument for striking down § 203 depends on its contention that the statute has proved too \"chilling\" in practiceand in particular on the contention that the controlling opinion in <i>WRTL,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and \"breathing space\" to this area of law. See <i>ante,</i> at 892, 894-897. We have no record with which to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the burdens of complying with § 203, but we have no meaningful evidence to show how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>[6]  Our cases recognize a \"type of facial challenge in the First Amendment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad because a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional.\" <i>Washington State Grange v.

If our colleagues nonetheless concluded that § 203's fatal flaw is that it affects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for overbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissible, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.</p>\r\n<p>[7]  Also perplexing is the majority's attempt to pass blame to the Government for its litigating position. By \"hold[ing] out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from adopting that position,\" the majority says, the Government has caused \"added uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895. Our colleagues have apparently never heard of an alternative argument. Like every litigant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that, it would prefer to lose on a narrow ground. The fact that there are numerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the Government acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything about the propriety of a facial ruling.</p>\r\n<p>[8]  The majority's \"chilling\" argument is particularly inapposite with respect to 2 U.S.C. § 441b's longstanding restriction on the use of corporate general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was ever any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional equivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what counts as express advocacy since the \"magic words\" test of <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 44, n. 52, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Yet even though Citizens United's briefs never once mention § 441b's restriction on express advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate chilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that <i>Hillary</i> counts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to opine that this statutory provision is \"invalid\" as well. <i>Ante,</i> at 913.</p>\r\n<p>[9]  The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges does not have \"some automatic effect\" that mechanically controls the judicial task. <i>Ante,</i> at 893. I agree, but it does not follow that in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less invert it.</p>\r\n<p>[10]  Professor Fallon proposes an intricate answer to this question that the majority ignores. Fallon 1327-1359. It bears mention that our colleagues have previously cited Professor Fallon's article for the exact opposite point from the one they wish to make today. In <i>Gonzales v. Carhart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145744\"><a href=\"/opinion/145744/gonzales-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007), the Court explained that \"[i]t is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop,\" and \"[f]or this reason, `[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 168, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (opinion for the Court by KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Fallon 1328 (second alteration in original)).</p>\r\n<p>[11]  Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to nonprofit organizations \"operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, ... the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.\"</p>\r\n<p>[12]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE is therefore much too quick when he suggests that, \"[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens Unitedbecause corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rightswould mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 919 (concurring opinion). That conclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens United's plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implausible position that <i>all</i> corporations and <i>all</i> types of expenditures enjoy the same First Amendment protections, which <i>always</i> trump the interests in regulation. At times, the majority appears to endorse this extreme view. At other times, however, it appears to suggest that nonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protection than for-profit corporations, see <i>ante,</i> at 897, 907, \"advocacy\" organizations have a better claim than other nonprofits, <i>ante,</i> at 897, domestic corporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 911-912, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations, <i>ante,</i> at 906-908, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast communications, <i>ante,</i> at 904. The majority never uses a multinational business corporation in its hypotheticals.</p>\r\n<p>[13]  The Court entirely ignores this statutory argument. It concludes that § 203 applies to <i>Hillary</i> on the basis of the film's content, <i>ante,</i> at 889-890, without considering the possibility that § 203 does not apply to video-on-demand transmissions generally.</p>\r\n<p>[14]  See <i>Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169649\"><a href=\"/opinion/169649/colorado-right-to-life-committee-inc-v-coffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span>, 1148 (C.A.10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that \"every other circuit to have addressed this issue\" has done likewise); Brief for Independent Sector as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10-11 (collecting cases). The Court rejects this solution in part because the Government \"merely suggest[s] it\" and \"does not say that it agrees with the interpretation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892. Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing insufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same time that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly abandoned. The Court also protests that a <i>de minimis</i> standard would \"requir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 892. But <i>de minimis</i> tests need not be intricate at all. A test that granted <i>MCFL</i> status to § 501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed dollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such donations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets, would be perfectly easy to understand and administer.</p>\r\n<p>[15]  Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have been to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA § 203(c), allowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering communications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace the payments to individual contributions. See Brief for National Rifle Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 5-15 (arguing forcefully that Congress intended this result).</p>\r\n<p>[16]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds our discussion of these narrower solutions \"quite perplexing\" because we suggest that the Court should \"latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question,\" without doing the same ourselves. <i>Ante,</i> at 918-919. There is nothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly situated to our colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view of the First Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not lead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this case, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional avoidance or to vindicate Citizens United's as-applied challenge. Each of the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statutory argument the Court accepted in last year's Voting Rights Act case, <i>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009).</p>\r\n<p>[17]  I will have more to say shortly about the meritsabout why <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and why their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present purposes, I limit the discussion to <i>stare-decisis</i>-specific considerations.</p>\r\n<p>[18]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that <i>Austin</i> has been undermined by subsequent dissenting opinions. <i>Ante,</i> at 934. Under this view, it appears that the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of requests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. THE CHIEF JUSTICE further suggests that <i>Austin</i> \"is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court's decisions even outside\" its particular facts, as when we applied its reasoning in <i>McConnell. Ante,</i> at 922. Once again, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the more we call it into question. For those who believe <i>Austin</i> was correctly decidedas the Federal Government and the States have long believed, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since <i>Austin</i> have believed, and as we continue to believethere is nothing \"destabilizing\" about the prospect of its continued application. It is gutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does today, that will be destabilizing.</p>\r\n<p>[19]  Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging the historical account of campaign finance law given in <i>United States v. Automobile Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105465\"><a href=\"/opinion/105465/united-states-v-automobile-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957). <i>Ante,</i> at 912. <i>Austin</i> did not so much as allude to this historical account, much less rely on it. Even if the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign finance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than <i>Automobile Workers</i> suggested, the point remains that this body of law has played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political life for decades upon decades.</p>\r\n<p>[20]  See Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5-13; see also Supp. Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1a-8a (listing 24 States that presently limit or prohibit independent electioneering expenditures from corporate general treasuries).</p>\r\n<p>[21]  Magleby, The Importance of the Record in <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 3 Election L. J. 285 (2004).</p>\r\n<p>[22]  To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the imbalance by removing BCRA's soft-money limits. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of KENNEDY, J.). But this is no response to any legislature that takes campaign finance regulation seriously. It merely illustrates the breadth of the majority's deregulatory vision.</p>\r\n<p>[23]  See Brief for Committee for Economic Development as <i>Amicus Curiae;</i> Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as <i>Amicus Curiae.</i> But see Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>Amicus Curiae.</i></p>\r\n<p>[24]  See Brief for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3, 9.</p>\r\n<p>[25]  See Brief for Independent Sector as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-20.</p>\r\n<p>[26]  See Brief for State of Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae.</i></p>\r\n<p>[27]  The FEC established this process following the Court's June 2007 decision in that case, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329. In the brief interval between the establishment of this process and the 2008 election, corporations and unions used it to make $108.5 million in electioneering communications. Supp. Brief for Appellee 22-23; FEC, Electioneering Communication Summary, online at http://fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ ECSummary.shtml (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\r\n<p>[28]  Concededly, <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were constitutional decisions, and we have often said that \"claims of <i>stare decisis</i> are at the weakest in that field, where our mistakes cannot be corrected by Congress.\" <i>Vieth v. Jubelirer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134735\"><a href=\"/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 305, 124 S.Ct. 1769, 158 L.Ed.2d 546 (2004) (plurality opinion). As a general matter, this principle is a sound one. But the principle only takes on real force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal democratic process; it is the fear of making \"mistakes [that] cannot be corrected by Congress,\" <i>ibid.,</i> that motivates us to review constitutional precedents with a more critical eye. <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> did not obstruct state or congressional legislative power in any way. Although it is unclear how high a bar today's decision will pose to future attempts to regulate corporate electioneering, it will clearly restrain much legislative action.</p>\r\n<p>[29]  See FEC, Number of Federal PAC's Increases, http://fec.gov/press/ press2008/20080812paccount.shtml.</p>\r\n<p>[30]  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 16 (citing FEC statistics placing this figure at $840 million). The majority finds the PAC option inadequate in part because \"[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 897. The formal \"separateness\" of PACs from their host corporationswhich administer and control the PACs but which cannot funnel general treasury funds into them or force members to support themis, of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>[31]  Roaming far afield from the case at hand, the majority worries that the Government will use § 203 to ban books, pamphlets, and blogs. <i>Ante,</i> at 896, 904, 912-913. Yet by its plain terms, § 203 does not apply to printed material. See 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i); see also 11 CFR § 100.29(c)(1) (\"[E]lectioneering communication does not include communications appearing in print media\"). And in light of the ordinary understanding of the terms \"broadcast, cable, [and] satellite,\" § 434(f)(3)(A)(i), coupled with Congress' clear aim of targeting \"a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619, we highly doubt that § 203 could be interpreted to apply to a Web site or book that happens to be transmitted at some stage over airwaves or cable lines, or that the FEC would ever try to do so. See 11 CFR § 100.26 (exempting most Internet communications from regulation as advertising); § 100.155 (exempting uncompensated Internet activity from regulation as an expenditure); Supp. Brief for Center for Independent Media et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 14 (explaining that \"the FEC has consistently construed [BCRA's] media exemption to apply to a variety of non-traditional media\"). If it should, the Government acknowledges \"there would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>[32]  As the Government points out, with a media corporation there is also a lesser risk that investors will not understand, learn about, or support the advocacy messages that the corporation disseminates. Supp. Reply Brief for Appellee 10. Everyone knows and expects that media outlets may seek to influence elections in this way.</p>\r\n<p>[33]  2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i).</p>\r\n<p>[34]  § 434(f)(3)(C).</p>\r\n<p>[35]  § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(II).</p>\r\n<p>[36]  § 441b(b); <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 211, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\r\n<p>[37]  § 441b(b)(2)(C).</p>\r\n<p>[38]  <i>WRTL,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>[39]  It is likewise nonsense to suggest that the FEC's \"`business is to censor.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 896 (quoting <i>Freedman v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106987\"><a href=\"/opinion/106987/freedman-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965)). The FEC's business is to administer and enforce the campaign finance laws. The regulatory body at issue in <i>Freedman</i> was a state <i>Board of Censors</i> that had virtually unfettered discretion to bar distribution of motion picture films it deemed not to be \"moral and proper.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 52-53, and n. 2, 85 S.Ct. 734. No movie could be shown in the State of Maryland that was not first approved and licensed by the Board of Censors. <i>Id.,</i> at 52, n. 1, 85 S.Ct. 734. It is an understatement to say that <i>Freedman</i> is not on point, and the majority's characterization of the FEC is deeply disconcerting.</p>\r\n<p>[40]  Citizens United has administered this PAC for over a decade. See Defendant FEC's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction in No. 07-2240 (ARR, RCL, RWR) (DC), p. 20.

The majority's creative suggestion that these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite implausible. In any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case, as Congress and half the state legislatures have concluded, over many decades, that their core functions of administering elections and passing legislation cannot operate effectively without some narrow restrictions on corporate electioneering paid for by general treasury funds.</p>\r\n<p>[47]  Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity and incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his speech. See Aristotle, Poetics 43-44 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (\"In evaluating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just the moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the identity of the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and the motive\"). The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper subject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer and disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.</p>\r\n<p>[48]  I dissented in <i>Forbes</i> because the broadcaster's decision to exclude the respondent from its debate was done \"on the basis of entirely subjective, ad hoc judgments,\" 523 U.S., at 690, 118 S.Ct. 1633, that suggested anticompetitive viewpoint discrimination, <i>id.,</i> at 693-694, 118 S.Ct. 1633, and lacked a compelling justification. Needless to say, my concerns do not apply to the instant case.</p>\r\n<p>[49]  The law at issue in <i>Burson</i> was far from unusual. \"[A]ll 50 States,\" the Court observed, \"limit access to the areas in or around polling places.\" 504 U.S., at 206, 112 S.Ct. 1846; see also Note, 91 Ky. L. J. 715, 729, n. 89, 747-769 (2003) (collecting statutes). I dissented in <i>Burson</i> because the evidence adduced to justify Tennessee's law was \"exceptionally thin,\" 504 U.S., at 219, 112 S.Ct. 1846, and \"the reason for [the] restriction [had] disappear[ed]\" over time, <i>id.,</i> at 223, 112 S.Ct. 1846. \"In short,\" I concluded, \"Tennessee ha[d] failed to point to any legitimate interest that would justify its selective regulation of campaign-related expression.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 225, 112 S.Ct. 1846. These criticisms are inapplicable to the case before us.</p>\r\n<p>[50]  They are likewise entitled to regulate media corporations differently from other corporations \"to ensure that the law `does not hinder or prevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing editorials about, newsworthy events.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 208, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Austin v.

Such measures have been a part of U.S. campaign finance law for many years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers, whose \"obsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country.\" Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.Rev. 341, 393, n. 245 (2009) (hereinafter Teachout); see also U.S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (\"[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust ... shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\"). Professor Teachout observes that a corporation might be analogized to a foreign power in this respect, \"inasmuch as its legal loyalties necessarily exclude patriotism.\" Teachout 393, n. 245.</p>\r\n<p>[52]  See A.

See E. Dodd, American Business Corporations Until 1860, p. 197 (1954); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 188-189 (2d ed. 1985); Baldwin, American Business Corporations Before 1789, 8 Am. Hist. Rev. 449, 450-459 (1903). Justice SCALIA quibbles with these figures; whereas we say that \"a few hundred\" charters were issued to business corporations during the 18th century, he says that the number is \"approximately 335.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 925 (concurring opinion). Justice SCALIA also raises the more serious point that it is improper to assess these figures by today's standards, <i>ante,</i> at 926, though I believe he fails to substantiate his claim that \"the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life\" by the century's end, <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). His formulation of that claim is also misleading, because the relevant reference point is not 1800 but the date of the First Amendment's ratification, in 1791. And at that time, the number of business charters must have been significantly smaller than 335, because the pace of chartering only began to pick up steam in the last decade of the 18th century. More than half of the century's total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800. Friedman, History of American Law, at 189.</p>\r\n<p>[54]  See Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Tom Logan (Nov. 12, 1816), in 12 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 42, 44 (P. Ford ed. 1905) (\"I hope we shall ... crush in [its] birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country\").</p>\r\n<p>[55]  In normal usage then, as now, the term \"speech\" referred to oral communications by individuals. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language 1853-1854 (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978) (listing as primary definition of \"speech\": \"The power of articulate utterance; the power of expressing thoughts by vocal words\"); 2 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970) (listing as primary definition of \"speech\": \"The faculty of uttering articulate sounds or words, as in human beings; the faculty of expressing thoughts by words or articulate sounds. <i>Speech</i> was given to man by his Creator for the noblest purposes\"). Indeed, it has been \"claimed that the notion of institutional speech ... did not exist in post-revolutionary America.\" Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006); see also Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995) (\"In the intellectual heritage of the eighteenth century, the idea that free speech was individual and personal was deeply rooted and clearly manifest in the writings of Locke, Milton, and others on whom the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights drew\"). Given that corporations were conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical capacity to \"speak,\" the burden of establishing that the Framers and ratifiers understood \"the freedom of speech\" to encompass corporate speech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p>[56]  Postratification practice bolsters the conclusion that the First Amendment, \"as originally understood,\" <i>ante,</i> at 906, did not give corporations political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals. Well into the modern era of general incorporation statutes, \"[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 819, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (White, J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize <i>any</i> First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century, see <i>ante,</i> at 899-900 (listing cases).</p>\r\n<p>[57]  In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against Justice SCALIA, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctionsexplicit distinctionsbetween types of \"speakers,\" or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court's strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers' views on the press, see <i>ante,</i> at 906-907; <i>ante,</i> at 926-928 (SCALIA, J., concurring), yet while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of \"identity\"-based distinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that much, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.</p>\r\n<p>[58]  Cf. L. Levy, Legacy of Suppression: Freedom of Speech and Press in Early American History 4 (1960) (\"The meaning of no other clause of the Bill of Rights at the time of its framing and ratification has been so obscure to us\" as the Free Speech and Press Clause).</p>\r\n<p>[59]  As the majority notes, there is some academic debate about the precise origins of these developments. <i>Ante,</i> at 912; see also n. 19, <i>supra.</i> There is <i>always</i> some academic debate about such developments; the motives of legislatures are never entirely clear or unitary. Yet the basic shape and trajectory of 20th-century campaign finance reform are clear, and one need not take a naïve or triumphalist view of this history to find it highly relevant. The Court's skepticism does nothing to mitigate the absurdity of its claim that <i>Austin</i> and <i>McConnell</i> were outliers. Nor does it alter the fact that five Justices today destroy a longstanding American practice.</p>\r\n<p>[60]  See <i>Pipefitters v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108586\"><a href=\"/opinion/108586/pipefitters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 409, 414-415, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972) (reading the statutory bar on corporate and union campaign spending not to apply to \"the voluntary donations of employees,\" when maintained in a separate account, because \"[t]he dominant [legislative] concern in requiring that contributions be voluntary was, after all, to protect the dissenting stockholder or union member\"); <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 592, 77 S.Ct. 529 (advising the District Court to consider on remand whether the broadcast in question was \"paid for out of the general dues of the union membership or [whether] the funds [could] be fairly said to have obtained on a voluntary basis\"); <i>United States v.

Both the <i>Pipefitters</i> and the <i>Automobile Workers</i> Court approvingly referenced Congress' goal of reducing \"the effect of aggregated wealth on federal elections,\" understood as wealth drawn from a corporate or union general treasury without the stockholders' or members' \"free and knowing choice.\" <i>Pipefitters,</i> 407 U.S., at 416, 92 S.Ct. 2247; see <i>Automobile Workers,</i> 352 U.S., at 582, 77 S.Ct. 529.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The two dissenters in <i>Pipefitters</i> would not have read the statutory provision in question, a successor to § 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, to allow such robust use of corporate and union funds to finance otherwise prohibited electioneering. \"This opening of the door to extensive corporate and union influence on the elective and legislative processes,\" Justice Powell wrote, \"must be viewed with genuine concern. This seems to me to be a regressive step as contrasted with the numerous legislative and judicial actions in recent years designed to assure that elections are indeed free and representative.\" 407 U.S., at 450, 92 S.Ct. 2247 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J.).</p>\r\n<p>[61]  Specifically, these corporations had to meet three conditions. First, they had to be formed \"for the express purpose of promoting political ideas,\" so that their resources reflected political support rather than commercial success. <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S., at 264, 107 S.Ct. 616. Next, they had to have no shareholders, so that \"persons connected with the organization will have no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Finally, they could not be \"established by a business corporation or a labor union,\" nor \"accept contributions from such entities,\" lest they \"serv[e] as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\r\n<p>[62]  According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, we are \"erroneou[s]\" in claiming that <i>McConnell</i> and <i>Beaumont</i> \"`reaffirmed'\" <i>Austin. Ante,</i> at 919-920. In both cases, the Court explicitly relied on <i>Austin</i> and quoted from it at length. See 540 U.S., at 204-205, 124 S.Ct. 619, 539 U.S., at 153-155, 158, 160, 163, 123 S.Ct. 2200; see also <i>ante,</i> at 893-894 (\"The holding and validity of <i>Austin</i> were essential to the reasoning of the <i>McConnell</i> majority opinion\"); Brief for Appellants National Rifle Association et al., O.T. 2003, No. 02-1675, p. 21 (\"<i>Beaumont</i> reaffirmed . . . the <i>Austin</i> rationale for restricting expenditures\"). The <i>McConnell</i> Court did so in the teeth of vigorous protests by Justices in today's majority that <i>Austin</i> should be overruled. See <i>ante,</i> at 893-894 (citing relevant passages); see also <i>Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S., at 163-164, 123 S.Ct. 2200 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Both Courts also heard criticisms of <i>Austin</i> from parties or <i>amici.</i> See Brief for Appellants Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al., O.T.2003, No. 02-1756, p. 35, n. 22; Reply Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch McConnell et al., O.T. 2003, No. 02-1674, pp. 13-14; Brief for Pacific Legal Foundation as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in <i>FEC v. Beaumont</i><i>,</i> O.T. 2002, No. 02-403, <i>passim.</i> If this does not qualify as reaffirmation of a precedent, then I do not know what would.</p>\r\n<p>[63]  Cf. <i>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118335\"><a href=\"/opinion/118335/nixon-v-shrink-missouri-government-pac/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 389, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (recognizing \"the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors\"). Though discrete in scope, these experiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a chance at functioning effectively and preserving the public's trust. \"Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S., at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619. There should be nothing controversial about the proposition that the influence being targeted is \"undue.\" In a democracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim of placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the benefactor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its arguments are seen as especially persuasive.</p>\r\n<p>[64]  The majority declares by fiat that the appearance of undue influence by high-spending corporations \"will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 910. The electorate itself has consistently indicated otherwise, both in opinion polls, see <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 176, 557-558, 623-624 (D.D.C.2003) (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.), and in the laws its representatives have passed, and our colleagues have no basis for elevating their own optimism into a tenet of constitutional law.</p>\r\n<p>[65]  Quite distinct from the interest in preventing improper influences on the electoral process, I have long believed that \"a number of [other] purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign.\" <i>Davis v. FEC,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2779, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). In my judgment, such limitations may be justified to the extent they are tailored to \"improving the quality of the exposition of ideas\" that voters receive, <i>ibid.,</i> \"free[ing] candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted), and \"protect[ing] equal access to the political arena,\" <i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145630\"><a href=\"/opinion/145630/randall-v-sorrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 278, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). I continue to adhere to these beliefs, but they have not been briefed by the parties or <i>amici</i> in this case, and their soundness is immaterial to its proper disposition.</p>\r\n<p>[66]  In fact, the notion that the \"electioneering communications\" covered by § 203 can breed <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption or the appearance of such corruption has only become more plausible since we decided <i>McConnell.</i> Recall that THE CHIEF JUSTICE's controlling opinion in <i>WRTL</i> subsequently limited BCRA's definition of \"electioneering communications\" to those that are \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\" 551 U.S., at 470, 127 S.Ct. 2652. The upshot was that after <i>WRTL,</i> a corporate or union expenditure could be regulated under § 203 only if everyone would understand it as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office. It does not take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy might be especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.</p>\r\n<p>[67]  \"We must give weight\" and \"due deference\" to Congress' efforts to dispel corruption, the Court states at one point. <i>Ante,</i> at 911. It is unclear to me what these maxims mean, but as applied by the Court they clearly do not entail \"deference\" in any normal sense of that term.</p>\r\n<p>[68]  Justice BREYER has suggested that we strike the balance as follows: \"We should defer to [the legislature's] political judgment that unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process. But we should not defer in respect to whether its solution . . . insulates legislators from effective electoral challenge.\" <i>Shrink Missouri,</i> 528 U.S., at 403-404, 120 S.Ct. 897 (concurring opinion).</p>\r\n<p>[69]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE denies this, <i>ante,</i> at 921-923, citing scholarship that has interpreted <i>Austin</i> to endorse an equality rationale, along with an article by Justice Thurgood Marshall's former law clerk that states that Marshall, the author of <i>Austin,</i> accepted \"equality of opportunity\" and \"equalizing access to the political process\" as bases for campaign finance regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall's Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 667-668 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is fair to say that <i>Austin</i> can bear an egalitarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this characterization of Justice Marshall's beliefs. But the fact that <i>Austin</i> can be read a certain way hardly proves THE CHIEF JUSTICE's charge that there is nothing more to it. Many of our precedents can bear multiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some \"equalizing\" implications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our takings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure. More important, the <i>Austin</i> Court expressly declined to rely on a speech-equalization rationale, see 494 U.S., at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391, and we have never understood <i>Austin</i> to stand for such a rationale. Whatever his personal views, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests he did; indeed, he \"would have viewed it as irresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale based on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would have even considered joining,\" Garrett, 52 Howard L. J., at 674.</p>\r\n<p>[70]  In state elections, even domestic corporations may be \"foreign\"-controlled in the sense that they are incorporated in another jurisdiction and primarily owned and operated by out-of-state residents.</p>\r\n<p>[71]  Regan, Corporate Speech and Civic Virtue, in Debating Democracy's Discontent 289, 302 (A. Allen &amp; M. Regan eds. 1998) (hereinafter Regan).</p>\r\n<p>[72]  Nothing in this analysis turns on whether the corporation is conceptualized as a grantee of a state concession, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85282\"><a href=\"/opinion/85282/dartmouth-college-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 636, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Marshall, C. J.), a nexus of explicit and implicit contracts, see, <i>e.g.,</i> F. Easterbrook &amp; D. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 12 (1991), a mediated hierarchy of stakeholders, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Blair &amp; Stout, A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law, 85 Va. L. Rev. 247 (1999) (hereinafter Blair &amp; Stout), or any other recognized model. <i>Austin</i> referred to the structure and the advantages of corporations as \"state-conferred\" in several places, 494 U.S., at 660, 665, 667, 110 S.Ct. 1391, but its antidistortion argument relied only on the basic descriptive features of corporations, as sketched above. It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the corporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in fundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to regulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its concern. Cf. Hansmann &amp; Kraakman 441, n. 5.</p>\r\n<p>[73]  Not all corporations support BCRA § 203, of course, and not all corporations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts. Some nonprofit corporations are created for an ideological purpose. Some closely held corporations are strongly identified with a particular owner or founder. The fact that § 203, like the statute at issue in <i>Austin,</i> regulates some of these corporations' expenditures does not disturb the analysis above. See 494 U.S., at 661-665, 110 S.Ct. 1391. Small-business owners may speak in their own names, rather than the business', if they wish to evade § 203 altogether. Nonprofit corporations that want to make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they refuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to disassociate without economic penalty. See <i>MCFL,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-fo/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 264, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986). Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a concern about BCRA's coverage of nonprofits that have ideological missions but lack <i>MCFL</i> status, our colleagues refuse to apply the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment or the lower courts' <i>de minimis</i> exception to <i>MCFL.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 891-892.</p>\r\n<p>[74]  Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, classroom, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.</p>\r\n<p>[75]  Under the majority's view, the legislature is thus damned if it does and damned if it doesn't. If the legislature gives media corporations an exemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corporations, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against identity-based distinctions. If the legislature does not give media corporations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of the press. The only way out of this invented bind: no regulations whatsoever.</p>\r\n<p>[76]  I note that, among the many other regulatory possibilities it has left open, ranging from new versions of § 203 supported by additional evidence of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption or its appearance to any number of tax incentive or public financing schemes, today's decision does not require that a legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect shareholders. Legislatures remain free in their incorporation and tax laws to condition the types of activity in which corporations may engage, including electioneering activity, on specific disclosure requirements or on prior express approval by shareholders or members.</p>\r\n<p>[1]  BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(2)(F) (\"Every person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any calendar year\" must disclose \"the names and addresses of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making the disbursement\").</p>\r\n<p>[2]  But cf. <i>Hill v.

S. C.\r\n  §441b. An electioneering communication is “any broadcast, cable, or\r\n  satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate\r\n  for Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary election,\r\n  §434(f)(3)(A), and that is “publicly distributed,” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2),\r\n  which in “the case of a candidate for nomination for President . . .\r\n  means” that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more\r\n  persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within\r\n  30 days,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions may establish a\r\n  political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneer\r\n  ing communications purposes. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2). In McConnell\r\n  v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 203–209, this Court upheld\r\n  limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying\r\n  on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494\r\n  U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s\r\n  corporate identity.\r\n     In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corpora\r\n  tion, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of then-\r\n  Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party’s Presidential\r\n  nomination. Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on\r\n  cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary\r\n  elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast\r\n2        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    and cable television. Concerned about possible civil and criminal\r\n    penalties for violating §441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive re\r\n    lief, arguing that (1) §441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary;\r\n    and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements,\r\n    BCRA §§201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to Hillary\r\n    and the ads. The District Court denied Citizens United a prelimi\r\n    nary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission\r\n    (FEC) summary judgment.\r\nHeld:\r\n    1. Because the question whether §441b applies to Hillary cannot be\r\n resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech,\r\n this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppres\r\n sion upheld in Austin. Pp. 5–20.\r\n       (a) Citizen United’s narrower arguments—that Hillary is not an\r\n “electioneering communication” covered by §441b because it is not\r\n “publicly distributed” under 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2); that §441b may\r\n not be applied to Hillary under Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin\r\n Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (WRTL), which found §441b uncon\r\n stitutional as applied to speech that was not “express advocacy or its\r\n functional equivalent,” id., at 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), deter\r\n mining that a communication “is the functional equivalent of express\r\n advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation\r\n other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,”\r\n id., at 469–470; that §441b should be invalidated as applied to movies\r\n shown through video-on-demand because this delivery system has a\r\n lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads;\r\n and that there should be an exception to §441b’s ban for nonprofit\r\n corporate political speech funded overwhelming by individuals—are\r\n not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. Pp. 5–12.\r\n       (b) Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground\r\n without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the First\r\n Amendment’s meaning and purpose. Citizens United did not waive\r\n this challenge to Austin when it stipulated to dismissing the facial\r\n challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived,\r\n this Court may reconsider Austin and §441b’s facial validity here be\r\n cause the District Court “passed upon” the issue, Lebron v. National\r\n Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379; (2) throughout\r\n the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has\r\n violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into\r\n a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies nec\r\n essary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Because Citizen\r\n United’s narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in\r\n an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider §441b’s facial valid\r\n ity. Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide\r\n                   Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nchilling effect caused by §441b’s corporate expenditure ban. This\r\nconclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty\r\ncaused by the Government’s litigating position; (2) substantial time\r\nwould be required to clarify §441b’s application on the points raised\r\nby the Government’s position in order to avoid any chilling effect\r\ncaused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is\r\nof primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any\r\nspeech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating po\r\nlitical speech is chilled. The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a\r\nprior restraint in the strict sense. However, given its complexity and\r\nthe deference courts show to administrative determinations, a\r\nspeaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy\r\ncosts of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmen\r\ntal agency for prior permission to speak. The restrictions thus func\r\ntion as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power\r\nanalogous to the type of government practices that the First Amend\r\nment was drawn to prohibit. The ongoing chill on speech makes it\r\nnecessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills\r\nspeech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has\r\nbeen demonstrated. Pp. 12–20.\r\n   2. Austin is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the\r\nGovernment to limit corporate independent expenditures. Hence,\r\n§441b’s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be\r\napplied to Hillary. Given this conclusion, the part of McConnell that\r\nupheld BCRA §203’s extension of §441b’s restrictions on independent\r\ncorporate expenditures is also overruled. Pp. 20–51.\r\n      (a) Although the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall\r\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech,” §441b’s prohibition\r\non corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech,\r\nbacked by criminal sanctions. It is a ban notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a\r\nseparate association from the corporation. Because speech is an es\r\nsential mechanism of democracy—it is the means to hold officials ac\r\ncountable to the people—political speech must prevail against laws\r\nthat would suppress it by design or inadvertence. Laws burdening\r\nsuch speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Gov\r\nernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest\r\nand is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 464. This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting\r\nthe interests in this case. Premised on mistrust of governmental\r\npower, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor cer\r\ntain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speak\r\ners, which may be a means to control content. The Government may\r\nalso commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain\r\n4        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    preferred speakers. There is no basis for the proposition that, in the\r\n    political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on\r\n    certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead to this con\r\n    clusion. Pp. 20–25.\r\n         (b) The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies\r\n    to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n    765, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political\r\n    speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428–429. Address\r\n    ing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the\r\n    Buckley Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18\r\n    U. S. C. §608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing\r\n    quid pro quo corruption. 424 U. S., at 25–26. However, the Court in\r\n    validated §608(e)’s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals,\r\n    corporations, and unions, because it “fail[ed] to serve any substantial\r\n    governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of cor\r\n    ruption in the electoral process,” id., at 47–48. While Buckley did not\r\n    consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expendi\r\n    tures found in §610, had that provision been challenged in Buckley’s\r\n    wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent’s reasoning\r\n    and analysis. The Buckley Court did not invoke the overbreadth doc\r\n    trine to suggest that §608(e)’s expenditure ban would have been con\r\n    stitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not indi\r\n    viduals. Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified\r\n    §610’s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C. §441b, the\r\n    provision at issue. Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaf\r\n    firmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the\r\n    power to restrict political speech based on the speaker’s corporate\r\n    identity. 435 U.S., at 784–785. Thus the law stood until Austin up\r\n    held a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing\r\n    Buckley and Bellotti by recognizing a new governmental interest in\r\n    preventing “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggrega\r\n    tions of [corporate] wealth . . . that have little or no correlation to the\r\n    public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at\r\n    660. Pp. 25–32.\r\n         (c) This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a\r\n    pre-Austin line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker’s\r\n    corporate identity and a post-Austin line permitting them. Neither\r\n    Austin’s antidistortion rationale nor the Government’s other justifica\r\n    tions support §441b’s restrictions. Pp. 32–47.\r\n            (1) The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or\r\n    jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political\r\n    speech, but Austin’s antidistortion rationale would permit the Gov\r\n    ernment to ban political speech because the speaker is an association\r\n    with a corporate form. Political speech is “indispensable to decision\r\n                   Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech\r\ncomes from a corporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 777 (footnote omitted).\r\nThis protection is inconsistent with Austin’s rationale, which is\r\nmeant to prevent corporations from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage\r\nin the political marketplace’ ” by using “ ‘resources amassed in the\r\neconomic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., at 659. First Amendment protec\r\ntions do not depend on the speaker’s “financial ability to engage in\r\npublic discussion.” Buckley, supra, at 49. These conclusions were re\r\naffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that in\r\ncreased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent\r\nmade certain expenditures from personal funds. Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Distinguishing wealthy indi\r\nviduals from corporations based on the latter’s special advantages of,\r\ne.g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting\r\nspeech. It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate\r\nfunds may “have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the\r\ncorporation’s political ideas.” Austin, supra, at 660. All speakers, in\r\ncluding individuals and the media, use money amassed from the eco\r\nnomic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment\r\nprotects the resulting speech. Under the antidistortion rationale,\r\nCongress could also ban political speech of media corporations. Al\r\nthough currently exempt from §441b, they accumulate wealth with\r\nthe help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth,\r\nand may express views “hav[ing] little or no correlation to the public’s\r\nsupport” for those views. Differential treatment of media corpora\r\ntions and other corporations cannot be squared with the First\r\nAmendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amend\r\nment’s original meaning would permit suppressing media corpora\r\ntions’ political speech. Austin interferes with the “open marketplace”\r\nof ideas protected by the First Amendment. New York State Bd. of\r\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208. Its censorship is vast in\r\nits reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit,\r\nboth small and large, corporations. Pp. 32–40.\r\n        (2) This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Govern\r\nment’s other arguments. It reasons that corporate political speech\r\ncan be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance. The Buckley\r\nCourt found this rationale “sufficiently important” to allow contribu\r\ntion limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits,\r\n424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here. While a single\r\nBellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at\r\n788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures,\r\nincluding those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption\r\nor the appearance of corruption. That speakers may have influence\r\nover or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials\r\n6        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    are corrupt. And the appearance of influence or access will not cause\r\n    the electorate to lose faith in this democracy. Caperton v. A. T.\r\n    Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished. Pp. 40–45.\r\n             (3) The Government’s asserted interest in protecting share\r\n    holders from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the anti\r\n    distortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political\r\n    speech even of media corporations. The statute is underinclusive; it\r\n    only protects a dissenting shareholder’s interests in certain media for\r\n    30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be impli\r\n    cated in any media at any time. It is also overinclusive because it\r\n    covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder. P. 46.\r\n               (4) Because §441b is not limited to corporations or associa\r\n    tions created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign\r\n    shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recog\r\n    nize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence\r\n    over the Nation’s political process. Pp. 46–47.\r\n          (d) The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare\r\n    decisis, beyond workability—the precedent’s antiquity, the reliance\r\n    interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned—\r\n    counsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the\r\n    precedents of Buckley and Bellotti. As already explained, Austin was\r\n    not well reasoned. It is also undermined by experience since its an\r\n    nouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in this country’s culture\r\n    that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws. Rapid\r\n    changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the\r\n    concept of free expression—counsel against upholding a law that re\r\n    stricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. In\r\n    addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake. Thus, due consid\r\n    eration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled. The\r\n    Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that\r\n    the Government may not suppress political speech based on the\r\n    speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest jus\r\n    tifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corpora\r\n    tions. Pp. 47–50.\r\n       3. BCRA §§201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for Hillary\r\n    and to the movie itself. Pp. 50–57.\r\n          (a) Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the abil\r\n    ity to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activi\r\n    ties,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, or “ ‘ “prevent anyone from speak\r\n    ing,” ’ ” McConnell, supra, at 201. The Buckley Court explained that\r\n    disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing\r\n    “the electorate with information” about election-related spending\r\n    sources. The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial\r\n    challenges to §§201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. However, the Court\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n  acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a\r\n  group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosing its con\r\n  tributors’ names would “ ‘subject them to threats, harassment, or re\r\n  prisals from either Government officials or private parties.’ ” Id., at\r\n  198. Pp. 50–52.\r\n       (b) The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as ap\r\n  plied to Citizens United’s ads. They fall within BCRA’s “electioneer\r\n  ing communication” definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton\r\n  by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references\r\n  to her candidacy. Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the\r\n  electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and “insure that the voters are\r\n  fully informed” about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76. At the\r\n  very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not\r\n  funded by a candidate or political party. Citizens United’s arguments\r\n  that §311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broad\r\n  cast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that\r\n  §311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s speech\r\n  were rejected in McConnell. This Court also rejects their contention\r\n  that §201’s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that\r\n  is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTL’s test\r\n  for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469–476\r\n  (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). Disclosure is the less-restrictive alterna\r\n  tive to more comprehensive speech regulations. Such requirements\r\n  have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell. Citizens United’s ar\r\n  gument that no informational interest justifies applying §201 to its\r\n  ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to dis\r\n  claimers. Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements\r\n  can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no\r\n  evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or\r\n  reprisals that might make §201 unconstitutional as applied. Pp. 52–\r\n  55.\r\n       (c) For these same reasons, this Court affirms the application of\r\n  the §§201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Hillary.\r\n  Pp. 55–56.\r\nReversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.\r\n\r\n   KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\r\nC.

S. C. §441b. Limits\r\non electioneering communications were upheld in McCon\r\nnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 203–209\r\n(2003). The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent\r\non an earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Com\r\nmerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990). Austin had held that political\r\nspeech may be banned based on the speaker’s corporate\r\nidentity.\r\n  In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in\r\neffect, McConnell. It has been noted that “Austin was a\r\nsignificant departure from ancient First Amendment\r\nprinciples,” Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to\r\nLife, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 490 (2007) (WRTL) (SCALIA, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). We agree\r\nwith that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not\r\ncompel the continued acceptance of Austin. The Govern\r\n2     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nment may regulate corporate political speech through\r\ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not\r\nsuppress that speech altogether. We turn to the case now\r\nbefore us.\r\n                               I\r\n\r\n                               A\r\n\r\n   Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It brought\r\nthis action in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. A three-judge court later convened\r\nto hear the cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to\r\nthis appeal.\r\n   Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12\r\nmillion. Most of its funds are from donations by individu\r\nals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds\r\nfrom for-profit corporations.\r\n   In January 2008, Citizens United released a film enti\r\ntled Hillary: The Movie. We refer to the film as Hillary. It\r\nis a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary\r\nClinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party’s\r\n2008 Presidential primary elections. Hillary mentions\r\nSenator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with\r\npolitical commentators and other persons, most of them\r\nquite critical of Senator Clinton. Hillary was released in\r\ntheaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to\r\nincrease distribution by making it available through video\r\non-demand.\r\n   Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to\r\nselect programming from various menus, including mov\r\nies, television shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer\r\ncan watch the program at any time and can elect to re\r\nwind or pause the program. In December 2007, a cable\r\ncompany offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make\r\nHillary available on a video-on-demand channel called\r\n“Elections ’08.” App. 255a–257a. Some video-on-demand\r\nservices require viewers to pay a small fee to view a se\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Each ad includes a short (and, in our view,\r\npejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by\r\nthe name of the movie and the movie’s Website address.\r\nId., at 26a–27a. Citizens United desired to promote the\r\nvideo-on-demand offering by running advertisements on\r\nbroadcast and cable television.\r\n                              B\r\n   Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\r\n(BCRA), federal law prohibited—and still does prohibit—\r\ncorporations and unions from using general treasury\r\nfunds to make direct contributions to candidates or inde\r\npendent expenditures that expressly advocate the election\r\nor defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in\r\nconnection with certain qualified federal elections. 2\r\nU. S. C. §441b (2000 ed.); see McConnell, supra, at 204,\r\nand n. 87; Federal Election Comm’n v. Massachusetts\r\nCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 249 (1986) (MCFL).\r\nBCRA §203 amended §441b to prohibit any “electioneering\r\ncommunication” as well. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.).\r\nAn electioneering communication is defined as “any broad\r\ncast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a\r\nclearly identified candidate for Federal office” and is made\r\nwithin 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general elec\r\ntion. §434(f)(3)(A). The Federal Election Commission’s\r\n(FEC) regulations further define an electioneering com\r\nmunication as a communication that is “publicly distrib\r\nuted.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009). “In the case of a\r\ncandidate for nomination for President . . . publicly dis\r\ntributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received\r\nby 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary\r\n4     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nelection . . . is being held within 30 days.”\r\n§100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from\r\nusing their general treasury funds for express advocacy or\r\nelectioneering communications.      They may establish,\r\nhowever, a “separate segregated fund” (known as a politi\r\ncal action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2\r\nU. S. C. §441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segre\r\ngated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and\r\nemployees of the corporation or, in the case of unions,\r\nmembers of the union. Ibid.\r\n                              C\r\n   Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available\r\nthrough video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008\r\nprimary elections. It feared, however, that both the film\r\nand the ads would be covered by §441b’s ban on corporate\r\nfunded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the\r\ncorporation to civil and criminal penalties under §437g. In\r\nDecember 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) §441b\r\nis unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA’s\r\ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§201 and\r\n311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the\r\nthree ads for the movie.\r\n   The District Court denied Citizens United’s motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (DC 2008)\r\n(per curiam), and then granted the FEC’s motion for\r\nsummary judgment, App. 261a–262a. See id., at 261a\r\n(“Based on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that\r\nthe [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See\r\nCitizen[s] United v. FEC, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C.\r\n2008) (denying Citizens United’s request for a preliminary\r\ninjunction)”). The court held that §441b was facially\r\nconstitutional under McConnell, and that §441b was\r\nconstitutional as applied to Hillary because it was “sus\r\nceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Supp. 2d, at 279. The court also\r\nrejected Citizens United’s challenge to BCRA’s disclaimer\r\nand disclosure requirements. It noted that “the Supreme\r\nCourt has written approvingly of disclosure provisions\r\ntriggered by political speech even though the speech itself\r\nwas constitutionally protected under the First Amend\r\nment.” Id., at 281.\r\n   We noted probable jurisdiction. 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\r\nThe case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked\r\nthe parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether\r\nwe should overrule either or both Austin and the part of\r\nMcConnell which addresses the facial validity of 2 U. S. C.\r\n§441b. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\r\n                           II\r\n  Before considering whether Austin should be overruled,\r\nwe first address whether Citizens United’s claim that\r\n§441b cannot be applied to Hillary may be resolved on\r\nother, narrower grounds.\r\n                              A\r\n   Citizens United contends that §441b does not cover\r\nHillary, as a matter of statutory interpretation, because\r\nthe film does not qualify as an “electioneering communica\r\ntion.” §441b(b)(2). Citizens United raises this issue for\r\nthe first time before us, but we consider the issue because\r\n“it was addressed by the court below.” Lebron v. National\r\nRailroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995);\r\nsee 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 277, n. 6. Under the definition of\r\nelectioneering communication, the video-on-demand show\r\ning of Hillary on cable television would have been a “cable\r\n. . . communication” that “refer[red] to a clearly identified\r\ncandidate for Federal office” and that was made within 30\r\n6     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndays of a primary election. 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3)(A)(i).\r\nCitizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not\r\n“publicly distributed,” because a single video-on-demand\r\ntransmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter\r\nbox and each separate transmission, in most instances,\r\nwill be seen by just one household—not 50,000 or more\r\npersons. 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2); see §100.29(b)(3)(ii).\r\n   This argument ignores the regulation’s instruction on\r\nhow to determine whether a cable transmission “[c]an be\r\nreceived by 50,000 or more persons.” §100.29(b)(3)(ii).\r\nThe regulation provides that the number of people who\r\ncan receive a cable transmission is determined by the\r\nnumber of cable subscribers in the relevant area.\r\n§§100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to\r\nuse a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million\r\nsubscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, Hillary could\r\nhave been received by 50,000 persons or more.\r\n   One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the\r\ncondition that the communication “[c]an be received by\r\n50,000 or more persons,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require “a\r\nplausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed\r\nby 50,000 or more potential voters”—as opposed to requir\r\ning only that the communication is “technologically capa\r\nble” of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former\r\nOfficials of the American Civil Liberties Union as Amici\r\nCuriae 5. Whether the population and demographic sta\r\ntistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000\r\nregistered voters—but not “infants, pre-teens, or otherwise\r\nelectorally ineligible recipients”—would be a required\r\ndetermination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in\r\nany case where the issue was in doubt. Id., at 6.\r\n   In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the\r\nreach of 2 U. S. C. §441b through this suggested interpre\r\ntation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation,\r\nthis result would require a calculation as to the number of\r\npeople a particular communication is likely to reach, with\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nan inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker\r\nto criminal sanctions. The First Amendment does not\r\npermit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign\r\nfinance attorney, conduct demographic marketing re\r\nsearch, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the\r\nmost salient political issues of our day. Prolix laws chill\r\nspeech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech:\r\nPeople “of common intelligence must necessarily guess at\r\n[the law’s] meaning and differ as to its application.” Con\r\nnally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926).\r\nThe Government may not render a ban on political speech\r\nconstitutional by carving out a limited exemption through\r\nan amorphous regulatory interpretation. We must reject\r\nthe approach suggested by the amici. Section 441b covers\r\nHillary.\r\n                              B\r\n   Citizens United next argues that §441b may not be\r\napplied to Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.\r\nMcConnell decided that §441b(b)(2)’s definition of an\r\n“electioneering communication” was facially constitutional\r\ninsofar as it restricted speech that was “the functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy” for or against a specific\r\ncandidate. 540 U. S., at 206. WRTL then found an uncon\r\nstitutional application of §441b where the speech was not\r\n“express advocacy or its functional equivalent.” 551 U. S.,\r\nat 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). As explained by THE\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE’s controlling opinion in WRTL, the func\r\ntional-equivalent test is objective: “a court should find that\r\n[a communication] is the functional equivalent of express\r\nadvocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable inter\r\npretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a\r\nspecific candidate.” Id., at 469–470.\r\n   Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advo\r\ncacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative\r\nadvertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator\r\n8     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nClinton for President. In light of historical footage, inter\r\nviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration,\r\nthe film would be understood by most viewers as an ex\r\ntended criticism of Senator Clinton’s character and her\r\nfitness for the office of the Presidency. The narrative may\r\ncontain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but\r\nthere is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is\r\nunfit for the Presidency. The movie concentrates on al\r\nleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration,\r\nSenator Clinton’s qualifications and fitness for office, and\r\npolicies the commentators predict she would pursue if\r\nelected President. It calls Senator Clinton “Machiavel\r\nlian,” App. 64a, and asks whether she is “the most quali\r\nfied to hit the ground running if elected President,” id., at\r\n88a. The narrator reminds viewers that “Americans have\r\nnever been keen on dynasties” and that “a vote for Hillary\r\nis a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the\r\nWhite House,” id., at 143a–144a.\r\n   Citizens United argues that Hillary is just “a documen\r\ntary film that examines certain historical events.” Brief\r\nfor Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie’s consistent\r\nemphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator\r\nClinton’s candidacy for President. The narrator begins by\r\nasking “could [Senator Clinton] become the first female\r\nPresident in the history of the United States?” App. 35a.\r\nAnd the narrator reiterates the movie’s message in his\r\nclosing line: “Finally, before America decides on our next\r\npresident, voters should need no reminders of . . . what’s\r\nat stake—the well being and prosperity of our nation.”\r\nId., at 144a–145a.\r\n   As the District Court found, there is no reasonable\r\ninterpretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote\r\nagainst Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in\r\nMcConnell and further elaborated in WRTL, the film\r\nqualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010) \r\n          9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\n                              C\r\n\r\n   Citizens United further contends that §441b should be\r\ninvalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on\r\ndemand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower\r\nrisk of distorting the political process than do television\r\nads. Cf. McConnell, supra, at 207. On what we might call\r\nconventional television, advertising spots reach viewers\r\nwho have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unre\r\nlated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by con\r\ntrast, the viewer selects a program after taking “a series of\r\naffirmative steps”: subscribing to cable; navigating\r\nthrough various menus; and selecting the program. See\r\nReno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867\r\n(1997).\r\n   While some means of communication may be less effec\r\ntive than others at influencing the public in different\r\ncontexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which\r\nmeans of communications are to be preferred for the par\r\nticular type of message and speaker would raise questions\r\nas to the courts’ own lawful authority. Substantial ques\r\ntions would arise if courts were to begin saying what\r\nmeans of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in\r\nall events, those differentiations might soon prove to be\r\nirrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid\r\nflux. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512\r\nU. S. 622, 639 (1994).\r\n   Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We\r\nmust decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional\r\nlines based on the particular media or technology used to\r\ndisseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It\r\nmust be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would\r\nrequire substantial litigation over an extended time, all to\r\ninterpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First\r\nAmendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would\r\ncreate an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling\r\nprotected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions\r\n10    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthat, in the end, would themselves be questionable. First\r\nAmendment standards, however, “must give the benefit of\r\nany doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.”\r\nWRTL, 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing\r\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269–270\r\n(1964)).\r\n                              D\r\n  Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to\r\n§441b’s expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political\r\nspeech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an\r\nalternative to reconsidering Austin, the Government also\r\nseems to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, how\r\never, would be unavailing.\r\n  In MCFL, the Court found unconstitutional §441b’s\r\nrestrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to non\r\nprofit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose\r\nof promoting political ideas, did not engage in business\r\nactivities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit\r\ncorporations or labor unions. 479 U. S., at 263–264; see\r\nalso 11 CFR §114.10. BCRA’s so-called Wellstone Amend\r\nment applied §441b’s expenditure ban to all nonprofit\r\ncorporations. See 2 U. S. C. §441b(c)(6); McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 209. McConnell then interpreted the Wellstone\r\nAmendment to retain the MCFL exemption to §441b’s\r\nexpenditure prohibition. 540 U. S., at 211. Citizens\r\nUnited does not qualify for the MCFL exemption, however,\r\nsince some funds used to make the movie were donations\r\nfrom for-profit corporations.\r\n  The Government suggests we could find BCRA’s\r\nWellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the\r\nstatute, and hold that Citizens United’s speech is exempt\r\nfrom §441b’s ban under BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords Amend\r\nment, §441b(c)(2). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38 (Sept. 9,\r\n2009). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a\r\nbackup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAmendment is invalidated. See McConnell, supra, at 339\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\r\ning in part). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would ex\r\nempt from §441b’s expenditure ban the political speech of\r\ncertain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded\r\n“exclusively” by individual donors and the funds were\r\nmaintained in a segregated account. §441b(c)(2). Citizens\r\nUnited would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemp\r\ntion, under its terms as written, because Hillary was\r\nfunded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.\r\n   Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argu\r\nment, the Court would be required to revise the text of\r\nMCFL, sever BCRA’s Wellstone Amendment, §441b(c)(6),\r\nand ignore the plain text of BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords\r\nAmendment, §441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a\r\nde minimis exception to MCFL or the Snowe-Jeffords\r\nAmendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corpo\r\nrate general treasury funds to be spent for independent\r\nexpenditures that support candidates. There is no princi\r\npled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin’s hold\r\ning that the Government can restrict corporate independ\r\nent expenditures for political speech.\r\n   Though it is true that the Court should construe stat\r\nutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the\r\nseries of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view\r\nof the language of the statute. In addition to those diffi\r\nculties the Government’s suggestion is troubling for still\r\nanother reason. The Government does not say that it\r\nagrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider. See\r\nSupp. Brief for Appellee 3, n. 1 (“Some courts” have im\r\nplied a de minimis exception, and “appellant would appear\r\nto be covered by these decisions”). Presumably it would\r\nfind textual difficulties in this approach too. The Govern\r\nment, like any party, can make arguments in the alterna\r\ntive; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative\r\nproposal instead of merely suggesting it. This is especially\r\n12    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntrue in the context of the First Amendment. As the Gov\r\nernment stated, this case “would require a remand” to\r\napply a de minimis standard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9,\r\n2009). Applying this standard would thus require case-by\r\ncase determinations. But archetypical political speech\r\nwould be chilled in the meantime. “ ‘First Amendment\r\nfreedoms need breathing space to survive.’ ” WRTL, supra,\r\nat 468–469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting NAACP v.\r\nButton, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963)). We decline to adopt an\r\ninterpretation that requires intricate case-by-case deter\r\nminations to verify whether political speech is banned,\r\nespecially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corpo\r\nration has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.\r\n                             E\r\n   As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot\r\nresolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling\r\npolitical speech, speech that is central to the meaning and\r\npurpose of the First Amendment. See Morse v. Frederick,\r\n551 U. S. 393, 403 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to\r\naccept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can\r\navoid another argument with broader implications. In\r\ndeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties\r\nwere it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the\r\nnecessity of making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a\r\nvalid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consid\r\neration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression\r\nupheld in Austin.\r\n   Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its\r\ncomplaint, which raised a facial challenge to §441b, even\r\nthough count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App.\r\n23a (count 3: “As applied to Hillary, [§441b] is unconstitu\r\ntional under the First Amendment guarantees of free\r\nexpression and association”). The Government argues\r\nthat Citizens United waived its challenge to Austin by\r\ndismissing count 5. We disagree.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial\r\nchallenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that\r\nwould not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or\r\naddressing the facial validity of §441b in this case. “Our\r\npractice ‘permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below]\r\nso long as it has been passed upon . . . .’ ” Lebron, 513\r\nU. S., at 379 (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U. S.\r\n36, 41 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the\r\nDistrict Court addressed Citizens United’s facial chal\r\nlenge. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (“Citizens wants us to\r\nenjoin the operation of BCRA §203 as a facially unconsti\r\ntutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom\r\nof speech”). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it “would\r\nhave to overrule McConnell” for Citizens United to prevail\r\non its facial challenge and that “[o]nly the Supreme Court\r\nmay overrule its decisions.” Ibid. (citing Rodriguez de\r\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\r\n484 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much\r\nanalysis regarding the facial challenge because it could\r\nnot ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in\r\nAustin or McConnell. Even so, the District Court did\r\n“ ‘pas[s] upon’ ” the issue. Lebron, supra, at 379. Fur\r\nthermore, the District Court’s later opinion, which granted\r\nthe FEC summary judgment, was “[b]ased on the reason\r\ning of [its] prior opinion,” which included the discussion of\r\nthe facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F. Supp. 2d\r\n274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity\r\nof the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to\r\nAustin in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (“Austin\r\nwas wrongly decided and should be overruled”); id., at 30–\r\n32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider\r\nCitizens United’s challenge to Austin and the facial valid\r\nity of §441b’s expenditure ban.\r\n   Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has\r\nasserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First\r\nAmendment right to free speech. All concede that this\r\n14    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nclaim is properly before us. And “ ‘[o]nce a federal claim is\r\nproperly presented, a party can make any argument in\r\nsupport of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise\r\narguments they made below.’ ” Lebron, supra, at 379\r\n(quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992);\r\nalteration in original). Citizens United’s argument that\r\nAustin should be overruled is “not a new claim.” Lebron,\r\n513 U. S., at 379. Rather, it is—at most—“a new argu\r\nment to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that\r\n[the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it\r\nwas obliged to provide by the First Amendment.” Ibid.\r\n   Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied\r\nchallenges is not so well defined that it has some auto\r\nmatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings\r\nand disposition in every case involving a constitutional\r\nchallenge. The distinction is both instructive and neces\r\nsary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by\r\nthe Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint. See\r\nUnited States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 477–\r\n478 (1995) (contrasting “a facial challenge” with “a nar\r\nrower remedy”). The parties cannot enter into a stipula\r\ntion that prevents the Court from considering certain\r\nremedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim\r\nthat has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved\r\nits First Amendment challenge to §441b as applied to the\r\nfacts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we can\r\nnot easily address that issue without assuming a prem\r\nise—the permissibility of restricting corporate political\r\nspeech—that is itself in doubt. See Fallon, As-Applied and\r\nFacial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv.\r\nL. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (“[O]nce a case is brought, no\r\ngeneral categorical line bars a court from making broader\r\npronouncements of invalidity in properly ‘as-applied’\r\ncases”); id., at 1327–1328. As our request for supplemen\r\ntal briefing implied, Citizens United’s claim implicates the\r\nvalidity of Austin, which in turn implicates the facial\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

The holding\r\nand validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of\r\nthe McConnell majority opinion, which upheld BCRA’s\r\nextension of §441b. See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin,\r\n494 U. S., at 660). McConnell permitted federal felony\r\npunishment for speech by all corporations, including\r\nnonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly\r\nbefore federal elections. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. Four\r\nMembers of the McConnell Court would have overruled\r\nAustin, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined\r\nthe Court’s opinion in Austin but reconsidered that conclu\r\nsion. See 540 U. S., at 256–262 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\r\npart, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in\r\npart); id., at 273–275 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part,\r\nconcurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in\r\npart, and dissenting in part); id., at 322–338 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA, J.).\r\nThat inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was\r\nfacilitated by the extensive record, which was “over\r\n100,000 pages” long, made in the three-judge District\r\nCourt.     McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 251\r\nF. Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (McConnell\r\nI). It is not the case, then, that the Court today is prema\r\nture in interpreting §441b “ ‘on the basis of [a] factually\r\nbarebones recor[d].’ ” Washington State Grange v. Wash\r\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008)\r\n(quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)).\r\n   The McConnell majority considered whether the statute\r\nwas facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought\r\nin Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election\r\nComm’n, 546 U. S. 410, 411–412 (2006) (per curiam), and\r\nthe Court confirmed that the challenge could be main\r\ntained. Then, in WRTL, the controlling opinion of the\r\n16    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nCourt not only entertained an as-applied challenge but\r\nalso sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would\r\ncontinue to maintain the position that the record in\r\nMcConnell demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its\r\nface. 551 U. S., at 485–504 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The\r\ncontrolling opinion in WRTL, which refrained from hold\r\ning the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then\r\nbefore the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the\r\nessential elements of the Court’s opinion in McConnell,\r\nwhile vindicating the First Amendment arguments made\r\nby the WRTL parties. 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of\r\nROBERTS, C. J.).\r\n   As noted above, Citizens United’s narrower arguments\r\nare not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In\r\nthe exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary\r\nthen for the Court to consider the facial validity of §441b.\r\nAny other course of decision would prolong the substan\r\ntial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by §441b’s prohibi\r\ntions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the\r\nfacial validity of §441b is further supported by the follow\r\ning reasons.\r\n   First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position\r\nof the Government. As discussed above, see Part II–D,\r\nsupra, the Government suggests, as an alternative argu\r\nment, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.\r\nThis argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit\r\ncorporation involved here may have received only de\r\nminimis donations from for-profit corporations and that\r\nsome nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the\r\noperation of the statute. The Government also suggests\r\nthat an as-applied challenge to §441b’s ban on books may\r\nbe successful, although it would defend §441b’s ban as\r\napplied to almost every other form of media including\r\npamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65–66 (Sept. 9, 2009).\r\nThe Government thus, by its own position, contributes to\r\nthe uncertainty that §441b causes. When the Government\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nholds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a\r\nnarrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position,\r\nthe added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to\r\naddress the question of statutory validity.\r\n   Second, substantial time would be required to bring\r\nclarity to the application of the statutory provision on\r\nthese points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by\r\nsome improper interpretation. See Part II–C, supra. It is\r\nwell known that the public begins to concentrate on elec\r\ntions only in the weeks immediately before they are held.\r\nThere are short timeframes in which speech can have\r\ninfluence. The need or relevance of the speech will often\r\nfirst be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The deci\r\nsion to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns,\r\nwhen speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A\r\nspeaker’s ability to engage in political speech that could\r\nhave a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker\r\nmust first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time\r\nthe lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the\r\nlitigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor,\r\nperhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could\r\nestablish that the case is not moot because the issue is\r\n“capable of repetition, yet evading review.” WRTL, supra,\r\nat 462 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing Los Angeles v.\r\nLyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983); Southern Pacific Terminal\r\nCo. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911)). Here, Citizens\r\nUnited decided to litigate its case to the end. Today,\r\nCitizens United finally learns, two years after the fact,\r\nwhether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential\r\nprimary—long after the opportunity to persuade primary\r\nvoters has passed.\r\n   Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the\r\nintegrity of the election process. As additional rules are\r\ncreated for regulating political speech, any speech argua\r\nbly within their reach is chilled. See Part II–A, supra.\r\nCampaign finance regulations now impose “unique and\r\n18    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncomplex rules” on “71 distinct entities.” Brief for Seven\r\nFormer Chairmen of FEC et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12.\r\nThese entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different\r\ntypes of political speech. Id., at 14–15, n. 10. The FEC\r\nhas adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of ex\r\nplanations and justifications for those regulations, and\r\n1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See id., at 6, n. 7. In\r\nfact, after this Court in WRTL adopted an objective “ap\r\npeal to vote” test for determining whether a communica\r\ntion was the functional equivalent of express advocacy,\r\n551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC\r\nadopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement\r\nWRTL’s ruling. See 11 CFR §114.15; Brief for Wyoming\r\nLiberty Group et al. as Amici Curiae 17–27 (filed Jan. 15,\r\n2009).\r\n   This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on\r\nspeech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective\r\nspeakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory\r\nopinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf.\r\nNear v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 712–713\r\n(1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complex\r\nity of the regulations and the deference courts show to\r\nadministrative determinations, a speaker who wants to\r\navoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of\r\ndefending against FEC enforcement must ask a govern\r\nmental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2\r\nU. S. C. §437f; 11 CFR §112.1. These onerous restrictions\r\nthus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving\r\nthe FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented\r\nin 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmen\r\ntal practices of the sort that the First Amendment was\r\ndrawn to prohibit. See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534\r\nU. S. 316, 320 (2002); Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S.\r\n444, 451–452 (1938); Near, supra, at 713–714. Because\r\nthe FEC’s “business is to censor, there inheres the danger\r\nthat [it] may well be less responsive than a court—part of\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nan independent branch of government—to the constitu\r\ntionally protected interests in free expression.” Freedman\r\nv. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57–58 (1965). When the FEC\r\nissues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, “[m]any\r\npersons, rather than undertake the considerable burden\r\n(and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through\r\ncase-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from\r\nprotected speech—harming not only themselves but soci\r\nety as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited mar\r\nketplace of ideas.” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119\r\n(2003) (citation omitted). Consequently, “the censor’s\r\ndetermination may in practice be final.” Freedman, supra,\r\nat 58.\r\n   This is precisely what WRTL sought to avoid. WRTL\r\nsaid that First Amendment standards “must eschew ‘the\r\nopen-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,’ which ‘invit[es]\r\ncomplex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevita\r\nble appeal.’ ” 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)\r\n(quoting Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &\r\nDock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original).\r\nYet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select\r\nwhat political speech is safe for public consumption by\r\napplying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litiga\r\ntion and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they\r\nmust either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue\r\nan advisory opinion approving of the political speech in\r\nquestion. Government officials pore over each word of a\r\ntext to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11\r\nfactor test they have promulgated. This is an unprece\r\ndented governmental intervention into the realm of\r\nspeech.\r\n   The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt\r\nprotected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the\r\nearlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can\r\nand must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has\r\nbeen demonstrated. See WRTL, supra, at 482–483 (ALITO,\r\n20    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nJ., concurring); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97–98\r\n(1940). For these reasons we find it necessary to recon\r\nsider Austin.\r\n                             III\r\n   The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall\r\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” Laws\r\nenacted to control or suppress speech may operate at\r\ndifferent points in the speech process. The following are\r\njust a few examples of restrictions that have been at\r\ntempted at different stages of the speech process—all laws\r\nfound to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the\r\noutset, Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v.\r\nVillage of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 153 (2002); imposing a\r\nburden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties,\r\nSimon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime\r\nVictims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 108, 123 (1991); seeking to\r\nexact a cost after the speech occurs, New York Times Co. v.\r\nSullivan, 376 U. S., at 267; and subjecting the speaker to\r\ncriminal penalties, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,\r\n445 (1969) (per curiam).\r\n   The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal\r\nsanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corpora\r\ntions—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either\r\nto expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates\r\nor to broadcast electioneering communications within 30\r\ndays of a primary election and 60 days of a general elec\r\ntion. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under\r\n§441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial\r\nphase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts\r\nthe public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors\r\nlogging in national forests; the National Rifle Association\r\npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the chal\r\nlenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a\r\nhandgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union\r\ncreates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presiden\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntial candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of\r\nfree speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of\r\ncensorship.\r\n   Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstand\r\ning the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still\r\nspeak. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 330–333 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J.). A PAC is a separate association from the\r\ncorporation. So the PAC exemption from §441b’s expendi\r\nture ban, §441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.\r\nEven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to\r\nspeak—and it does not—the option to form PACs does not\r\nalleviate the First Amendment problems with §441b.\r\nPACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to\r\nadminister and subject to extensive regulations. For\r\nexample, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward\r\ndonations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records\r\nof the identities of the persons making donations, preserve\r\nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement\r\nand report changes to this information within 10 days.\r\nSee id., at 330–332 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 253–\r\n254).\r\n   And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed\r\nmonthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different\r\ntimes depending on the type of election that is about to\r\noccur:\r\n    “ ‘These reports must contain information regarding\r\n    the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of re\r\n    ceipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identifi\r\n    cation of each political committee and candidate’s au\r\n    thorized or affiliated committee making contributions,\r\n    and any persons making loans, providing rebates, re\r\n    funds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to op\r\n    erating expenditures in an aggregate amount over\r\n    $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed\r\n    by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized\r\n22    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n     or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggre\r\n     gating over $200 have been made; persons to whom\r\n     loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total\r\n     sum of all contributions, operating expenses, out\r\n     standing debts and obligations, and the settlement\r\n     terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.’ ”\r\n     540 U. S., at 331–332 (quoting MCFL, supra, at 253–\r\n     254).\r\nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to\r\nspeak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the\r\nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs.\r\nSee Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as\r\nAmici Curiae 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity\r\n1990–2006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/\r\n20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income:\r\n2006, Corporation Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinaf\r\nter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations\r\nfiled 2006 tax returns). PACs, furthermore, must exist\r\nbefore they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a\r\ncorporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to\r\nmake its views known regarding candidates and issues in\r\na current campaign.\r\n   Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent\r\nexpenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a “restriction on\r\nthe amount of money a person or group can spend on\r\npolitical communication during a campaign,” that statute\r\n“necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restrict\r\ning the number of issues discussed, the depth of their\r\nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buck\r\nley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 19 (1976) (per curiam). Were the\r\nCourt to uphold these restrictions, the Government could\r\nrepress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the\r\nvarious points in the speech process. See McConnell,\r\nsupra, at 251 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (Government could\r\nrepress speech by “attacking all levels of the production\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand dissemination of ideas,” for “effective public communi\r\ncation requires the speaker to make use of the services of\r\nothers”). If §441b applied to individuals, no one would\r\nbelieve that it is merely a time, place, or manner restric\r\ntion on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence enti\r\nties whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.\r\n   Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is\r\nthe means to hold officials accountable to the people. See\r\nBuckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people\r\nare sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed\r\nchoices among candidates for office is essential”). The\r\nright of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use\r\ninformation to reach consensus is a precondition to\r\nenlightened self-government and a necessary means to\r\nprotect it. The First Amendment “ ‘has its fullest and most\r\nurgent application’ to speech uttered during a campaign\r\nfor political office.” Eu v. San Francisco County Democ\r\nratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting\r\nMonitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971)); see\r\nBuckley, supra, at 14 (“Discussion of public issues and\r\ndebate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to\r\nthe operation of the system of government established by\r\nour Constitution”).\r\n   For these reasons, political speech must prevail against\r\nlaws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadver\r\ntence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to\r\nstrict scrutiny,” which requires the Government to prove\r\nthat the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is\r\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” WRTL, 551\r\nU. S., at 464 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). While it might\r\nbe maintained that political speech simply cannot be\r\nbanned or restricted as a categorical matter, see Simon &\r\nSchuster, 502 U. S., at 124 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\r\njudgment), the quoted language from WRTL provides a\r\nsufficient framework for protecting the relevant First\r\nAmendment interests in this case. We shall employ it\r\n24    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n   Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First\r\nAmendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain\r\nsubjects or viewpoints. See, e.g., United States v. Playboy\r\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000)\r\n(striking down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too,\r\nare restrictions distinguishing among different speakers,\r\nallowing speech by some but not others. See First Nat.\r\nBank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 784 (1978). As\r\ninstruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:\r\nSpeech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker\r\nare all too often simply a means to control content.\r\n   Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating\r\ncontent, moreover, the Government may commit a consti\r\ntutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred\r\nspeakers. By taking the right to speak from some and\r\ngiving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvan\r\ntaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to\r\nestablish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker’s\r\nvoice. The Government may not by these means deprive\r\nthe public of the right and privilege to determine for itself\r\nwhat speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.\r\nThe First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and\r\nthe ideas that flow from each.\r\n   The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restric\r\ntions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons,\r\nbut these rulings were based on an interest in allowing\r\ngovernmental entities to perform their functions. See, e.g.,\r\nBethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 683\r\n(1986) (protecting the “function of public school educa\r\ntion”); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union,\r\nInc., 433 U. S. 119, 129 (1977) (furthering “the legitimate\r\npenological objectives of the corrections system” (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733,\r\n759 (1974) (ensuring “the capacity of the Government to\r\ndischarge its [military] responsibilities” (internal quota\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

S. 548, 557 (1973) (“[F]ederal service should\r\ndepend upon meritorious performance rather than politi\r\ncal service”). The corporate independent expenditures at\r\nissue in this case, however, would not interfere with gov\r\nernmental functions, so these cases are inapposite. These\r\nprecedents stand only for the proposition that there are\r\ncertain governmental functions that cannot operate with\r\nout some restrictions on particular kinds of speech. By\r\ncontrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political proc\r\ness that voters must be free to obtain information from\r\ndiverse sources in order to determine how to cast their\r\nvotes. At least before Austin, the Court had not allowed\r\nthe exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public\r\ndialogue.\r\n   We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context\r\nof political speech, the Government may impose restric\r\ntions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and\r\nlogic lead us to this conclusion.\r\n                              A\r\n                              1\r\n   The Court has recognized that First Amendment protec\r\ntion extends to corporations.

Under the rationale of these precedents,\r\npolitical speech does not lose First Amendment protection\r\n“simply because its source is a corporation.” Bellotti,\r\nsupra, at 784; see Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.\r\nComm’n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 8 (1986) (plurality opinion)\r\n(“The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining\r\nwhether speech is protected. Corporations and other\r\nassociations, like individuals, contribute to the ‘discussion,\r\ndebate, and the dissemination of information and ideas’\r\nthat the First Amendment seeks to foster” (quoting Bel\r\nlotti, 435 U. S., at 783)). The Court has thus rejected the\r\nargument that political speech of corporations or other\r\nassociations should be treated differently under the First\r\nAmendment simply because such associations are not\r\n“natural persons.” Id., at 776; see id., at 780, n. 16. Cf.\r\nid., at 828 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\r\n  At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the\r\nlaws of some States and of the United States imposed a\r\nban on corporate direct contributions to candidates. See\r\nB. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance\r\nReform 23 (2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress first\r\nprohibit independent expenditures by corporations and\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          27\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nlabor unions in §304 of the Labor Management Relations\r\nAct 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U. S. C. §251 (1946\r\ned., Supp. I)). In passing this Act Congress overrode the\r\nveto of President Truman, who warned that the expendi\r\nture ban was a “dangerous intrusion on free speech.”\r\nMessage from the President of the United States, H. R.\r\nDoc. No. 334, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).\r\n   For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not\r\nreach the question whether restrictions on corporate and\r\nunion expenditures are constitutional. See WRTL, 551\r\nU. S., at 502 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in\r\nthe background of United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106\r\n(1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional\r\ncandidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that\r\n“the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the\r\nfederal expenditure prohibition’s] constitutionality” if it\r\nwere construed to suppress that writing. Id., at 121. The\r\nCourt engaged in statutory interpretation and found the\r\nstatute did not cover the publication. Id., at 121–122, and\r\nn. 20. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the\r\nconstitutional question and invalidate the Labor Man\r\nagement Relations Act’s expenditure ban. Id., at 155\r\n(Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ.,\r\nconcurring in result). The concurrence explained that any\r\n“ ‘undue influence’ ” generated by a speaker’s “large expen\r\nditures” was outweighed “by the loss for democratic proc\r\nesses resulting from the restrictions upon free and full\r\npublic discussion.” Id., at 143.\r\n   In United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567\r\n(1957), the Court again encountered the independent\r\nexpenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U. S. C.\r\n§610 (1952 ed.). See 62 Stat. 723–724. After holding only\r\nthat a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates\r\nwas covered by the statute, the Court “[r]efus[ed] to an\r\nticipate constitutional questions” and remanded for the\r\ntrial to proceed. 352 U. S., at 591. Three Justices dis\r\n28    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsented, arguing that the Court should have reached the\r\nconstitutional question and that the ban on independent\r\nexpenditures was unconstitutional:\r\n        “Under our Constitution it is We The People who\r\n     are sovereign. The people have the final say. The leg\r\n     islators are their spokesmen. The people determine\r\n     through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is\r\n     therefore important—vitally important—that all\r\n     channels of communications be open to them during\r\n     every election, that no point of view be restrained or\r\n     barred, and that the people have access to the views of\r\n     every group in the community.” Id., at 593 (opinion of\r\n     Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Black, J.).\r\nThe dissent concluded that deeming a particular group\r\n“too powerful” was not a “justificatio[n] for withholding\r\nFirst Amendment rights from any group—labor or corpo\r\nrate.” Id., at 597. The Court did not get another opportu\r\nnity to consider the constitutional question in that case;\r\nfor after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty.\r\nSee Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J.\r\nLegis. 421, 463 (2008).\r\n  Later, in Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 400–\r\n401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expendi\r\nture of union funds for political speech—again without\r\nreaching the constitutional question. The Court would not\r\nresolve that question for another four years.\r\n                             2\r\n  In Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various\r\nchallenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971\r\n(FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created\r\n18 U. S. C. §608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265,\r\nan independent expenditure ban separate from §610 that\r\napplied to individuals as well as corporations and labor\r\nunions, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, and n. 45.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           29\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Before addressing the constitutionality of §608(e)’s\r\nindependent expenditure ban, Buckley first upheld\r\n§608(b), FECA’s limits on direct contributions to candi\r\ndates. The Buckley Court recognized a “sufficiently impor\r\ntant” governmental interest in “the prevention of corrup\r\ntion and the appearance of corruption.” Id., at 25; see id.,\r\nat 26. This followed from the Court’s concern that large\r\ncontributions could be given “to secure a political quid pro\r\nquo.” Ibid.\r\n   The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid\r\npro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to\r\ncandidates from independent expenditures. The Court\r\nemphasized that “the independent expenditure ceiling . . .\r\nfails to serve any substantial governmental interest in\r\nstemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the\r\nelectoral process,” id., at 47–48, because “[t]he absence of\r\nprearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the dan\r\nger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for\r\nimproper commitments from the candidate,” id., at 47.\r\nBuckley invalidated §608(e)’s restrictions on independent\r\nexpenditures, with only one Justice dissenting. See Fed\r\neral Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Political\r\nAction Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 491, n. 3 (1985) (NCPAC).\r\n   Buckley did not consider §610’s separate ban on corpo\r\nrate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition\r\nthat had also been in the background in CIO, Automobile\r\nWorkers, and Pipefitters. Had §610 been challenged in the\r\nwake of Buckley, however, it could not have been squared\r\nwith the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See\r\nWRTL, supra, at 487 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Buckley\r\nmight well have been the last word on limitations on\r\nindependent expenditures”); Austin, 494 U. S., at 683\r\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The expenditure ban invalidated\r\nin Buckley, §608(e), applied to corporations and unions,\r\n424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45; and some of the prevailing\r\nplaintiffs in Buckley were corporations, id., at 8. The\r\n30    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nBuckley Court did not invoke the First Amendment’s\r\noverbreadth doctrine, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\r\nU. S. 601, 615 (1973), to suggest that §608(e)’s expenditure\r\nban would have been constitutional if it had applied only\r\nto corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., at 50.\r\nBuckley cited with approval the Automobile Workers dis\r\nsent, which argued that §610 was unconstitutional. 424\r\nU. S., at 43 (citing 352 U. S., at 595–596 (opinion of Doug\r\nlas, J.)).\r\n   Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified\r\n§610’s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C.\r\n§441b four months after Buckley was decided. See 90 Stat.\r\n490. Section 441b is the independent expenditure restric\r\ntion challenged here.\r\n   Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n765, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the\r\nGovernment cannot restrict political speech based on the\r\nspeaker’s corporate identity. Bellotti could not have been\r\nclearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on\r\ncorporate independent expenditures related to referenda\r\nissues:\r\n        “We thus find no support in the First . . . Amend\r\n     ment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposi\r\n     tion that speech that otherwise would be within the\r\n     protection of the First Amendment loses that protec\r\n     tion simply because its source is a corporation that\r\n     cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material\r\n     effect on its business or property. . . . [That proposi\r\n     tion] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibi\r\n     tion of speech based on the identity of the interests\r\n     that spokesmen may represent in public debate over\r\n     controversial issues and a requirement that the\r\n     speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the sub\r\n     ject to justify communication.\r\n          .            .         .            .          .\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n      “In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is\r\n    constitutionally disqualified from dictating the sub\r\n    jects about which persons may speak and the speak\r\n    ers who may address a public issue.” Id., at 784–785.\r\nIt is important to note that the reasoning and holding of\r\nBellotti did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint\r\ndiscriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the\r\nGovernment lacks the power to ban corporations from\r\nspeaking.\r\n  Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the\r\nState’s ban on corporate independent expenditures to\r\nsupport candidates. In our view, however, that restriction\r\nwould have been unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central\r\nprinciple: that the First Amendment does not allow politi\r\ncal speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate\r\nidentity. See ibid.\r\n                               3\r\n   Thus the law stood until Austin. Austin “uph[eld] a\r\ndirect restriction on the independent expenditure of funds\r\nfor political speech for the first time in [this Court’s] his\r\ntory.” 494 U. S., at 695 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). There,\r\nthe Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general\r\ntreasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a spe\r\ncific candidate. Michigan law, however, prohibited corpo\r\nrate independent expenditures that supported or opposed\r\nany candidate for state office. A violation of the law was\r\npunishable as a felony. The Court sustained the speech\r\nprohibition.\r\n   To bypass Buckley and Bellotti, the Austin Court identi\r\nfied a new governmental interest in limiting political\r\nspeech: an antidistortion interest. Austin found a compel\r\nling governmental interest in preventing “the corrosive\r\nand distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\r\nthat are accumulated with the help of the corporate form\r\nand that have little or no correlation to the public’s sup\r\n32      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nport for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at\r\n660; see id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257;\r\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500–501).\r\n                               B\r\n   The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of\r\nprecedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on\r\npolitical speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity\r\nand a post-Austin line that permits them. No case before\r\nAustin had held that Congress could prohibit independent\r\nexpenditures for political speech based on the speaker’s\r\ncorporate identity. Before Austin Congress had enacted\r\nlegislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the\r\nsame proposition before this Court. See MCFL, supra, at\r\n257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to “curb the\r\npolitical influence of ‘those who exercise control over large\r\naggregations of capital’ ” (quoting Automobile Workers,\r\nsupra, at 585)); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Elec\r\ntion Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 201 (1981) (Congress believed\r\nthat “differing structures and purposes” of corporations\r\nand unions “may require different forms of regulation in\r\norder to protect the integrity of the electoral process”). In\r\nneither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.\r\n   In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in\r\n§441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale\r\non which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but\r\nabandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two\r\nother compelling interests support Austin’s holding that\r\ncorporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an\r\nanticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J.,\r\nconcurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see id.,\r\nat 674–675 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the\r\nthree points in turn.\r\n                                 1\r\n     As for Austin’s antidistortion rationale, the Government\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           33\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndoes little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–48 (Sept.\r\n9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot\r\nsupport §441b.\r\n   If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Con\r\ngress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of\r\ncitizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the\r\nantidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it\r\nwould permit Government to ban political speech simply\r\nbecause the speaker is an association that has taken on\r\nthe corporate form. The Government contends that Austin\r\npermits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all\r\nforms of communication stemming from a corporation.\r\nSee Part II–E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009);\r\nsee also id., at 26–31 (Mar. 24, 2009). If Austin were\r\ncorrect, the Government could prohibit a corporation from\r\nexpressing political views in media beyond those pre\r\nsented here, such as by printing books. The Government\r\nresponds “that the FEC has never applied this statute to a\r\nbook,” and if it did, “there would be quite [a] good as\r\napplied challenge.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).\r\nThis troubling assertion of brooding governmental power\r\ncannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in\r\ncivic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.\r\n   Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a\r\ndemocracy, and this is no less true because the speech\r\ncomes from a corporation rather than an individual.”\r\nBellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see ibid. (the\r\nworth of speech “does not depend upon the identity of its\r\nsource, whether corporation, association, union, or indi\r\nvidual”); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48–49 (“[T]he concept that\r\ngovernment may restrict the speech of some elements of\r\nour society in order to enhance the relative voice of others\r\nis wholly foreign to the First Amendment”); Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); CIO,\r\n335 U. S., at 154–155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).\r\nThis protection for speech is inconsistent with Austin’s\r\n34    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nantidistortion rationale. Austin sought to defend the\r\nantidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corpora\r\ntions from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage in the political\r\nmarketplace’ ” by using “ ‘resources amassed in the eco\r\nnomic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., at 659 (quoting MCFL,\r\nsupra, at 257). But Buckley rejected the premise that the\r\nGovernment has an interest “in equalizing the relative\r\nability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome\r\nof elections.” 424 U. S., at 48; see Bellotti, supra, at 791,\r\nn. 30. Buckley was specific in stating that “the skyrocket\r\ning cost of political campaigns” could not sustain the\r\ngovernmental prohibition. 424 U. S., at 26. The First\r\nAmendment’s protections do not depend on the speaker’s\r\n“financial ability to engage in public discussion.” Id., at\r\n49.\r\n   The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invali\r\ndated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on con\r\ntributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain\r\nexpenditures from personal funds. See Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16)\r\n(“Leveling electoral opportunities means making and\r\nimplementing judgments about which strengths should be\r\npermitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The\r\nConstitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress,\r\nthe power to choose the Members of the House of Repre\r\nsentatives, Art. I, §2, and it is a dangerous business for\r\nCongress to use the election laws to influence the voters’\r\nchoices”). The rule that political speech cannot be limited\r\nbased on a speaker’s wealth is a necessary consequence of\r\nthe premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits\r\nthe suppression of political speech based on the speaker’s\r\nidentity.\r\n   Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a\r\nfurther argument, the Austin majority undertook to dis\r\ntinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the\r\nground that “[s]tate law grants corporations special ad\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           35\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nvantages—such as limited liability, perpetual life, and\r\nfavorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution\r\nof assets.” 494 U. S., at 658–659. This does not suffice,\r\nhowever, to allow laws prohibiting speech. “It is rudimen\r\ntary that the State cannot exact as the price of those\r\nspecial advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment\r\nrights.” Id., at 680 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\n   It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment\r\nthat corporate funds may “have little or no correlation to\r\nthe public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.”\r\nId., at 660 (majority opinion). All speakers, including\r\nindividuals and the media, use money amassed from the\r\neconomic marketplace to fund their speech. The First\r\nAmendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was\r\nenabled by economic transactions with persons or entities\r\nwho disagree with the speaker’s ideas. See id., at 707\r\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Many persons can trace their\r\nfunds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then\r\nin the form of dividends, interest, or salary”).\r\n   Austin’s antidistortion rationale would produce the\r\ndangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress\r\ncould ban political speech of media corporations. See\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“The\r\nchilling endpoint of the Court’s reasoning is not difficult to\r\nforesee: outright regulation of the press”). Cf. Tornillo,\r\n418 U. S., at 250 (alleging the existence of “vast accumula\r\ntions of unreviewable power in the modern media em\r\npires”). Media corporations are now exempt from §441b’s\r\nban on corporate expenditures.              See 2 U. S. C.\r\n§§431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i).    Yet media corporations\r\naccumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the\r\nlargest media corporations have “immense aggregations of\r\nwealth,” and the views expressed by media corporations\r\noften “have little or no correlation to the public’s support”\r\nfor those views. Austin, 494 U. S., at 660. Thus, under\r\nthe Government’s reasoning, wealthy media corporations\r\n36    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncould have their voices diminished to put them on par\r\nwith other media entities. There is no precedent for per\r\nmitting this under the First Amendment.\r\n  The media exemption discloses further difficulties with\r\nthe law now under consideration. There is no precedent\r\nsupporting laws that attempt to distinguish between\r\ncorporations which are deemed to be exempt as media\r\ncorporations and those which are not. “We have consis\r\ntently rejected the proposition that the institutional press\r\nhas any constitutional privilege beyond that of other\r\nspeakers.” Id., at 691 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing Bel\r\nlotti, 435 U. S., at 782); see Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.\r\nGreenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 784 (1985) (Bren\r\nnan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and STEVENS, JJ.,\r\ndissenting); id., at 773 (White, J., concurring in judgment).\r\nWith the advent of the Internet and the decline of print\r\nand broadcast media, moreover, the line between the\r\nmedia and others who wish to comment on political and\r\nsocial issues becomes far more blurred.\r\n  The law’s exception for media corporations is, on its own\r\nterms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidis\r\ntortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further,\r\nseparate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its\r\nown terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers\r\nothers, even though both have the need or the motive to\r\ncommunicate their views. The exemption applies to media\r\ncorporations owned or controlled by corporations that have\r\ndiverse and substantial investments and participate in\r\nendeavors other than news. So even assuming the most\r\ndoubtful proposition that a news organization has a right\r\nto speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a\r\nconglomerate that owns both a media business and an\r\nunrelated business to influence or control the media in\r\norder to advance its overall business interest. At the same\r\ntime, some other corporation, with an identical business\r\ninterest but no media outlet in its ownership structure,\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          37\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwould be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the\r\nsame issue. This differential treatment cannot be squared\r\nwith the First Amendment.\r\n  There is simply no support for the view that the First\r\nAmendment, as originally understood, would permit the\r\nsuppression of political speech by media corporations. The\r\nFramers may not have anticipated modern business and\r\nmedia corporations.      See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\r\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 360–361 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,\r\nconcurring in judgment). Yet television networks and\r\nmajor newspapers owned by media corporations have\r\nbecome the most important means of mass communication\r\nin modern times. The First Amendment was certainly not\r\nunderstood to condone the suppression of political speech\r\nin society’s most salient media. It was understood as a\r\nresponse to the repression of speech and the press that\r\nhad existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press\r\nthat were imposed in the colonies.

The great\r\ndebates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists\r\nover our founding document were published and expressed\r\nin the most important means of mass communication of\r\nthat era—newspapers owned by individuals. See McIn\r\ntyre, 514 U. S., at 341–343; id., at 367 (THOMAS, J., con\r\ncurring in judgment). At the founding, speech was open,\r\ncomprehensive, and vital to society’s definition of itself;\r\nthere were no limits on the sources of speech and knowl\r\nedge. See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American\r\nRevolution 5 (1967) (“Any number of people could join in\r\nsuch proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from\r\nall sides”); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic\r\n1776–1787, p. 6 (1969) (“[I]t is not surprising that the\r\nintellectual sources of [the Americans’] Revolutionary\r\nthought were profuse and various”). The Framers may\r\nhave been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of\r\n38    CITIZENS UNITED v.

New York State Bd. of\r\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008); see\r\nibid. (ideas “may compete” in this marketplace “without\r\ngovernment interference”); McConnell, supra, at 274\r\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.). It permits the Government to ban\r\nthe political speech of millions of associations of citizens.\r\nSee Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corpora\r\ntions filed 2006 tax returns). Most of these are small\r\ncorporations without large amounts of wealth. See Supp.\r\nBrief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of\r\nAmerica as Amicus Curiae 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million busi\r\nnesses that belong to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce\r\nhave fewer than 100 employees); M. Keightley, Congres\r\nsional Research Service Report for Congress, Business\r\nOrganizational Choices: Taxation and Responses to Legis\r\nlative Changes 10 (2009) (more than 75% of corporations\r\nwhose income is taxed under federal law, see 26 U. S. C.\r\n§301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year). This\r\nfact belies the Government’s argument that the statute is\r\njustified on the ground that it prevents the “distorting\r\neffects of immense aggregations of wealth.” Austin, 494\r\nU. S., at 660. It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.\r\n   The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The\r\nGovernment has “muffle[d] the voices that best represent\r\nthe most significant segments of the economy.” McCon\r\nnell, supra, at 257–258 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). And “the\r\nelectorate [has been] deprived of information, knowledge\r\nand opinion vital to its function.” CIO, 335 U. S., at 144\r\n(Rutledge, J., concurring in result). By suppressing the\r\nspeech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and non\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Madison). Factions should be checked\r\nby permitting them all to speak, see ibid., and by entrust\r\ning the people to judge what is true and what is false.\r\n   The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corpora\r\ntions, including small and nonprofit corporations, from\r\npresenting both facts and opinions to the public. This\r\nmakes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the more an\r\naberration. “[T]he First Amendment protects the right of\r\ncorporations to petition legislative and administrative\r\nbodies.” Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 31 (citing California\r\nMotor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508,\r\n510–511 (1972); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.\r\nNoerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 137–138 (1961)).\r\nCorporate executives and employees counsel Members of\r\nCongress and Presidential administrations on many is\r\nsues, as a matter of routine and often in private. An amici\r\nbrief filed on behalf of Montana and 25 other States notes\r\nthat lobbying and corporate communications with elected\r\nofficials occur on a regular basis. Brief for State of Mon\r\ntana et al. as Amici Curiae 19. When that phenomenon is\r\ncoupled with §441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit\r\ncorporations cannot raise a voice to object when other\r\ncorporations, including those with vast wealth, are coop\r\nerating with the Government. That cooperation may\r\nsometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a\r\nGovernment official who uses his or her authority, influ\r\nence, and power to threaten corporations to support the\r\nGovernment’s policies. Those kinds of interactions are\r\noften unknown and unseen. The speech that §441b for\r\nbids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and\r\n40    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npurpose.     References to massive corporate treasuries\r\nshould not mask the real operation of this law. Rhetoric\r\nought not obscure reality.\r\n   Even if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional,\r\nwealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials,\r\nalthough smaller corporations may not have the resources\r\nto do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated\r\nassociations can spend unlimited amounts on independent\r\nexpenditures. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S., at 503–504\r\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“In the 2004 election cycle, a mere\r\n24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142\r\nmillion to [26 U. S. C. §527 organizations]”). Yet certain\r\ndisfavored associations of citizens—those that have taken\r\non the corporate form—are penalized for engaging in the\r\nsame political speech.\r\n   When Government seeks to use its full power, including\r\nthe criminal law, to command where a person may get his\r\nor her information or what distrusted source he or she\r\nmay not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This\r\nis unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom\r\nto think for ourselves.\r\n                             2\r\n  What we have said also shows the invalidity of other\r\narguments made by the Government. For the most part\r\nrelinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government\r\nfalls back on the argument that corporate political speech\r\ncan be banned in order to prevent corruption or its ap\r\npearance. In Buckley, the Court found this interest “suffi\r\nciently important” to allow limits on contributions but did\r\nnot extend that reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U. S.,\r\nat 25. When Buckley examined an expenditure ban, it\r\nfound “that the governmental interest in preventing cor\r\nruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inade\r\nquate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.”\r\nId., at 45.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           41\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   With regard to large direct contributions, Buckley rea\r\nsoned that they could be given “to secure a political quid\r\npro quo,” id., at 26, and that “the scope of such pernicious\r\npractices can never be reliably ascertained,” id., at 27.\r\nThe practices Buckley noted would be covered by bribery\r\nlaws, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §201, if a quid pro quo arrange\r\nment were proved. See Buckley, supra, at 27, and n. 28\r\n(citing Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 839–840, and nn.\r\n36–38 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam)). The Court, in\r\nconsequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contri\r\nbutions are preventative, because few if any contributions\r\nto candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.\r\nMCFL, 479 U. S., at 260; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500; Fed\r\neral Election Comm’n v. National Right to Work Comm.,\r\n459 U. S. 197, 210 (1982) (NRWC). The Buckley Court,\r\nnevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in\r\norder to ensure against the reality or appearance of cor\r\nruption. That case did not extend this rationale to inde\r\npendent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.\r\n   “The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an\r\nexpenditure with the candidate or his agent not only\r\nundermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,\r\nbut also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be\r\ngiven as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from\r\nthe candidate.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (inde\r\npendent expenditures have a “substantially diminished\r\npotential for abuse”). Limits on independent expendi\r\ntures, such as §441b, have a chilling effect extending well\r\nbeyond the Government’s interest in preventing quid pro\r\nquo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not suffi\r\ncient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26\r\nStates do not restrict independent expenditures by for\r\nprofit corporations. The Government does not claim that\r\nthese expenditures have corrupted the political process in\r\nthose States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp.\r\nBrief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of\r\n42    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAmerica as Amicus Curiae 8–9, n. 5.\r\n   A single footnote in Bellotti purported to leave open the\r\npossibility that corporate independent expenditures could\r\nbe shown to cause corruption. 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26. For\r\nthe reasons explained above, we now conclude that inde\r\npendent expenditures, including those made by corpora\r\ntions, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of\r\ncorruption. Dicta in Bellotti’s footnote suggested that “a\r\ncorporation’s right to speak on issues of general public\r\ninterest implies no comparable right in the quite different\r\ncontext of participation in a political campaign for election\r\nto public office.” Ibid. Citing the portion of Buckley that\r\ninvalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424\r\nU. S., at 46, and a law review student comment, Bellotti\r\nsurmised that “Congress might well be able to demon\r\nstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corrup\r\ntion in independent expenditures by corporations to influ\r\nence candidate elections.” 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.\r\nBuckley, however, struck down a ban on independent\r\nexpenditures to support candidates that covered corpora\r\ntions, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that “the\r\ndistinction between discussion of issues and candidates\r\nand advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often\r\ndissolve in practical application,” id., at 42. Bellotti’s\r\ndictum is thus supported only by a law review student\r\ncomment, which misinterpreted Buckley. See Comment,\r\nThe Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and\r\nMinority Rights and Remedies, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 386, 408\r\n(1977) (suggesting that “corporations and labor unions\r\nshould be held to different and more stringent standards\r\nthan an individual or other associations under a regula\r\ntory scheme for campaign financing”).\r\n   Seizing on this aside in Bellotti’s footnote, the Court in\r\nNRWC did say there is a “sufficient” governmental inter\r\nest in “ensur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth\r\namassed” by corporations would not “be used to incur\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 207–208 (citing Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 579); see 459 U. S., at 210, and n. 7;\r\nNCPAC, supra, at 500–501 (NRWC suggested a govern\r\nmental interest in restricting “the influence of political\r\nwar chests funneled through the corporate form”). NRWC,\r\nhowever, has little relevance here. NRWC decided no\r\nmore than that a restriction on a corporation’s ability to\r\nsolicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct\r\ncontributions to candidates, did not violate the First\r\nAmendment. 459 U. S., at 206. NRWC thus involved\r\ncontribution limits, see NCPAC, supra, at 495–496, which,\r\nunlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an\r\naccepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption, see\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 136–138, and n. 40; MCFL, su\r\npra, at 259–260. Citizens United has not made direct\r\ncontributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that\r\nthe Court should reconsider whether contribution limits\r\nshould be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.\r\n   When Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov\r\nernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap\r\npearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\r\npro quo corruption. See McConnell, supra, at 296–298\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (citing Buckley, supra, at 26–28,\r\n30, 46–48); NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497 (“The hallmark of\r\ncorruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for politi\r\ncal favors”); id., at 498. The fact that speakers may have\r\ninfluence over or access to elected officials does not mean\r\nthat these officials are corrupt:\r\n    “Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in\r\n    representative politics. It is in the nature of an\r\n    elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by\r\n    necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contribu\r\n    tors who support those policies. It is well understood\r\n    that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the\r\n44    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n     only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribu\r\n     tion to, one candidate over another is that the candi\r\n     date will respond by producing those political out\r\n     comes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised\r\n     on responsiveness.” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 297\r\n     (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\r\nReliance on a “generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is\r\nat odds with standard First Amendment analyses because\r\nit is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.”\r\nId., at 296.\r\n   The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will\r\nnot cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By\r\ndefinition, an independent expenditure is political speech\r\npresented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a\r\ncandidate. See Buckley, supra, at 46. The fact that a\r\ncorporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend\r\nmoney to try to persuade voters presupposes that the\r\npeople have the ultimate influence over elected officials.\r\nThis is inconsistent with any suggestion that the elector\r\nate will refuse “ ‘to take part in democratic governance’ ”\r\nbecause of additional political speech made by a corpora\r\ntion or any other speaker. McConnell, supra, at 144 (quot\r\ning Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S.\r\n377, 390 (2000)).\r\n   Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___ (2009),\r\nis not to the contrary. Caperton held that a judge was\r\nrequired to recuse himself “when a person with a personal\r\nstake in a particular case had a significant and dispropor\r\ntionate influence in placing the judge on the case by rais\r\ning funds or directing the judge’s election campaign when\r\nthe case was pending or imminent.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\r\n14). The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant’s due\r\nprocess right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. See\r\nWithrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975). Caperton’s\r\nholding was limited to the rule that the judge must be\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           45\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrecused, not that the litigant’s political speech could be\r\nbanned.\r\n   The McConnell record was “over 100,000 pages” long,\r\nMcConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 209, yet it “does not have\r\nany direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . ex\r\npenditures,” id., at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). This\r\nconfirms Buckley’s reasoning that independent expendi\r\ntures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro\r\nquo corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that\r\nindependent expenditures even ingratiate.            See 251\r\nF. Supp. 2d, at 555–557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).\r\nIngratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.\r\nThe BCRA record establishes that certain donations to\r\npolitical parties, called “soft money,” were made to gain\r\naccess to elected officials. McConnell, supra, at 125, 130–\r\n131, 146–152; see McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 471–\r\n481, 491–506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 842–\r\n843, 858–859 (opinion of Leon, J.). This case, however, is\r\nabout independent expenditures, not soft money. When\r\nCongress finds that a problem exists, we must give that\r\nfinding due deference; but Congress may not choose an\r\nunconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to\r\nimproper influences from independent expenditures; if\r\nthey surrender their best judgment; and if they put expe\r\ndiency before principle, then surely there is cause for\r\nconcern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to\r\nseek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these\r\ninfluences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must\r\ncomply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and\r\nour tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing\r\nrule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during\r\nthe critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.\r\nHere Congress has created categorical bans on speech that\r\nare asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption.\r\n46      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N \r\n\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\n                               3\r\n\r\n   The Government contends further that corporate inde\r\npendent expenditures can be limited because of its interest\r\nin protecting dissenting shareholders from being com\r\npelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted\r\ninterest, like Austin’s antidistortion rationale, would allow\r\nthe Government to ban the political speech even of media\r\ncorporations. See supra, at 35–37. Assume, for example,\r\nthat a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper\r\ndisagrees with the political views the newspaper ex\r\npresses. See Austin, 494 U. S., at 687 (SCALIA, J., dissent\r\ning). Under the Government’s view, that potential dis\r\nagreement could give the Government the authority to\r\nrestrict the media corporation’s political speech. The First\r\nAmendment does not allow that power. There is, further\r\nmore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by\r\nshareholders “through the procedures of corporate democ\r\nracy.” Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 794; see id., at 794, n. 34.\r\n   Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder\r\nprotection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both\r\nunderinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Con\r\ngress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders,\r\nit would not have banned corporate speech in only certain\r\nmedia within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissent\r\ning shareholder’s interests would be implicated by speech\r\nin any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is\r\noverinclusive because it covers all corporations, including\r\nnonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with\r\nonly single shareholders. As to other corporations, the\r\nremedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and ex\r\nplore other regulatory mechanisms.             The regulatory\r\nmechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First\r\nAmendment.\r\n                            4\r\n     We need not reach the question whether the Govern\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           47\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nment has a compelling interest in preventing foreign\r\nindividuals or associations from influencing our Nation’s\r\npolitical process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and\r\nexpenditure ban applied to “foreign national[s]”). Section\r\n441b is not limited to corporations or associations that\r\nwere created in foreign countries or funded predominately\r\nby foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be\r\noverbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Gov\r\nernment has a compelling interest in limiting foreign\r\ninfluence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413\r\nU. S., at 615.\r\n                              C\r\n   Our precedent is to be respected unless the most con\r\nvincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts\r\nus on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the\r\nrelevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the\r\nprinciple of stare decisis include the antiquity of the\r\nprecedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course\r\nwhether the decision was well reasoned.” Montejo v.\r\nLouisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13) (over\r\nruling Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)). We\r\nhave also examined whether “experience has pointed up\r\nthe precedent’s shortcomings.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555\r\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (overruling Saucier v.\r\nKatz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001)).\r\n   These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Aus\r\ntin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier prece\r\ndents in Buckley and Bellotti. “This Court has not hesi\r\ntated to overrule decisions offensive to the First\r\nAmendment.” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 500 (opinion of SCALIA,\r\nJ.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a me\r\nchanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.”\r\nHelvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).\r\n   For the reasons above, it must be concluded that Austin\r\nwas not well reasoned. The Government defends Austin,\r\n48    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrelying almost entirely on “the quid pro quo interest, the\r\ncorruption interest or the shareholder interest,” and not\r\nAustin’s expressed antidistortion rationale. Tr. of Oral\r\nArg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see id., at 45–46. When neither\r\nparty defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of\r\nadhering to that precedent through stare decisis is dimin\r\nished. Austin abandoned First Amendment principles,\r\nfurthermore, by relying on language in some of our prece\r\ndents that traces back to the Automobile Workers Court’s\r\nflawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see\r\nBrief for Campaign Finance Scholars as Amici Curiae;\r\nHayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns,\r\nCongress, and Courts 33–35, 153–157 (1988). See Austin,\r\nsupra, at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257–258;\r\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500–501); MCFL, supra, at 257\r\n(quoting Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 585); NCPAC,\r\nsupra, at 500 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210); id., at\r\n208 (“The history of the movement to regulate the political\r\ncontributions and expenditures of corporations and labor\r\nunions is set forth in great detail in [Automobile Workers],\r\nsupra, at 570–584, and we need only summarize the de\r\nvelopment here”).\r\n   Austin is undermined by experience since its an\r\nnouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in our cul\r\nture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign\r\nfinance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 176–177\r\n(“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and\r\nspending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26\r\nU. S. C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our\r\nNation’s speech dynamic is changing, and informative\r\nvoices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions\r\nto exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have\r\nbecome adept at presenting citizens with sound bites,\r\ntalking points, and scripted messages that dominate the\r\n24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not\r\nhave monolithic views. On certain topics corporations\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           49\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmay possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best\r\nequipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of\r\nall sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected\r\nofficials.\r\n   Rapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic\r\ninherent in the concept of free expression—counsel against\r\nupholding a law that restricts political speech in certain\r\nmedia or by certain speakers. See Part II–C, supra.\r\nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective\r\nway to convey a political message. See McConnell, supra,\r\nat 261 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Soon, however, it may be\r\nthat Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking\r\nWeb sites, will provide citizens with significant informa\r\ntion about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b\r\nwould seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the\r\nelection or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created\r\nwith corporate funds. See 2 U. S. C. §441b(a); MCFL,\r\nsupra, at 249. The First Amendment does not permit\r\nCongress to make these categorical distinctions based on\r\nthe corporate identity of the speaker and the content of\r\nthe political speech.\r\n   No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court\r\nstated in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991),\r\nreliance interests are important considerations in property\r\nand contract cases, where parties may have acted in con\r\nformance with existing legal rules in order to conduct\r\ntransactions. Here, though, parties have been prevented\r\nfrom acting—corporations have been banned from making\r\nindependent expenditures. Legislatures may have en\r\nacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those\r\nbans were constitutional. This is not a compelling interest\r\nfor stare decisis. If it were, legislative acts could prevent\r\nus from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfer\r\ning with our duty “to say what the law is.” Marbury v.\r\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).\r\n   Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin, 494\r\n50    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nU. S. 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to\r\nthe principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the\r\nGovernment may not suppress political speech on the\r\nbasis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient\r\ngovernmental interest justifies limits on the political\r\nspeech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.\r\n                              D\r\n   Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing\r\nthe Government to limit corporate independent expendi\r\ntures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling\r\nAustin “effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section\r\n203, but also 2 U. S. C. 441b’s prohibition on the use of\r\ncorporate treasury funds for express advocacy.” Brief for\r\nAppellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b’s restrictions on corporate\r\nindependent expenditures are therefore invalid and can\r\nnot be applied to Hillary.\r\n   Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule\r\nthe part of McConnell that upheld BCRA §203’s extension\r\nof §441b’s restrictions on corporate independent expendi\r\ntures. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. The McConnell Court\r\nrelied on the antidistortion interest recognized in Austin\r\nto uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restric\r\ntion upheld in Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have\r\nfound this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This\r\npart of McConnell is now overruled.\r\n                             IV \r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n    Citizens United next challenges BCRA’s disclaimer and\r\ndisclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three\r\nadvertisements for the movie. Under BCRA §311, tele\r\nvised electioneering communications funded by anyone\r\nother than a candidate must include a disclaimer that\r\n“ ‘_______ is responsible for the content of this advertis\r\ning.’ ” 2 U. S. C. §441d(d)(2). The required statement\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          51\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmust be made in a “clearly spoken manner,” and displayed\r\non the screen in a “clearly readable manner” for at least\r\nfour seconds. Ibid. It must state that the communication\r\n“is not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s commit\r\ntee”; it must also display the name and address (or Web\r\nsite address) of the person or group that funded the adver\r\ntisement. §441d(a)(3). Under BCRA §201, any person\r\nwho spends more than $10,000 on electioneering commu\r\nnications within a calendar year must file a disclosure\r\nstatement with the FEC. 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(1). That\r\nstatement must identify the person making the expendi\r\nture, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which\r\nthe communication was directed, and the names of certain\r\ncontributors. §434(f)(2).\r\n   Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the\r\nability to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign\r\nrelated activities,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, and “do not\r\nprevent anyone from speaking,” McConnell, supra, at 201\r\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The\r\nCourt has subjected these requirements to “exacting scru\r\ntiny,” which requires a “substantial relation” between the\r\ndisclosure requirement and a “sufficiently important”\r\ngovernmental interest. Buckley, supra, at 64, 66 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see McConnell, supra, at 231–\r\n232.\r\n   In Buckley, the Court explained that disclosure could be\r\njustified based on a governmental interest in “provid[ing]\r\nthe electorate with information” about the sources of\r\nelection-related spending. 424 U. S., at 66. The McCon\r\nnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial chal\r\nlenges to BCRA §§201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. There\r\nwas evidence in the record that independent groups were\r\nrunning election-related advertisements “ ‘while hiding\r\nbehind dubious and misleading names.’ ” Id., at 197 (quot\r\ning McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237). The Court\r\ntherefore upheld BCRA §§201 and 311 on the ground that\r\n52    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthey would help citizens “ ‘make informed choices in the\r\npolitical marketplace.’ ” 540 U. S., at 197 (quoting McCon\r\nnell I, supra, at 237); see 540 U. S., at 231.\r\n  Although both provisions were facially upheld, the\r\nCourt acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be\r\navailable if a group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ”\r\nthat disclosure of its contributors’ names “ ‘will subject\r\nthem to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either\r\nGovernment officials or private parties.’ ” Id., at 198\r\n(quoting Buckley, supra, at 74).\r\n  For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid\r\nas applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.\r\n                            B\r\n   Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and\r\ntwo 10-second ads to promote Hillary. Under FEC regula\r\ntions, a communication that “[p]roposes a commercial\r\ntransaction” was not subject to 2 U. S. C. §441b’s restric\r\ntions on corporate or union funding of electioneering com\r\nmunications. 11 CFR §114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations,\r\nhowever, do not exempt those communications from the\r\ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA §§201\r\nand 311. See 72 Fed. Reg. 72901 (2007).\r\n   Citizens United argues that the disclaimer require\r\nments in §311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads.\r\nIt contends that the governmental interest in providing\r\ninformation to the electorate does not justify requiring\r\ndisclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including\r\nthe ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within\r\nBCRA’s definition of an “electioneering communication”:\r\nThey referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly\r\nbefore a primary and contained pejorative references to\r\nher candidacy. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2–4. The\r\ndisclaimers required by §311 “provid[e] the electorate with\r\ninformation,” McConnell, supra, at 196, and “insure that\r\nthe voters are fully informed” about the person or group\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          53\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwho is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76; see also Bellotti,\r\n435 U. S., at 792, n. 32 (“Identification of the source of\r\nadvertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so\r\nthat the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to\r\nwhich they are being subjected”). At the very least, the\r\ndisclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads\r\nare not funded by a candidate or political party.\r\n   Citizens United argues that §311 is underinclusive\r\nbecause it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertise\r\nments but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts\r\nthat §311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of\r\nthe group’s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of\r\neach advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected\r\nthese arguments in McConnell, supra, at 230–231. And\r\nwe now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclo\r\nsure provisions.\r\n   As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any\r\nevent, the disclosure requirements in §201 must be con\r\nfined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express\r\nadvocacy. The principal opinion in WRTL limited 2\r\nU. S. C. §441b’s restrictions on independent expenditures\r\nto express advocacy and its functional equivalent. 551\r\nU. S., at 469–476 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Citizens\r\nUnited seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA’s\r\ndisclosure requirements. We reject this contention.\r\n   The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restric\r\ntive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of\r\nspeech. See, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 262. In Buckley, the\r\nCourt upheld a disclosure requirement for independent\r\nexpenditures even though it invalidated a provision that\r\nimposed a ceiling on those expenditures. 424 U. S., at 75–\r\n76. In McConnell, three Justices who would have found\r\n§441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold\r\nBCRA’s disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540\r\nU. S., at 321 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist,\r\nC. J., and SCALIA, J.). And the Court has upheld registra\r\n54    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even\r\nthough Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself.\r\nUnited States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612, 625 (1954) (Con\r\ngress “has merely provided for a modicum of information\r\nfrom those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or\r\nwho collect or spend funds for that purpose”). For these\r\nreasons, we reject Citizens United’s contention that the\r\ndisclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is\r\nthe functional equivalent of express advocacy.\r\n   Citizens United also disputes that an informational\r\ninterest justifies the application of §201 to its ads, which\r\nonly attempt to persuade viewers to see the film. Even if\r\nit disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens\r\nUnited says, the information would not help viewers make\r\ninformed choices in the political marketplace. This is\r\nsimilar to the argument rejected above with respect to\r\ndisclaimers. Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial\r\ntransaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is\r\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\r\nBecause the informational interest alone is sufficient to\r\njustify application of §201 to these ads, it is not necessary\r\nto consider the Government’s other asserted interests.\r\n   Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure require\r\nments can chill donations to an organization by exposing\r\ndonors to retaliation. Some amici point to recent events in\r\nwhich donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threat\r\nened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for\r\nInstitute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 13–16; Brief for\r\nAlliance Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 16–22. In\r\nMcConnell, the Court recognized that §201 would be un\r\nconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a\r\nreasonable probability that the group’s members would\r\nface threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were\r\ndisclosed. 540 U. S., at 198. The examples cited by amici\r\nare cause for concern. Citizens United, however, has\r\noffered no evidence that its members may face similar\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          55\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthreats or reprisals. To the contrary, Citizens United has\r\nbeen disclosing its donors for years and has identified no\r\ninstance of harassment or retaliation.\r\n   Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of\r\ncorporate democracy, see Bellotti, supra, at 794, and n. 34,\r\ncan be more effective today because modern technology\r\nmakes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign\r\nfinance system that pairs corporate independent expendi\r\ntures with effective disclosure has not existed before to\r\nday. It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Con\r\ngress’ findings in passing BCRA were premised on a\r\nsystem without adequate disclosure. See McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 128 (“[T]he public may not have been fully in\r\nformed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads”); id.,\r\nat 196–197 (quoting McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237).\r\nWith the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of\r\nexpenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with\r\nthe information needed to hold corporations and elected\r\nofficials accountable for their positions and supporters.\r\nShareholders can determine whether their corporation’s\r\npolitical speech advances the corporation’s interest in\r\nmaking profits, and citizens can see whether elected offi\r\ncials are “ ‘in the pocket’ of so-called moneyed interests.”\r\n540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see MCFL, supra,\r\nat 261. The First Amendment protects political speech;\r\nand disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react\r\nto the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This\r\ntransparency enables the electorate to make informed\r\ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and\r\nmessages.\r\n                           C\r\n   For the same reasons we uphold the application of\r\nBCRA §§201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their applica\r\ntion to Hillary. We find no constitutional impediment to\r\nthe application of BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure re\r\n56    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nquirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand.\r\nAnd there has been no showing that, as applied in this\r\ncase, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or\r\nexpression.\r\n                              V\r\n   When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith\r\nGoes to Washington reached the circles of Government,\r\nsome officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its\r\ndistribution. See Smoodin, “Compulsory” Viewing for\r\nEvery Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception,\r\n35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing\r\nMr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49);\r\nNugent, Capra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29,\r\n1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have\r\ndone more than discourage its distribution—they could\r\nhave banned the film. After all, it, like Hillary, was\r\nspeech funded by a corporation that was critical of Mem\r\nbers of Congress. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be\r\nfiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a\r\npowerful force.\r\n   Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on\r\nYoutube.com might portray public officials or public poli\r\ncies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission\r\nduring the blackout period creates the background for\r\ncandidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs\r\nsolely because a corporation, other than an exempt media\r\ncorporation, has made the “purchase, payment, distribu\r\ntion, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of\r\nvalue” in order to engage in political speech. 2 U. S. C.\r\n§431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm\r\nwhere its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue\r\npreceding a real election. Governments are often hostile\r\nto speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems\r\nstranger than fiction for our Government to make this\r\npolitical speech a crime. Yet this is the statute’s purpose\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Those choices and assessments, however,\r\nare not for the Government to make. “The First Amend\r\nment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create\r\nin the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free\r\nto use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of\r\nideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the\r\nGovernment may not prescribe the means used to conduct\r\nit.” McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\r\n   The judgment of the District Court is reversed with\r\nrespect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S. C. §441b’s re\r\nstrictions on corporate independent expenditures. The\r\njudgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA’s disclaimer\r\nand disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                  It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

FEDERAL \r\n\r\n             ELECTION COMMISSION \r\n\r\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\r\n             THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\r\n                      [January 21, 2010]\r\n\r\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO\r\njoins, concurring.\r\n   The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct\r\nprohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a\r\ntheory of the First Amendment that would allow censor\r\nship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of\r\npamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other\r\nmedium that corporations and unions might find useful in\r\nexpressing their views on matters of public concern. Its\r\ntheory, if accepted, would empower the Government to\r\nprohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion\r\npieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long\r\nas the newspapers were owned by corporations—as the\r\nmajor ones are. First Amendment rights could be confined\r\nto individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse\r\nthat is at the foundation of our democracy.\r\n   The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its\r\nopinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than\r\njust the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphle\r\nteer. I write separately to address the important princi\r\nples of judicial restraint and stare decisis implicated in\r\nthis case.\r\n                           I\r\n  Judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is\r\n2     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\n“the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is\r\ncalled upon to perform.” Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142,\r\n147–148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the\r\nstakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from\r\naddressing constitutional questions except when necessary\r\nto rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v.\r\nTVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur\r\nring). This policy underlies both our willingness to con\r\nstrue ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems\r\nand our practice “ ‘never to formulate a rule of constitu\r\ntional law broader than is required by the precise facts to\r\nwhich it is to be applied.’ ” United States v. Raines, 362\r\nU. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Phila­\r\ndelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113\r\nU. S. 33, 39 (1885)).\r\n   The majority and dissent are united in expressing alle\r\ngiance to these principles. Ante, at 12; post, at 14\r\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\r\nBut I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how\r\nthese principles apply in this case.\r\n   The majority’s step-by-step analysis accords with our\r\nstandard practice of avoiding broad constitutional ques\r\ntions except when necessary to decide the case before us.\r\nThe majority begins by addressing—and quite properly\r\nrejecting—Citizens United’s statutory claim that 2 U. S. C.\r\n§441b does not actually cover its production and distribu\r\ntion of Hillary: The Movie (hereinafter Hillary). If there\r\nwere a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in\r\nCitizens United’s favor (and thereby avoiding constitu\r\ntional adjudication), it would be proper to do so. Indeed,\r\nthat is precisely the approach the Court took just last\r\nTerm in Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v.\r\nHolder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), when eight Members of the\r\nCourt agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds\r\ninstead of reaching the appellant’s broader argument that\r\nthe Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\n   It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United’s\r\nstatutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group’s\r\nvarious constitutional arguments, beginning with its\r\nnarrowest claim (that Hillary is not the functional equiva\r\nlent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest\r\nclaim (that Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494\r\nU. S. 652 (1990) should be overruled). This is the same\r\norder of operations followed by the controlling opinion in\r\nFederal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,\r\n551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL). There the appellant was\r\nable to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument\r\nbecause its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to\r\ngo on to address the broader claim that McConnell v.\r\nFederal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93 (2003), should be\r\noverruled. WRTL, 551 U. S., at 482; id., at 482–483\r\n(ALITO, J., concurring). This case is different—not, as the\r\ndissent suggests, because the approach taken in WRTL\r\nhas been deemed a “failure,” post, at 11, but because, in\r\nthe absence of any valid narrower ground of decision,\r\nthere is no way to avoid Citizens United’s broader consti\r\ntutional argument.\r\n   The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citi\r\nzens United’s claims that I find quite perplexing. It pre\r\nsumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United’s\r\nnarrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack\r\nmerit—otherwise its conclusion that the group should lose\r\nthis case would make no sense. Despite agreeing that\r\nthese narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent ar\r\ngues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one\r\nof them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitu\r\ntional question of whether Austin remains good law. It\r\neven suggests that the Court’s failure to adopt one of these\r\nconcededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority\r\nis not “serious about judicial restraint.” Post, at 16.\r\n   This approach is based on a false premise: that our\r\n4     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\npractice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily\r\nbroad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obli\r\ngation faithfully to interpret the law. It should go without\r\nsaying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground\r\nof decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be\r\nright. Thus while it is true that “[i]f it is not necessary to\r\ndecide more, it is necessary not to decide more,” post, at 14\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it is neces\r\nsary to decide more. There is a difference between judicial\r\nrestraint and judicial abdication. When constitutional\r\nquestions are “indispensably necessary” to resolving the\r\ncase at hand, “the court must meet and decide them.” Ex\r\nparte Randolph, 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va.\r\n1833) (Marshall, C. J.).\r\n   Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United’s\r\nbroader argument that Austin should be overruled, the\r\ndebate over whether to consider this claim on an as\r\napplied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the\r\npoint. Citizens United has standing—it is being injured\r\nby the Government’s enforcement of the Act. Citizens\r\nUnited has a constitutional claim—the Act violates the\r\nFirst Amendment, because it prohibits political speech.\r\nThe Government has a defense—the Act may be enforced,\r\nconsistent with the First Amendment, against corpora\r\ntions. Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the\r\nquestion before us.\r\n   Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no\r\ndifference of any substance whether this case is resolved\r\nby invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to\r\nCitizens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a\r\nholding in this case that the Act may not be applied to\r\nCitizens United—because corporations as well as indi\r\nviduals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights—\r\nwould mean that any other corporation raising the same\r\nchallenge would also win. Likewise, a conclusion that the\r\nAct may be applied to Citizens United—because it is\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Regardless whether\r\nwe label Citizens United’s claim a “facial” or “as-applied”\r\nchallenge, the consequences of the Court’s decision are the\r\nsame.1\r\n                             II\r\n  The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in\r\nthe same direction: Congress may not prohibit political\r\nspeech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union.\r\nWhat makes this case difficult is the need to confront our\r\nprior decision in Austin.\r\n  This is the first case in which we have been asked to\r\noverrule Austin, and thus it is also the first in which we\r\nhave had reason to consider how much weight to give stare\r\ndecisis in assessing its continued validity. The dissent\r\nerroneously declares that the Court “reaffirmed” Austin’s\r\nholding in subsequent cases—namely, Federal Election\r\nComm’n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003); McConnell;\r\nand WRTL. Post, at 48–50. Not so. Not a single party in\r\nany of those cases asked us to overrule Austin, and as the\r\ndissent points out, post, at 4–6, the Court generally does\r\nnot consider constitutional arguments that have not prop\r\nerly been raised. Austin’s validity was therefore not di\r\nrectly at issue in the cases the dissent cites. The Court’s\r\nunwillingness to overturn Austin in those cases cannot be\r\nunderstood as a reaffirmation of that decision.\r\n                            A\r\n  Fidelity to precedent—the policy of stare decisis—is vital\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  1 The dissent suggests that I am “much too quick” to reach this con\r\n\r\nclusion because I “ignore” Citizens United’s narrower arguments. Post,\r\nat 13, n. 12. But in fact I do not ignore those arguments; on the con\r\ntrary, I (and my colleagues in the majority) appropriately consider and\r\nreject them on their merits, before addressing Citizens United’s broader\r\nclaims. Supra, at 2–3; ante, at 5–12.\r\n6     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nto the proper exercise of the judicial function. “Stare\r\ndecisis is the preferred course because it promotes the\r\nevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of\r\nlegal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and\r\ncontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the\r\njudicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\r\n(1991). For these reasons, we have long recognized that\r\ndepartures from precedent are inappropriate in the ab\r\nsence of a “special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467\r\nU. S. 203, 212 (1984).\r\n   At the same time, stare decisis is neither an “inexorable\r\ncommand,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003),\r\nnor “a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest deci\r\nsion,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940),\r\nespecially in constitutional cases, see United States v.\r\nScott, 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978). If it were, segregation\r\nwould be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitu\r\ntional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary crimi\r\nnal suspects without first obtaining warrants. See Plessy\r\nv. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), overruled by Brown v.\r\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Adkins v. Chil­\r\ndren’s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), overruled by\r\nWest Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937);\r\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), overruled\r\nby Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). As the\r\ndissent properly notes, none of us has viewed stare decisis\r\nin such absolute terms. Post, at 17; see also, e.g., Randall\r\nv. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 274–281 (2006) (STEVENS, J.,\r\ndissenting) (urging the Court to overrule its invalidation of\r\nlimits on independent expenditures on political speech in\r\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam)).\r\n   Stare decisis is instead a “principle of policy.” Helvering,\r\nsupra, at 119. When considering whether to reexamine a\r\nprior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance\r\nof having constitutional questions decided against the\r\nimportance of having them decided right. As Justice\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nJackson explained, this requires a “sober appraisal of the\r\ndisadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the\r\nquestioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one\r\nagainst the other.” Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare\r\nDecisis, 30 A. B. A. J. 334 (1944).\r\n   In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that\r\nstare decisis is not an end in itself. It is instead “the\r\nmeans by which we ensure that the law will not merely\r\nchange erratically, but will develop in a principled and\r\nintelligible fashion.” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265\r\n(1986). Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional\r\nideal—the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual\r\ncircumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent\r\ndoes more to damage this constitutional ideal than to\r\nadvance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\r\nprecedent.\r\n   Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration\r\nitself departed from the Court’s jurisprudence, returning\r\nto the “ ‘intrinsically sounder’ doctrine established in prior\r\ncases” may “better serv[e] the values of stare decisis than\r\nwould following [the] more recently decided case inconsis\r\ntent with the decisions that came before it.” Adarand\r\nConstructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 231 (1995); see\r\nalso Helvering, supra, at 119; Randall, supra, at 274\r\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). Abrogating the errant prece\r\ndent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better\r\npreserve the law’s coherence and curtail the precedent’s\r\ndisruptive effects.\r\n   Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes\r\nthe stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its\r\nstare decisis effect is also diminished. This can happen in\r\na number of circumstances, such as when the precedent’s\r\nvalidity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably func\r\ntion as a basis for decision in future cases, when its ra\r\ntionale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in\r\nrelated areas of law, and when the precedent’s underlying\r\n8     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nreasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot\r\nkeep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and\r\ndifferent justifications to shore up the original mistake.\r\nSee, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\r\n(slip op., at 10); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2009) (slip op., at 13) (stare decisis does not control when\r\nadherence to the prior decision requires “fundamentally\r\nrevising its theoretical basis”).\r\n                              B\r\n  These considerations weigh against retaining our deci\r\nsion in Austin. First, as the majority explains, that deci\r\nsion was an “aberration” insofar as it departed from the\r\nrobust protections we had granted political speech in our\r\nearlier cases. Ante, at 39; see also Buckley, supra; First\r\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978).\r\nAustin undermined the careful line that Buckley drew to\r\ndistinguish limits on contributions to candidates from\r\nlimits on independent expenditures on speech. Buckley\r\nrejected the asserted government interest in regulating\r\nindependent expenditures, concluding that “restrict[ing]\r\nthe speech of some elements of our society in order to\r\nenhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the\r\nFirst Amendment.” 424 U. S., at 48–49; see also Bellotti,\r\nsupra, at 790–791; Citizens Against Rent Con­\r\ntrol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,\r\n295 (1981). Austin, however, allowed the Government to\r\nprohibit these same expenditures out of concern for “the\r\ncorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of\r\nwealth” in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U. S., at 660.\r\nAustin’s reasoning was—and remains—inconsistent with\r\nBuckley’s explicit repudiation of any government interest\r\nin “equalizing the relative ability of individuals and\r\ngroups to influence the outcome of elections.” 424 U. S., at\r\n48–49.\r\n  Austin was also inconsistent with Bellotti’s clear rejec\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\r\n\r\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\ntion of the idea that “speech that otherwise would be\r\nwithin the protection of the First Amendment loses that\r\nprotection simply because its source is a corporation.” 435\r\nU. S., at 784. The dissent correctly points out that Bellotti\r\ninvolved a referendum rather than a candidate election,\r\nand that Bellotti itself noted this factual distinction, id., at\r\n788, n. 26; post, at 52. But this distinction does not ex\r\nplain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on\r\nspeech in candidate elections when individuals may not.\r\n   Second, the validity of Austin’s rationale—itself adopted\r\nover two “spirited dissents,” Payne, 501 U. S., at 829—has\r\nproved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Mem\r\nbers of this Court ever since. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 483 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment); McCon­\r\nnell, 540 U. S., at 247, 264, 286 (opinions of SCALIA,\r\nTHOMAS, and KENNEDY, JJ.); Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163,\r\n164 (opinions of KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.). The simple\r\nfact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of\r\ncourse, insufficient to justify overruling it. But it does\r\nundermine the precedent’s ability to contribute to the\r\nstable and orderly development of the law. In such cir\r\ncumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Court—\r\nwhich in this case is squarely asked to reconsider Austin’s\r\nvalidity for the first time—to address the matter with a\r\ngreater willingness to consider new approaches capable of\r\nrestoring our doctrine to sounder footing.\r\n   Third, the Austin decision is uniquely destabilizing\r\nbecause it threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even\r\noutside the particular context of corporate express advo\r\ncacy. The First Amendment theory underlying Austin’s\r\nholding is extraordinarily broad. Austin’s logic would\r\nauthorize government prohibition of political speech by a\r\ncategory of speakers in the name of equality—a point that\r\nmost scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that\r\nthe dissent denies. Compare, e.g., Garrett, New Voices in\r\n10        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                      ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nPolitics: Justice Marshall’s Jurisprudence on Law and\r\nPolitics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 669 (2009) (Austin “has been\r\nunderstood by most commentators to be an opinion driven\r\nby equality considerations, albeit disguised in the lan\r\nguage of ‘political corruption’ ”) with post, at 74 (Austin’s\r\nrationale “is manifestly not just an ‘equalizing’ ideal in\r\ndisguise”).2\r\n  It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the\r\nCourt have relied on Austin’s expansive logic to justify\r\ngreater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside\r\nthe original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of\r\ncandidates running for office. See, e.g., Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 7–\r\n8) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\r\n(relying on Austin and other cases to justify restrictions on\r\ncampaign spending by individual candidates, explaining\r\nthat “there is no reason that their logic—specifically, their\r\nconcerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of\r\nwealth on our political process—is not equally applicable\r\nin the context of individual wealth”); McConnell, supra, at\r\n203–209 (extending Austin beyond its original context to\r\ncover not only the “functional equivalent” of express advo\r\ncacy by corporations, but also electioneering speech con\r\nducted by labor unions).

The dissent reads Austin to permit restrictions on\r\ncorporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that\r\nthe corporate form may help individuals coordinate and\r\npresent their views more effectively. Post, at 82. A\r\nspeaker’s ability to persuade, however, provides no basis\r\nfor government regulation of free and open public debate\r\non what the laws should be.\r\n   If taken seriously, Austin’s logic would apply most di\r\nrectly to newspapers and other media corporations. They\r\nhave a more profound impact on public discourse than\r\nmost other speakers. These corporate entities are, for the\r\ntime being, not subject to §441b’s otherwise generally\r\napplicable prohibitions on corporate political speech. But\r\nthis is simply a matter of legislative grace. The fact that\r\nthe law currently grants a favored position to media cor\r\nporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in\r\naccepting a theory that would allow government restric\r\ntions on their political speech. See generally McConnell,\r\nsupra, at 283–286 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concur\r\nring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).\r\n   These readings of Austin do no more than carry that\r\ndecision’s reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so,\r\nthey highlight the threat Austin poses to First Amend\r\nment rights generally, even outside its specific factual\r\ncontext of corporate express advocacy. Because Austin is\r\nso difficult to confine to its facts—and because its logic\r\nthreatens to undermine our First Amendment jurispru\r\ndence and the nature of public discourse more broadly—\r\nthe costs of giving it stare decisis effect are unusually high.\r\n   Finally and most importantly, the Government’s own\r\neffort to defend Austin—or, more accurately, to defend\r\nsomething that is not quite Austin—underscores its weak\r\nness as a precedent of the Court. The Government con\r\ncedes that Austin “is not the most lucid opinion,” yet asks\r\nus to reaffirm its holding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9,\r\n12    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\n2009). But while invoking stare decisis to support this\r\nposition, the Government never once even mentions the\r\ncompelling interest that Austin relied upon in the first\r\nplace: the need to diminish “the corrosive and distorting\r\neffects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accu\r\nmulated with the help of the corporate form and that have\r\nlittle or no correlation to the public’s support for the corpo\r\nration’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at 660.\r\n   Instead of endorsing Austin on its own terms, the Gov\r\nernment urges us to reaffirm Austin’s specific holding on\r\nthe basis of two new and potentially expansive interests—\r\nthe need to prevent actual or apparent quid pro quo cor\r\nruption, and the need to protect corporate shareholders.\r\nSee Supp. Brief for Appellee 8–10, 12–13. Those interests\r\nmay or may not support the result in Austin, but they were\r\nplainly not part of the reasoning on which Austin relied.\r\n   To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that\r\nAustin did not embrace either of the new rationales it now\r\nurges upon us. See, e.g., Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (“The\r\nCourt did not decide in Austin . . . whether the compelling\r\ninterest in preventing actual or apparent corruption pro\r\nvides a constitutionally sufficient justification for prohibit\r\ning the use of corporate treasury funds for independent\r\nelectioneering”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (“Aus­\r\ntin did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest\r\ncompelling interest”); id., at 61 (“[The Court:] I take it we\r\nhave never accepted your shareholder protection interest.\r\nThis is a new argument. [The Government:] I think that\r\nthat’s fair”); id., at 64 (“[The Court:] In other words, you\r\nare asking us to uphold Austin on the basis of two argu\r\nments, two principles, two compelling interests we have\r\nnever accepted in [the context of limits on political expen\r\nditures]. [The Government:] [I]n this particular context,\r\nfair enough”).\r\n   To be clear: The Court in Austin nowhere relied upon\r\nthe only arguments the Government now raises to support\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nthat decision. In fact, the only opinion in Austin endorsing\r\nthe Government’s argument based on the threat of quid\r\npro quo corruption was JUSTICE STEVENS’s concurrence.\r\n494 U. S., at 678. The Court itself did not do so, despite\r\nthe fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument.\r\nMoreover, the Court’s only discussion of shareholder pro\r\ntection in Austin appeared in a section of the opinion that\r\nsought merely to distinguish Austin’s facts from those of\r\nFederal Election Comm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens for\r\nLife, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986). Austin, supra, at 663.\r\nNowhere did Austin suggest that the goal of protecting\r\nshareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing\r\nrestrictions on First Amendment rights.\r\n   To the extent that the Government’s case for reaffirming\r\nAustin depends on radically reconceptualizing its reason\r\ning, that argument is at odds with itself. Stare decisis is a\r\ndoctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels\r\ndeference to past mistakes, but provides no justification\r\nfor making new ones. There is therefore no basis for the\r\nCourt to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has\r\nnever accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to\r\nsupport a conclusion reached on different grounds that\r\nhave since been abandoned or discredited.\r\n   Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that\r\njustify stare decisis in the first place. It would effectively\r\nlicense the Court to invent and adopt new principles of\r\nconstitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing\r\nits past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those\r\nprinciples have merit on their own. This approach would\r\nallow the Court’s past missteps to spawn future mistakes,\r\nundercutting the very rule-of-law values that stare decisis\r\nis designed to protect.\r\n   None of this is to say that the Government is barred\r\nfrom making new arguments to support the outcome in\r\nAustin. On the contrary, it is free to do so. And of course\r\nthe Court is free to accept them. But the Government’s\r\n14    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nnew arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are\r\nnot entitled to receive the special deference we accord to\r\nprecedent. They are, as grounds to support Austin, liter\r\nally unprecedented. Moreover, to the extent the Govern\r\nment relies on new arguments—and declines to defend\r\nAustin on its own terms—we may reasonably infer that it\r\nlacks confidence in that decision’s original justification.\r\n  Because continued adherence to Austin threatens to\r\nsubvert the “principled and intelligible” development of\r\nour First Amendment jurisprudence, Vasquez, 474 U. S.,\r\nat 265, I support the Court’s determination to overrule\r\nthat decision.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  We have had two rounds of briefing in this case, two oral\r\narguments, and 54 amicus briefs to help us carry out our\r\nobligation to decide the necessary constitutional questions\r\naccording to law.

This section of the dissent\r\npurports to show that today’s decision is not supported by\r\nthe original understanding of the First Amendment. The\r\ndissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid\r\nisolation from the text of the First Amendment. It never\r\nshows why “the freedom of speech” that was the right of\r\nEnglishmen did not include the freedom to speak in asso\r\nciation with other individuals, including association in the\r\ncorporate form. To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations\r\ncould pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters;\r\nbut the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in\r\nthe pursuit of those objectives could be censored.\r\n  Instead of taking this straightforward approach to\r\ndetermining the Amendment’s meaning, the dissent em\r\nbarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers’ views\r\nabout the “role of corporations in society.” Post, at 35.\r\nThe Framers didn’t like corporations, the dissent con\r\n——————\r\n 1 JUSTICE   THOMAS does not join Part IV of the Court’s opinion.\r\n2      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\ncludes, and therefore it follows (as night the day) that\r\ncorporations had no rights of free speech. Of course the\r\nFramers’ personal affection or disaffection for corporations\r\nis relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected\r\nin the understood meaning of the text they enacted—not,\r\nas the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for\r\nthat text. But the dissent’s distortion of proper analysis is\r\neven worse than that. Though faced with a constitutional\r\ntext that makes no distinction between types of speakers,\r\nthe dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated\r\nstatement from the founding era to the effect that corpora\r\ntions are not covered, but places the burden on petitioners\r\nto bring forward statements showing that they are (“there\r\nis not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that\r\nanyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude\r\nregulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,” post,\r\nat 34–35).\r\n   Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent\r\nhas dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the\r\n18th century corporations were despised. If so, how came\r\nthere to be so many of them? The dissent’s statement that\r\nthere were few business corporations during the eight\r\neenth century—“only a few hundred during all of the 18th\r\ncentury”—is misleading. Post, at 35, n. 53. There were\r\napproximately 335 charters issued to business corpora\r\ntions in the United States by the end of the 18th century.2\r\nSee 2 J. Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of American\r\nCorporations 24 (1917) (reprint 2006) (hereinafter Davis).\r\nThis was a “considerable extension of corporate enterprise\r\n——————\r\n  2 The dissent protests that 1791 rather than 1800 should be the rele\r\n\r\nvant date, and that “[m]ore than half of the century’s total business\r\ncharters were issued between 1796 and 1800.” Post, at 35, n. 53. I used\r\n1800 only because the dissent did. But in any case, it is surely fanciful\r\nto think that a consensus of hostility towards corporations was trans\r\nformed into general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and\r\n1796.\r\n                    Cite as: 558 U.

Most of the\r\nFounders’ resentment towards corporations was directed\r\nat the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually\r\nchartered corporations enjoyed.3 Modern corporations do\r\nnot have such privileges, and would probably have been\r\nfavored by most of our enterprising Founders—excluding,\r\nperhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetua\r\ntion of an agrarian society. Moreover, if the Founders’\r\nspecific intent with respect to corporations is what mat\r\nters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders’ views\r\nabout other legal entities that have more in common with\r\nmodern business corporations than the founding-era cor\r\n——————\r\n  3 “[P]eople in 1800 identified corporations with franchised monopo\r\nlies.” L.

At the time of the founding, religious, educa\r\ntional, and literary corporations were incorporated under\r\ngeneral incorporation statutes, much as business corpora\r\ntions are today.4 See Davis 16–17; R. Seavoy, Origins of\r\nthe American Business Corporation, 1784–1855, p. 5\r\n(1982); Cooke 94. There were also small unincorporated\r\nbusiness associations, which some have argued were the\r\n“ ‘true progenitors’ ” of today’s business corporations.\r\nFriedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American\r\nLand Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Develop\r\nment 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33. Were all of these\r\nsilently excluded from the protections of the First\r\nAmendment?\r\n    The lack of a textual exception for speech by corpora\r\ntions cannot be explained on the ground that such organi\r\nzations did not exist or did not speak. To the contrary,\r\ncolleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds\r\nhad long been organized as corporations at common law\r\nand under the King’s charter, see 1 W.

The dissent offers no evi\r\ndence—none whatever—that the First Amendment’s\r\nunqualified text was originally understood to exclude such\r\nassociational speech from its protection.5\r\n——————\r\n  5 The  best the dissent can come up with is that “[p]ostratification\r\npractice” supports its reading of the First Amendment. Post, at 40,\r\nn. 56. For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White’s statement\r\n(in dissent) that “[t]he common law was generally interpreted as\r\nprohibiting corporate political participation,” First Nat. Bank of Boston\r\nv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978). The sole authority Justice White\r\ncited for this proposition, id., at 819, n. 14, was a law-review note that\r\nmade no such claim. To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing\r\nwith the propriety of corporate political expenditures were “few.” Note,\r\nCorporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961).\r\nMore specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by\r\na Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana.\r\nId., at 852, n. 197. Of course even if the common law was “generally\r\ninterpreted” to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires,\r\nthat would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that\r\nwere authorized by a corporation’s charter could constitutionally be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n   As additional “[p]ostratification practice,” the dissent notes that the\r\nCourt “did not recognize any First Amendment protections for corpora\r\ntions until the middle part of the 20th century.” Post, at 40, n. 56. But\r\nit did that in Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936), a\r\ncase involving freedom of the press—which the dissent acknowledges\r\ndid cover corporations from the outset. The relative recency of that\r\nfirst case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence\r\nwas slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First\r\nAmendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until\r\n1919, see Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919); we did not\r\ninvalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see\r\n6      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\n   Historical evidence relating to the textually similar\r\nclause “the freedom of . . . the press” also provides no\r\nsupport for the proposition that the First Amendment\r\nexcludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope\r\nof its protection. The freedom of “the press” was widely\r\nunderstood to protect the publishing activities of individ\r\nual editors and printers. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\r\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 360 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concur\r\nring in judgment); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 252–\r\n253 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But these individuals often\r\nacted through newspapers, which (much like corporations)\r\nhad their own names, outlived the individuals who had\r\nfounded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes\r\nowned by more than one person, and were operated for\r\nprofit. See generally F. Mott, American Journalism: A\r\nHistory of Newspapers in the United States Through 250\r\nYears 3–164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom’s Fetters (1956).\r\nTheir activities were not stripped of First Amendment\r\nprotection simply because they were carried out under the\r\nbanner of an artificial legal entity. And the notion which\r\nfollows from the dissent’s view, that modern newspapers,\r\nsince they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only\r\nat the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.6\r\n——————\r\nStromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931), and a federal law until\r\n1965, see Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965).\r\n   6 The dissent seeks to avoid this conclusion (and to turn a liability\r\n\r\ninto an asset) by interpreting the Freedom of the Press Clause to refer\r\nto the institutional press (thus demonstrating, according to the dissent,\r\nthat the Founders “did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—\r\nbetween types of ‘speakers,’ or speech outlets or forms ”). Post, at 40\r\nand n. 57. It is passing strange to interpret the phrase “the freedom of\r\nspeech, or of the press” to mean, not everyone’s right to speak or pub\r\nlish, but rather everyone’s right to speak or the institutional press’s\r\nright to publish. No one thought that is what it meant. Patriot Noah\r\nWebster’s 1828 dictionary contains, under the word “press,” the follow\r\ning entry:\r\n   “Liberty of the press, in civil policy, is the free right of publishing\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\n  In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court’s\r\nconception of corruption is unhistorical. The Framers\r\n“would have been appalled,” it says, by the evidence of\r\ncorruption in the congressional findings supporting the\r\nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. Post, at 61.\r\nFor this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article\r\narguing that “corruption” was originally understood to\r\ninclude “moral decay” and even actions taken by citizens\r\nin pursuit of private rather than public ends. Teachout,\r\nThe Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 341,\r\n373, 378 (2009). It is hard to see how this has anything to\r\ndo with what sort of corruption can be combated by re\r\nstrictions on political speech. Moreover, if speech can be\r\nprohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads\r\nto “moral decay” or does not serve “public ends,” then\r\nthere is no limit to the Government’s censorship power.\r\n  The dissent says that when the Framers “constitutional\r\nized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it\r\nwas the free speech of individual Americans that they had\r\nin mind.” Post, at 37. That is no doubt true. All the\r\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of indi\r\nvidual men and women—not, for example, of trees or polar\r\nbears. But the individual person’s right to speak includes\r\nthe right to speak in association with other individual\r\npersons. Surely the dissent does not believe that speech\r\n——————\r\nbooks, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unre\r\nstrained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and\r\nopinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious\r\nto morals or to the peace of the state.” 2 American Dictionary of the\r\nEnglish Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).\r\n   As the Court’s opinion describes, ante, at 36, our jurisprudence\r\nagrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.\r\n   “The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodi\r\ncals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. . . . The press in\r\nits historical connotation comprehends every sort of publication which\r\naffords a vehicle of information and opinion.” Lovell v. City of Griffin,\r\n303 U. S. 444, 452 (1938).\r\n8           CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\nby the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be\r\ncensored because it is not the speech of “an individual\r\nAmerican.” It is the speech of many individual Americans,\r\nwho have associated in a common cause, giving the leader\r\nship of the party the right to speak on their behalf. The\r\nassociation of individuals in a business corporation is no\r\ndifferent—or at least it cannot be denied the right to speak\r\non the simplistic ground that it is not “an individual\r\nAmerican.”7\r\n  But to return to, and summarize, my principal point,\r\nwhich is the conformity of today’s opinion with the original\r\nmeaning of the First Amendment. The Amendment is\r\nwritten in terms of “speech,” not speakers. Its text offers\r\nno foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from\r\n——————\r\n    7 Thedissent says that “ ‘speech’ ” refers to oral communications of\r\nhuman beings, and since corporations are not human beings they\r\ncannot speak. Post, at 37, n. 55. This is sophistry. The authorized\r\nspokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of\r\nthe human beings who have formed that association—just as the\r\nspokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its\r\nmembers. The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to\r\nspeak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no\r\nproblem with a corporation’s enjoying the freedom of the press.\r\n   The same footnote asserts that “it has been ‘claimed that the notion\r\nof institutional speech . . . did not exist in post-revolutionary America.’ ”\r\nThis is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment\r\nSpeakers, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the\r\nsole support for its statement a treatise dealing with government\r\nspeech, M. Yudof, When Government Speaks 42–50 (1983). The cited\r\npages of that treatise provide no support whatever for the statement—\r\nunless, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the “institutional speech”\r\nreferred to was speech by the subject of the law-review article, govern\r\nmental institutions.\r\n   The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a\r\nprofessor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional\r\nSpeech, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent,\r\nin that it would accord free-speech protection to associations.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

We are therefore simply left with the\r\nquestion whether the speech at issue in this case is\r\n“speech” covered by the First Amendment. No one says\r\notherwise. A documentary film critical of a potential\r\nPresidential candidate is core political speech, and its\r\nnature as such does not change simply because it was\r\nfunded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that\r\nfunding produce any reduction whatever in the “inherent\r\nworth of the speech” and “its capacity for informing the\r\npublic,” First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n765, 777 (1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate\r\nspeech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free\r\neconomy.

Citizens United\r\nis a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political\r\naction committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets.\r\nUnder the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\r\n(BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and\r\npromote Hillary: The Movie wherever and whenever it\r\nwanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to\r\nbroadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days\r\nbefore the last primary election. Neither Citizens United’s\r\nnor any other corporation’s speech has been “banned,”\r\nante, at 1. All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens\r\nUnited had a right to use the funds in its general treasury\r\nto pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period. The notion\r\nthat the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer\r\nto that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided.\r\nEven more misguided is the notion that the Court must\r\nrewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by for\r\nprofit corporations and unions to decide this case.\r\n   The basic premise underlying the Court’s ruling is its\r\niteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that\r\nthe First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based\r\n2     CITIZENS UNITED v.

While that glittering generality has rhetorical\r\nappeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it\r\ntell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering\r\nthat some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even\r\nresolve the specific question whether Citizens United may\r\nbe required to finance some of its messages with the\r\nmoney in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be\r\ntreated identically to natural persons in the political\r\nsphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify\r\nthe Court’s disposition of this case.\r\n   In the context of election to public office, the distinction\r\nbetween corporate and human speakers is significant.\r\nAlthough they make enormous contributions to our soci­\r\nety, corporations are not actually members of it. They\r\ncannot vote or run for office. Because they may be man­\r\naged and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may\r\nconflict in fundamental respects with the interests of\r\neligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure,\r\nand instrumental orientation of corporations raise legiti­\r\nmate concerns about their role in the electoral process.\r\nOur lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if\r\nnot also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to\r\nguard against the potentially deleterious effects of corpo­\r\nrate spending in local and national races.\r\n   The majority’s approach to corporate electioneering\r\nmarks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has\r\nplaced special limitations on campaign spending by corpo­\r\nrations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907,\r\nch. 420, 34 Stat. 864. We have unanimously concluded\r\nthat this “reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers\r\nposed by those entities to the electoral process,” FEC v.\r\nNational Right to Work Comm., 459 U.

Wisconsin Right to Life,\r\nInc., 551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL), McConnell v. FEC, 540\r\nU. S. 93 (2003), FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003),\r\nFEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.

S. 288, 346 (1936), Justice Brandeis stressed the impor­\r\ntance of adhering to rules the Court has “developed . . . for\r\nits own governance” when deciding constitutional ques­\r\ntions. Because departures from those rules always en­\r\nhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of\r\nthis case in some detail before explaining why the Court’s\r\nanalysis rests on a faulty understanding of Austin and\r\nMcConnell and of our campaign finance jurisprudence\r\nmore generally .1 I regret the length of what follows, but\r\nthe importance and novelty of the Court’s opinion require\r\na full response. Although I concur in the Court’s decision\r\nto sustain BCRA’s disclosure provisions and join Part IV\r\nof its opinion, I emphatically dissent from its principal\r\nholding.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  1 Specifically, Part I, infra, at 4–17, addresses the procedural history\r\n\r\nof the case and the narrower grounds of decision the majority has\r\nbypassed. Part II, infra, at 17–23, addresses stare decisis. Part III,\r\ninfra, at 23–56, addresses the Court’s assumptions that BCRA “bans”\r\ncorporate speech, that identity-based distinctions may not be drawn in\r\nthe political realm, and that Austin and McConnell were outliers in our\r\nFirst Amendment tradition. Part IV, infra, at 56–89, addresses the\r\nCourt’s treatment of the anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder\r\nprotection rationales for regulating corporate electioneering.\r\n4           CITIZENS UNITED v.

The path it has\r\ntaken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this\r\ninstitution. Before turning to the question whether to\r\noverrule Austin and part of McConnell, it is important\r\nto explain why the Court should not be deciding that\r\nquestion.\r\nScope of the Case\r\n  The first reason is that the question was not properly\r\nbrought before us. In declaring §203 of BCRA facially\r\nunconstitutional on the ground that corporations’ electoral\r\nexpenditures may not be regulated any more stringently\r\nthan those of individuals, the majority decides this case on\r\na basis relinquished below, not included in the questions\r\npresented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in\r\nresponse to the Court’s invitation. This procedure is\r\nunusual and inadvisable for a court.2 Our colleagues’\r\nsuggestion that “we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in\r\neffect, McConnell,” ante, at 1, would be more accurate if\r\nrephrased to state that “we have asked ourselves” to re­\r\nconsider those cases.\r\n  In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a\r\nfacial challenge to the constitutionality of §203. App. 23a–\r\n24a. In its motion for summary judgment, however, Citi­\r\n——————\r\n    2 See\r\n        Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (“[U]nder this\r\nCourt’s Rule 14.1(a), only questions set forth in the petition, or fairly\r\nincluded therein, will be considered by the Court” (internal quotation\r\nmarks and alteration omitted)); Wood v. Allen, ante, at __ (slip op., at\r\n13) (“[T]he fact that petitioner discussed [an] issue in the text of his\r\npetition for certiorari does not bring it before us.

The District Court therefore resolved the\r\ncase on alternative grounds,3 and in its jurisdictional\r\nstatement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised\r\nus that it was raising only “an as-applied challenge to the\r\nconstitutionality of . . . BCRA §203.” Juris. Statement 5.\r\nThe jurisdictional statement never so much as cited Aus\r\ntin, the key case the majority today overrules. And not\r\none of the questions presented suggested that Citizens\r\nUnited was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to\r\n§203 that it previously agreed to dismiss. In fact, not one\r\nof those questions raised an issue based on Citizens\r\nUnited’s corporate status. Juris. Statement (i). Moreover,\r\neven in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected\r\nits request to overrule Austin, it never sought a declara­\r\ntion that §203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corpo­\r\nrations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute\r\ncould not be applied to it because it was “funded over­\r\nwhelmingly by individuals.” Brief for Appellant 29; see\r\nalso id., at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming “as applied” character\r\n——————\r\n  3 The majority states that, in denying Citizens United’s motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, the District Court “addressed” the facial valid­\r\nity of BCRA §203. Ante, at 13. That is true, in the narrow sense that\r\nthe court observed the issue was foreclosed by McConnell v. FEC, 540\r\nU. S. 93 (2003). See 530 F. Supp. 2d 274, 278 (DC 2008) (per curiam).\r\nYet as explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its\r\nfacial challenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the\r\nFederal Election Commission’s (FEC) motion for summary judgment,\r\nApp. 261a–262a, any question about statutory validity had dropped out\r\nof the case. That latter ruling by the District Court was the “final\r\ndecision” from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under\r\nBCRA §403(a)(3). As regards the lower court decision that has come\r\nbefore us, the claim that §203 is facially unconstitutional was neither\r\npressed nor passed upon in any form.\r\n6     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nof challenge to §203); Tr. of Oral Arg. 4–9 (Mar. 24, 2009)\r\n(counsel for Citizens United conceding that §203 could be\r\napplied to General Motors); id., at 55 (counsel for Citizens\r\nUnited stating that “we accept the Court’s decision in\r\nWisconsin Right to Life”).\r\n   “ ‘It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the\r\nfederal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon\r\nbelow are reviewed,’ ” Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231,\r\n234 (1976) (per curiam) (quoting Duignan v. United States,\r\n274 U. S. 195, 200 (1927)), and it is “only in the most\r\nexceptional cases” that we will consider issues outside the\r\nquestions presented, Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 481, n.\r\n15 (1976). The appellant in this case did not so much as\r\nassert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the\r\nmajority opinion in vain for the mention of any. That is\r\nunsurprising, for none exists.\r\n   Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step,\r\nbut it did not cure this fundamental problem. Essentially,\r\nfive Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the\r\ncase before us, so they changed the case to give themselves\r\nan opportunity to change the law.\r\nAs-Applied and Facial Challenges\r\n   This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years\r\nthat “[f]acial challenges are disfavored.” Washington State\r\nGrange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.\r\n442, 450 (2008); see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of\r\nNorthern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329 (2006) (“[T]he\r\n‘normal rule’ is that ‘partial, rather than facial, invalida­\r\ntion is the required course,’ such that a ‘statute may . . . be\r\ndeclared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but\r\notherwise left intact’ ” (quoting Brockett v. Spokane Ar\r\ncades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985); alteration in origi­\r\nnal)). By declaring §203 facially unconstitutional, our\r\ncolleagues have turned an as-applied challenge into a\r\nfacial challenge, in defiance of this principle.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n   This is not merely a technical defect in the Court’s\r\ndecision. The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry\r\n“run[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial\r\nrestraint that courts should neither anticipate a question\r\nof constitutional law in advance of the necessity of decid­\r\ning it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader\r\nthan is required by the precise facts to which it is to be\r\napplied.” Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 450\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Scanting that princi­\r\nple “threaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by\r\npreventing laws embodying the will of the people from\r\nbeing implemented in a manner consistent with the Con­\r\nstitution.” Id., at 451. These concerns are heightened\r\nwhen judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the\r\nlegislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge\r\nhammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of\r\nCongress’ most significant efforts to regulate the role that\r\ncorporations and unions play in electoral politics. It com­\r\npounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great\r\nmany state laws as well.\r\n   The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of\r\nthis on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United\r\nmaintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there\r\nare virtually no circumstances in which BCRA §203 can be\r\napplied constitutionally, the parties could have developed,\r\nthrough the normal process of litigation, a record about\r\nthe actual effects of §203, its actual burdens and its actual\r\nbenefits, on all manner of corporations and unions.4\r\n——————\r\n  4 Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its\r\nfacial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it\r\n“require[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial\r\nchallenge.” 1:07–cv–2240–RCL–RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar.\r\n26, 2008). By reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the\r\nCourt gives it a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which\r\nwas deprived of the opportunity to gather and present information\r\nnecessary to its rebuttal.\r\n8      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n“Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,” and\r\nconsequently “raise the risk of premature interpretation of\r\nstatutes on the basis of factually barebones records.” Id.,\r\nat 450 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case,\r\nthe record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is\r\nnonexistent. Congress crafted BCRA in response to a\r\nvirtual mountain of research on the corruption that previ­\r\nous legislation had failed to avert. The Court now negates\r\nCongress’ efforts without a shred of evidence on how §203\r\nor its state-law counterparts have been affecting any\r\nentity other than Citizens United.5\r\n   Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority\r\nthrows up its hands. Were we to confine our inquiry to\r\nCitizens United’s as-applied challenge, it protests, we\r\nwould commence an “extended” process of “draw[ing], and\r\nthen redraw[ing], constitutional lines based on the par­\r\nticular media or technology used to disseminate political\r\nspeech from a particular speaker.” Ante, at 9. While\r\ntacitly acknowledging that some applications of §203\r\nmight be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a\r\nfuture in which novel First Amendment standards must\r\n——————\r\n   5 In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how §203\r\n\r\nhas been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the\r\nDistrict Court the details of Hillary’s funding or its own finances. We\r\nlikewise have no evidence of how §203 and comparable state laws were\r\nexpected to affect corporations and unions in the future.\r\n   It is true, as the majority points out, that the McConnell Court\r\nevaluated the facial validity of §203 in light of an extensive record. See\r\nante, at 15. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any\r\nevent, the majority’s argument for striking down §203 depends on its\r\ncontention that the statute has proved too “chilling” in practice—and in\r\nparticular on the contention that the controlling opinion in WRTL, 551\r\nU. S. 449 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and “breathing space”\r\nto this area of law. See ante, at 12, 16–20. We have no record with\r\nwhich to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the\r\nburdens of complying with §203, but we have no meaningful evidence to\r\nshow how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its\r\nrestrictions.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nbe devised on an ad hoc basis, and then leaps from this\r\nunfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that\r\nsuch complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal\r\nrestraint. Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory sys­\r\ntems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies,\r\nmay raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins.\r\nThe fluid nature of electioneering communications does\r\nnot make this case special. The fact that a Court can\r\nhypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some\r\npoint down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied\r\nproblems, does not come close to meeting the standard for\r\na facial challenge.6\r\n  The majority proposes several other justifications for the\r\nsweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is\r\nnecessary because, if the Court were to continue on its\r\nnormal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they\r\npresent themselves, that process would itself run afoul of\r\nthe First Amendment. See, e.g., ante, at 9 (as-applied\r\nreview process “would raise questions as to the courts’ own\r\nlawful authority”); ibid. (“Courts, too, are bound by the\r\nFirst Amendment”). This suggestion is perplexing. Our\r\ncolleagues elsewhere trumpet “our duty ‘to say what the\r\nlaw is,’ ” even when our predecessors on the bench and our\r\ncounterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differ­\r\n——————\r\n   6 Our cases recognize a “type of facial challenge in the First Amend­\r\n\r\nment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly\r\noverbroad because a substantial number of its applications are uncon­\r\nstitutional.” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\r\nParty, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­\r\nted). Citizens United has not made an overbreadth argument, and\r\n“[w]e generally do not apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analy­\r\nsis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable over­\r\nbreadth of the contested law,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIf our colleagues nonetheless concluded that §203’s fatal flaw is that it\r\naffects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for\r\noverbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissi­\r\nble, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.\r\n10     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nently. Ante, at 49 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\r\n137, 177 (1803)). We do not typically say what the law is\r\nnot as a hedge against future judicial error. The possibil­\r\nity that later courts will misapply a constitutional provi­\r\nsion does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation\r\nrelating to that provision.7\r\n    The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary\r\nbecause anything less would chill too much protected\r\nspeech. See ante, at 9–10, 12, 16–20. In addition to beg­\r\nging the question what types of corporate spending are\r\nconstitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim\r\nrests on the assertion that some significant number of\r\ncorporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC\r\n“ ‘censor[ship].’ ” Ante, at 18–19. That assertion is unsub­\r\nstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experi­\r\nence. It is particularly hard to square with the legal land­\r\nscape following WRTL, which held that a corporate\r\ncommunication could be regulated under §203 only if it\r\nwas “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other\r\nthan as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi­\r\ndate.” 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (em­\r\nphasis added). The whole point of this test was to make\r\n§203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The\r\nCourt does not explain how, in the span of a single election\r\ncycle, it has determined THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s project to be\r\n——————\r\n   7 Also perplexing is the majority’s attempt to pass blame to the Gov­\r\n\r\nernment for its litigating position. By “hold[ing] out the possibility of\r\nruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from\r\nadopting that position,” the majority says, the Government has caused\r\n“added uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the\r\nquestion of statutory validity.” Ante, at 17. Our colleagues have\r\napparently never heard of an alternative argument. Like every liti­\r\ngant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that,\r\nit would prefer to lose on a narrow ground. The fact that there are\r\nnumerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the\r\nGovernment acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything\r\nabout the propriety of a facial ruling.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\na failure. In this respect, too, the majority’s critique of\r\nline-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied\r\nreview method generally.8\r\n   The majority suggests that, even though it expressly\r\ndismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United neverthe­\r\nless preserved it—not as a freestanding “claim,” but as a\r\npotential argument in support of “a claim that the FEC\r\nhas violated its First Amendment right to free speech.”\r\nAnte, at 13; see also ante, at 4 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring)\r\n(describing Citizens United’s claim as: “[T]he Act violates\r\nthe First Amendment”). By this novel logic, virtually any\r\nsubmission could be reconceptualized as “a claim that the\r\nGovernment has violated my rights,” and it would then be\r\navailable to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue\r\nthat might be relevant to that claim’s disposition. Not\r\nonly the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic rela­\r\ntionship between litigants and courts, would be upended if\r\nthe latter had free rein to construe the former’s claims at\r\nsuch high levels of generality. There would be no need for\r\nplaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the con­\r\nstitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the\r\nrest to us.9\r\n——————\r\n  8 The majority’s “chilling” argument is particularly inapposite with\r\n\r\nrespect to 2 U. S. C. §441b’s longstanding restriction on the use of\r\ncorporate general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was\r\never any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what\r\ncounts as express advocacy since the “magic words” test of Buckley v.\r\nValeo, 424 U. S. 1, 44, n. 52 (1976) (per curiam). Yet even though\r\nCitizens United’s briefs never once mention §441b’s restriction on\r\nexpress advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate\r\nchilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that Hillary\r\ncounts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to\r\nopine that this statutory provision is “invalid” as well. Ante, at 50.\r\n  9 The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied\r\n\r\nchallenges does not have “some automatic effect” that mechanically\r\ncontrols the judicial task. Ante, at 14. I agree, but it does not follow\r\nthat in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less\r\n12     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n  Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of\r\nCitizens United’s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is\r\nnecessary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review\r\narticle, it asserts that Citizens United’s dismissal of the\r\nfacial challenge does not prevent us “ ‘from making\r\nbroader pronouncements of invalidity in properly “as­\r\napplied” cases.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied\r\nand Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113\r\nHarv. L. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon));\r\naccord, ante, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (“Regardless\r\nwhether we label Citizens United’s claim a ‘facial’ or ‘as­\r\napplied’ challenge, the consequences of the Court’s deci­\r\nsion are the same”). The majority is on firmer conceptual\r\nground here. Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor\r\nFallon’s thesis, one must proceed to ask which as-applied\r\nchallenges, if successful, will “properly” invite or entail\r\ninvalidation of the underlying statute.10 The paradigmatic\r\ncase is a judicial determination that the legislature acted\r\nwith an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as\r\nthis carries the necessary implication that all future as­\r\napplied challenges to the provision must prevail. See\r\nFallon 1339–1340.\r\n  Citizens United’s as-applied challenge was not of this\r\nsort. Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention\r\nwas that BCRA §203 could not lawfully be applied to a\r\n——————\r\ninvert it.\r\n  10 Professor Fallon proposes an intricate answer to this question that\r\n\r\nthe majority ignores. Fallon 1327–1359. It bears mention that our\r\ncolleagues have previously cited Professor Fallon’s article for the exact\r\nopposite point from the one they wish to make today. In Gonzales v.\r\nCarhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007), the Court explained that “[i]t is neither\r\nour obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve\r\nquestions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation\r\nthat might develop,” and “[f]or this reason, ‘[a]s-applied challenges are\r\nthe basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.’ ” Id., at 168\r\n(opinion for the Court by KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Fallon 1328 (second\r\nalteration in original)).\r\n                      Cite as: 558 U.

It certainly would not invalidate the statute as\r\napplied to a large for-profit corporation. See Tr. of Oral\r\nArg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United\r\nemphasizing that appellant is “a small, nonprofit organi­\r\nzation, which is very much like [an MCFL corporation],”\r\nand affirming that its argument “definitely would not be\r\nthe same” if Hillary were distributed by General Motors).12\r\nThere is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial chal­\r\n——————\r\n  11 Internal   Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) applies, inter alia, to non­\r\nprofit organizations “operated exclusively for the promotion of social\r\nwelfare, . . . the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to chari­\r\ntable, educational, or recreational purposes.”\r\n   12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE is therefore much too quick when he suggests\r\n\r\nthat, “[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case\r\nthat the Act may not be applied to Citizens United—because corpora­\r\ntions as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment\r\nrights—would mean that any other corporation raising the same\r\nchallenge would also win.” Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion). That\r\nconclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens\r\nUnited’s plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implau­\r\nsible position that all corporations and all types of expenditures enjoy\r\nthe same First Amendment protections, which always trump the\r\ninterests in regulation. At times, the majority appears to endorse this\r\nextreme view. At other times, however, it appears to suggest that\r\nnonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protec­\r\ntion than for-profit corporations, see ante, at 20, 39, “advocacy” organi­\r\nzations have a better claim than other nonprofits, ante, at 20, domestic\r\ncorporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, ante, at 46–\r\n47, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations,\r\nante, at 38–40, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast\r\ncommunications, ante, at 33. The majority never uses a multinational\r\nbusiness corporation in its hypotheticals.\r\n14    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nlenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.\r\nNarrower Grounds\r\n   It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have\r\nmanufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have\r\nadvanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would\r\nfacilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corpora­\r\ntions such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes\r\nand precedents. Which is to say, the majority has trans­\r\ngressed yet another “cardinal” principle of the judicial\r\nprocess: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is neces­\r\nsary not to decide more,” PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug En\r\nforcement Admin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (Rob­\r\nerts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\r\n   Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision\r\nthat the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could\r\nhave ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length\r\nfilm distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify\r\nas an “electioneering communication” under §203 of\r\nBCRA, 2 U. S. C. §441b. BCRA defines that term to en­\r\ncompass certain communications transmitted by “broad­\r\ncast, cable, or satellite.” §434(f)(3)(A). When Congress\r\nwas developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was\r\nstill in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very\r\ndifferent sort of programming: short advertisements run\r\non television or radio. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207.\r\nThe sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC’s im­\r\nplementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on­\r\ndemand transmissions.          See Brief for Senator John\r\nMcCain et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19. In light of this\r\nambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on­\r\ndemand, and “[t]he elementary rule . . . that every reason­\r\nable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a\r\nstatute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California,\r\n155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nruled that §203 does not apply to Hillary.13\r\n   Second, the Court could have expanded the MCFL ex­\r\nemption to cover §501(c)(4) nonprofits that accept only a\r\nde minimis amount of money from for-profit corporations.\r\nCitizens United professes to be such a group: Its brief says\r\nit “is funded predominantly by donations from individuals\r\nwho support [its] ideological message.” Brief for Appellant\r\n5. Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that de minimis\r\nbusiness support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise\r\nqualifying organization from the ambit of MCFL.14 This\r\nCourt could have simply followed their lead.15\r\n   Finally, let us not forget Citizens United’s as-applied\r\nconstitutional challenge.      Precisely because Citizens\r\n——————\r\n   13 The Court entirely ignores this statutory argument. It concludes\r\n\r\nthat §203 applies to Hillary on the basis of the film’s content, ante, at\r\n7–8, without considering the possibility that §203 does not apply to\r\nvideo-on-demand transmissions generally.\r\n   14 See Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F. 3d 1137,\r\n\r\n1148 (CA10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that “every other\r\ncircuit to have addressed this issue” has done likewise); Brief for\r\nIndependent Sector as Amicus Curiae 10–11 (collecting cases). The\r\nCourt rejects this solution in part because the Government “merely\r\nsuggest[s] it” and “does not say that it agrees with the interpretation.”\r\nAnte, at 11. Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing\r\ninsufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same\r\ntime that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly\r\nabandoned. The Court also protests that a de minimis standard would\r\n“requir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.” Ante, at 12. But de\r\nminimis tests need not be intricate at all. A test that granted MCFL\r\nstatus to §501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed\r\ndollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such\r\ndonations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets,\r\nwould be perfectly easy to understand and administer.\r\n   15 Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have\r\n\r\nbeen to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA §203(c),\r\nallowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering com­\r\nmunications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace\r\nthe payments to individual contributions. See Brief for National Rifle\r\nAssociation as Amicus Curiae 5–15 (arguing forcefully that Congress\r\nintended this result).\r\n16     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nUnited looks so much like the MCFL organizations we\r\nhave exempted from regulation, while a feature-length\r\nvideo-on-demand film looks so unlike the types of electoral\r\nadvocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation, this\r\nchallenge is a substantial one. As the appellant’s own\r\narguments show, the Court could have easily limited the\r\nbreadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to\r\nadopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must\r\nalways be treated identically—and always spared expendi­\r\ntures restrictions—in the political realm. Yet the Court\r\nnonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review proc­\r\ness that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation\r\nsince Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and\r\nthat was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in\r\nWRTL, 551 U. S. 449.\r\n  This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case\r\ncould have been decided is not meant to show that any of\r\nthese grounds is ideal, though each is perfectly “valid,”\r\nante, at 12 (majority opinion).16 It is meant to show that\r\nthere were principled, narrower paths that a Court that\r\nwas serious about judicial restraint could have taken.\r\nThere was also the straightforward path: applying Austin\r\nand McConnell, just as the District Court did in holding\r\n——————\r\n  16 THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds our discussion of these narrower solutions\r\n“quite perplexing” because we suggest that the Court should “latch on\r\nto one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional\r\nquestion,” without doing the same ourselves. Ante, at 3. There is\r\nnothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly\r\nsituated to our colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view\r\nof the First Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not\r\nlead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this\r\ncase, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional\r\navoidance or to vindicate Citizens United’s as-applied challenge. Each\r\nof the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statu­\r\ntory argument the Court accepted in last year’s Voting Rights Act case,\r\nNorthwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. __\r\n(2009).\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    17\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthat the funding of Citizens United’s film can be regulated\r\nunder them. The only thing preventing the majority from\r\naffirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower\r\nground that would retain Austin, is its disdain for Austin.\r\n                              II\r\n   The final principle of judicial process that the majority\r\nviolates is the most transparent: stare decisis. I am not an\r\nabsolutist when it comes to stare decisis, in the campaign\r\nfinance area or in any other. No one is. But if this princi­\r\nple is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of\r\nlaw, it must at least demand a significant justification,\r\nbeyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning\r\nsettled doctrine. “[A] decision to overrule should rest on\r\nsome special reason over and above the belief that a prior\r\ncase was wrongly decided.” Planned Parenthood of South\r\neastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 864 (1992). No such\r\njustification exists in this case, and to the contrary there\r\nare powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our\r\nprecedents.17\r\n   The Court’s central argument for why stare decisis\r\nought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin. The\r\nopinion “was not well reasoned,” our colleagues assert, and\r\nit conflicts with First Amendment principles. Ante, at 47–\r\n48. This, of course, is the Court’s merits argument, the\r\nmany defects in which we will soon consider. I am per­\r\nfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were\r\ndead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest\r\nof our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for\r\nrevisiting it. But neither is true of Austin, as I explain at\r\nlength in Parts III and IV, infra, at 23–89, and restating a\r\nmerits argument with additional vigor does not give it\r\n——————\r\n  17 I\r\n     will have more to say shortly about the merits—about why Austin\r\nand McConnell are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and\r\nwhy their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present\r\npurposes, I limit the discussion to stare-decisis-specific considerations.\r\n18     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nextra weight in the stare decisis calculus.\r\n   Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supple­\r\nments its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The\r\nCourt proclaims that “Austin is undermined by experience\r\nsince its announcement.” Ante, at 48. This is a curious\r\nclaim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The\r\nmajority has no empirical evidence with which to substan­\r\ntiate the claim; we just have its ipse dixit that the real\r\nworld has not been kind to Austin. Nor does the majority\r\nbother to specify in what sense Austin has been “under­\r\nmined.” Instead it treats the reader to a string of non\r\nsequiturs: “Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing,”\r\nante, at 48; “[s]peakers have become adept at presenting\r\ncitizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted\r\nmessages,” ibid.; “[c]orporations . . . do not have monolithic\r\nviews,” ibid. How any of these ruminations weakens the\r\nforce of stare decisis, escapes my comprehension.18\r\n   The majority also contends that the Government’s hesi­\r\ntation to rely on Austin’s antidistortion rationale “dimin­\r\nishe[s]” “the principle of adhering to that precedent.”\r\nAnte, at 48; see also ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)\r\n(Government’s litigating position is “most importan[t]”\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   18 THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that Austin has been undermined by\r\n\r\nsubsequent dissenting opinions. Ante, at 9. Under this view, it appears\r\nthat the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of\r\nrequests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. THE CHIEF\r\nJUSTICE further suggests that Austin “is uniquely destabilizing because\r\nit threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even outside” its particular\r\nfacts, as when we applied its reasoning in McConnell. Ante, at 9. Once\r\nagain, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the\r\nmore we call it into question. For those who believe Austin was cor­\r\nrectly decided—as the Federal Government and the States have long\r\nbelieved, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since\r\nAustin have believed, and as we continue to believe—there is nothing\r\n“destabilizing” about the prospect of its continued application. It is\r\ngutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does\r\ntoday, that will be destabilizing.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    19\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nfactor undermining Austin). Why it diminishes the value\r\nof stare decisis is left unexplained. We have never thought\r\nfit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken\r\nany particular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can\r\noften be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may\r\nhave strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing\r\nonly a subset of them. Members of the public, moreover,\r\noften rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our\r\nprecise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legisla­\r\ntures that have been regulating corporate electioneering\r\nsince Austin. The task of evaluating the continued viabil­\r\nity of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.19\r\n   Although the majority opinion spends several pages\r\nmaking these surprising arguments, it says almost noth­\r\ning about the standard considerations we have used to\r\ndetermine stare decisis value, such as the antiquity of the\r\nprecedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reli­\r\nance interests at stake. It is also conspicuously silent\r\nabout McConnell, even though the McConnell Court’s\r\ndecision to uphold BCRA §203 relied not only on the anti­\r\ndistortion logic of Austin but also on the statute’s histori­\r\ncal pedigree, see, e.g., 540 U. S., at 115–132, 223–224, and\r\nthe need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns,\r\nsee id., at 126–129, 205–208, and n. 88.\r\n   We have recognized that “[s]tare decisis has special force\r\nwhen legislators or citizens ‘have acted in reliance on a\r\nprevious decision, for in this instance overruling the deci­\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   19 Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging\r\n\r\nthe historical account of campaign finance law given in United States v.\r\nAutomobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567 (1957). Ante, at 48. Austin did not\r\nso much as allude to this historical account, much less rely on it. Even\r\nif the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign\r\nfinance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than\r\nAutomobile Workers suggested, the point remains that this body of law\r\nhas played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political\r\nlife for decades upon decades.\r\n20     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nsion would dislodge settled rights and expectations or\r\nrequire an extensive legislative response.’ ” Hubbard v.\r\nUnited States, 514 U. S. 695, 714 (1995) (quoting Hilton v.\r\nSouth Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197,\r\n202 (1991)). Stare decisis protects not only personal rights\r\ninvolving property or contract but also the ability of the\r\nelected branches to shape their laws in an effective and\r\ncoherent fashion. Today’s decision takes away a power\r\nthat we have long permitted these branches to exercise.\r\nState legislatures have relied on their authority to regu­\r\nlate corporate electioneering, confirmed in Austin, for\r\nmore than a century.20 The Federal Congress has relied\r\non this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it\r\nspecifically relied on Austin throughout the years it spent\r\ndeveloping and debating BCRA. The total record it com­\r\npiled was 100,000 pages long.21 Pulling out the rug be­\r\nneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of\r\n§203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal\r\nbranch.\r\n   By removing one of its central components, today’s\r\nruling makes a hash out of BCRA’s “delicate and intercon­\r\nnected regulatory scheme.” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 172.\r\nConsider just one example of the distortions that will\r\nfollow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from\r\nsoliciting or spending “soft money,” funds that are not\r\nsubject to the statute’s disclosure requirements or its\r\nsource and amount limitations. 2 U. S. C. §441i; McCon\r\nnell, 540 U. S., at 122–126.

The\r\nCourt’s ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of\r\ncorporations and unions—and the narrow interests they\r\nrepresent—vis-à-vis the role of political parties—and the\r\nbroad coalitions they represent—in determining who will\r\nhold public office.22\r\n   Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other stare\r\ndecisis factors also cut against the Court. Considerations\r\nof antiquity are significant for similar reasons. McConnell\r\nis only six years old, but Austin has been on the books for\r\ntwo decades, and many of the statutes called into question\r\nby today’s opinion have been on the books for a half­\r\ncentury or more. The Court points to no intervening\r\nchange in circumstances that warrants revisiting Austin.\r\nCertainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided\r\nWRTL two Terms ago. And the Court gives no reason to\r\nthink that Austin and McConnell are unworkable.\r\n   In fact, no one has argued to us that Austin’s rule has\r\nproved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corpora­\r\ntion, union, or State has asked us to overrule it. Quite to\r\nthe contrary, leading groups representing the business\r\ncommunity,23 organized labor,24 and the nonprofit sector,25\r\ntogether with more than half of the States,26 urge that we\r\n——————\r\n   22 To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the\r\n\r\nimbalance by removing BCRA’s soft-money limits. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg.\r\n24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of KENNEDY, J.). But this is no response to any\r\nlegislature that takes campaign finance regulation seriously.

As for McConnell, the portions of BCRA\r\nit upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Govern­\r\nment have worked to make §203 as user-friendly as possi­\r\nble. For instance, Congress established a special mecha­\r\nnism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see\r\nnote following 2 U. S. C. §437h; the FEC has established a\r\nstandardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors,\r\nfor corporations to claim that a particular electioneering\r\ncommunication is permissible under WRTL, see 11 CFR\r\n§114.15 (2009);27 and, as noted above, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\r\ncrafted his controlling opinion in WRTL with the express\r\ngoal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 469–470, 473–474. The case for stare decisis may be\r\nbolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings “have\r\nreduced the impact” of a precedent “while reaffirming the\r\ndecision’s core ruling.” Dickerson v.

Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 305 (2004) (plurality opinion). As a\r\ngeneral matter, this principle is a sound one. But the principle only\r\ntakes on real force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal\r\ndemocratic process; it is the fear of making “mistakes [that] cannot be\r\ncorrected by Congress,” ibid., that motivates us to review constitutional\r\nprecedents with a more critical eye. Austin and McConnell did not\r\nobstruct state or congressional legislative power in any way. Although\r\nit is unclear how high a bar today’s decision will pose to future at­\r\ntempts to regulate corporate electioneering, it will clearly restrain\r\nmuch legislative action.\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nnell comes down to nothing more than its disagreement\r\nwith their results. Virtually every one of its arguments\r\nwas made and rejected in those cases, and the majority\r\nopinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated\r\ndissents. The only relevant thing that has changed since\r\nAustin and McConnell is the composition of this Court.\r\nToday’s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of stare decisis,\r\n“the means by which we ensure that the law will not\r\nmerely change erratically, but will develop in a principled\r\nand intelligible fashion” that “permits society to presume\r\nthat bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than\r\nin the proclivities of individuals.” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474\r\nU. S. 254, 265 (1986).\r\n                            III\r\n  The novelty of the Court’s procedural dereliction and its\r\napproach to stare decisis is matched by the novelty of its\r\nruling on the merits. The ruling rests on several premises.\r\nFirst, the Court claims that Austin and McConnell have\r\n“banned” corporate speech. Second, it claims that the\r\nFirst Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based\r\non speaker identity, including the speaker’s identity as a\r\ncorporation. Third, it claims that Austin and McConnell\r\nwere radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition\r\nand our campaign finance jurisprudence. Each of these\r\nclaims is wrong.\r\nThe So-Called “Ban”\r\n  Pervading the Court’s analysis is the ominous image of\r\na “categorical ba[n]” on corporate speech.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\npointed out that, “[c]ontrary to the [majority’s] critical\r\nassumptions,” the statutes upheld in Austin and McCon\r\nnell do “not impose an absolute ban on all forms of corpo­\r\nrate political spending.” Austin, 494 U. S., at 660; see also\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 203–204; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at\r\n162–163. For starters, both statutes provide exemptions\r\nfor PACs, separate segregated funds established by a\r\ncorporation for political purposes.         See 2 U. S. C.\r\n§441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §169.255 (West\r\n2005). “The ability to form and administer separate seg­\r\nregated funds,” we observed in McConnell, “has provided\r\ncorporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient\r\nopportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been\r\nthis Court’s unanimous view.” 540 U. S., at 203.\r\n   Under BCRA, any corporation’s “stockholders and their\r\nfamilies and its executive or administrative personnel and\r\ntheir families” can pool their resources to finance election­\r\neering communications. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(4)(A)(i). A\r\nsignificant and growing number of corporations avail\r\nthemselves of this option;29 during the most recent election\r\ncycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion\r\ndollars.30 Administering a PAC entails some administra­\r\ntive burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer,\r\ndisclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court\r\ntoday upholds, see ante, at 51, and no one has suggested\r\nthat the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit\r\ncorporation.

The majority finds the PAC option inadequate\r\nin part because “[a] PAC is a separate association from the corpora­\r\ntion.” Ante, at 21. The formal “separateness” of PACs from their host\r\ncorporations—which administer and control the PACs but which cannot\r\nfunnel general treasury funds into them or force members to support\r\nthem—is, of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Like all other natural persons, every shareholder\r\nof every corporation remains entirely free under Austin\r\nand McConnell to do however much electioneering she\r\npleases outside of the corporate form. The owners of a\r\n“mom & pop” store can simply place ads in their own\r\nnames, rather than the store’s. If ideologically aligned\r\nindividuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through\r\nthe corporate form, they may utilize an MCFL organiza­\r\ntion that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit\r\nfor business or union interests. See MCFL, 479 U. S., at\r\n263–264.\r\n   The laws upheld in Austin and McConnell leave open\r\nmany additional avenues for corporations’ political speech.\r\nConsider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evalu­\r\nating in this case, BCRA §203. It has no application to\r\ngenuine issue advertising—a category of corporate speech\r\nCongress found to be far more substantial than election­\r\nrelated advertising, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207—or\r\nto Internet, telephone, and print advocacy.31 Like numer­\r\n——————\r\n  31 Roaming far afield from the case at hand, the majority worries that\r\n\r\nthe Government will use §203 to ban books, pamphlets, and blogs.\r\nAnte, at 20, 33, 49. Yet by its plain terms, §203 does not apply to\r\nprinted material. See 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3)(A)(i); see also 11 CFR\r\n§100.29(c)(1) (“[E]lectioneering communication does not include com­\r\nmunications appearing in print media”). And in light of the ordinary\r\nunderstanding of the terms “broadcast, cable, [and] satellite,”\r\n§434(f)(3)(A)(i), coupled with Congress’ clear aim of targeting “a virtual\r\ntorrent of televised election-related ads,” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207,\r\nwe highly doubt that §203 could be interpreted to apply to a Web site or\r\nbook that happens to be transmitted at some stage over airwaves or\r\ncable lines, or that the FEC would ever try to do so. See 11 CFR\r\n§100.26 (exempting most Internet communications from regulation as\r\nadvertising); §100.155 (exempting uncompensated Internet activity\r\nfrom regulation as an expenditure); Supp. Brief for Center for Inde­\r\npendent Media et al. as Amici Curiae 14 (explaining that “the FEC has\r\n26     CITIZENS UNITED v.

It applies in\r\na viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy\r\nmessages about clearly identified candidates for federal\r\noffice, made during discrete time periods through discrete\r\nchannels. In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed\r\nto do to broadcast Hillary right before the primary was to\r\nabjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC,\r\nwhich by its own account is “one of the most active conser­\r\nvative PACs in America,” Citizens United Political Victory\r\n——————\r\n  37 §441b(b)(2)(C).\r\n  38 WRTL,   551 U.

S. 51, 57\r\n(1965)). The FEC’s business is to administer and enforce the campaign\r\nfinance laws. The regulatory body at issue in Freedman was a state\r\nBoard of Censors that had virtually unfettered discretion to bar distri­\r\nbution of motion picture films it deemed not to be “moral and proper.”\r\nSee id., at 52–53, and n. 2. No movie could be shown in the State of\r\nMaryland that was not first approved and licensed by the Board of\r\nCensors. Id., at 52, n. 1. It is an understatement to say that Freedman\r\nis not on point, and the majority’s characterization of the FEC is deeply\r\ndisconcerting.\r\n28     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Laws such as §203 target a class of\r\ncommunications that is especially likely to corrupt the\r\npolitical process, that is at least one degree removed from\r\nthe views of individual citizens, and that may not even\r\nreflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden\r\npolitical speech, and that is always a serious matter,\r\ndemanding careful scrutiny. But the majority’s incessant\r\ntalk of a “ban” aims at a straw man.\r\nIdentity-Based Distinctions\r\n  The second pillar of the Court’s opinion is its assertion\r\nthat “the Government cannot restrict political speech\r\nbased on the speaker’s . . . identity.” Ante, at 30; accord,\r\nante, at 1, 24, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 49, 50.

As I shall explain,\r\ninfra, at 52–55, the holding in that case was far narrower\r\nthan the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfettered\r\ndiscourse, the Court’s denunciation of identity-based\r\ndistinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures\r\nreality.\r\n  “Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected\r\nan absolutist interpretation” of the First Amendment.\r\nWRTL, 551 U.

Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that\r\nspeech can be regulated differentially on account of the\r\nspeaker’s identity, when identity is understood in cate­\r\ngorical or institutional terms. The Government routinely\r\nplaces special restrictions on the speech rights of stu­\r\ndents,41 prisoners,42 members of the Armed Forces,43 for­\r\neigners,44 and its own employees.45 When such restric­\r\ntions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest,\r\nthey do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.46 In\r\n——————\r\n  41 See, e.g., Bethel School Dist.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ncontrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses,\r\nour cases recognize that the Government’s interests may\r\nbe more or less compelling with respect to different classes\r\nof speakers,47 cf. Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Min\r\nnesota Comm’r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585 (1983)\r\n(“[D]ifferential treatment” is constitutionally suspect\r\n“unless justified by some special characteristic” of the\r\nregulated class of speakers (emphasis added)), and that\r\nthe constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers,\r\nin certain contexts, “ ‘are not automatically coextensive\r\nwith the rights’ ” that are normally accorded to members of\r\nour society, Morse v. Frederick, 551 U. S. 393, 396–397,\r\n404 (2007) (quoting Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser,\r\n478 U. S. 675, 682 (1986)).\r\n   The free speech guarantee thus does not render every\r\nother public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a\r\nspeaker’s autonomy; society could scarcely function if it\r\ndid. It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine\r\nhas “frowned on” certain identity-based distinctions, Los\r\nAngeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp.,\r\n——————\r\ncause they “stand only for the proposition that there are certain gov­\r\nernmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on\r\nparticular kinds of speech.” Ante, at 25. The majority’s creative sug­\r\ngestion that these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite\r\nimplausible. In any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case,\r\nas Congress and half the state legislatures have concluded, over many\r\ndecades, that their core functions of administering elections and pass­\r\ning legislation cannot operate effectively without some narrow restric­\r\ntions on corporate electioneering paid for by general treasury funds.\r\n   47 Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity\r\n\r\nand incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his\r\nspeech. See Aristotle, Poetics 43–44 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (“In\r\nevaluating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just\r\nthe moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the iden­\r\ntity of the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and\r\nthe motive”). The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper\r\nsubject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer\r\nand disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have\r\nprohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or\r\ncontent.

These statutes burden the political expression of\r\none class of speakers, namely, civil servants. Yet we have\r\nsustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and\r\nCongress’ reasoned judgment that certain regulations\r\nwhich leave “untouched full participation . . . in political\r\ndecisions at the ballot box,” Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter\r\nCarriers, 413 U. S. 548, 556 (1973) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted), help ensure that public officials are “suffi­\r\nciently free from improper influences,” id., at 564, and\r\nthat “confidence in the system of representative Govern­\r\nment is not . . . eroded to a disastrous extent,” id., at 565.\r\n   The same logic applies to this case with additional force\r\nbecause it is the identity of corporations, rather than\r\nindividuals, that the Legislature has taken into account.\r\nAs we have unanimously observed, legislatures are enti­\r\ntled to decide “that the special characteristics of the corpo­\r\nrate structure require particularly careful regulation” in\r\nan electoral context. NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209–210.50 Not\r\nonly has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt\r\nthe electoral process long been recognized, but within the\r\narea of campaign finance, corporate spending is also “fur­\r\nthest from the core of political expression, since corpora­\r\ntions’ First Amendment speech and association interests\r\nare derived largely from those of their members and of the\r\npublic in receiving information,” Beaumont, 539 U. S., at\r\n161, n. 8 (citation omitted).

Fur­\r\nthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished\r\nfrom noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that\r\nregulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimina­\r\ntion or political favoritism.\r\n   If taken seriously, our colleagues’ assumption that the\r\nidentity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government’s\r\nability to regulate political speech would lead to some\r\nremarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have\r\naccorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by\r\n“Tokyo Rose” during World War II the same protection as\r\nspeech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would\r\nappear to afford the same protection to multinational\r\ncorporations controlled by foreigners as to individual\r\nAmericans: To do otherwise, after all, could “ ‘enhance the\r\nrelative voice’ ” of some (i.e., humans) over others (i.e.,\r\nnonhumans).

Such measures have been a part of U. S. campaign finance law\r\nfor many years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to\r\ndistinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering\r\nwould certainly have surprised the Framers, whose “obsession with\r\nforeign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individu­\r\nals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country.”\r\nTeachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.

Only the most wooden approach to the\r\nFirst Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it\r\nseeks to draw.\r\nOur First Amendment Tradition\r\n  A third fulcrum of the Court’s opinion is the idea that\r\nAustin and McConnell are radical outliers, “aberration[s],”\r\nin our First Amendment tradition.

The Court invokes\r\n“ancient First Amendment principles,” ante, at 1 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted), and original understandings,\r\nante, at 37–38, to defend today’s ruling, yet it makes only\r\na perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the princi­\r\nples or understandings of those who drafted and ratified\r\nthe Amendment.

Those few corporations that existed at the found­\r\ning were authorized by grant of a special legislative char­\r\nter.53 Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature,\r\nand the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter\r\nthat specified the corporation’s powers and purposes and\r\n“authoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate\r\norganization,” including “the internal structure of the\r\n——————\r\n  53 Scholars  have found that only a handful of business corporations\r\nwere issued charters during the colonial period, and only a few hundred\r\nduring all of the 18th century.

JUSTICE SCALIA\r\nquibbles with these figures; whereas we say that “a few hundred”\r\ncharters were issued to business corporations during the 18th century,\r\nhe says that the number is “approximately 335.” Ante, at 2 (concurring\r\nopinion). JUSTICE SCALIA also raises the more serious point that it is\r\nimproper to assess these figures by today’s standards, ante, at 3,\r\nthough I believe he fails to substantiate his claim that “the corporation\r\nwas a familiar figure in American economic life” by the century’s end,\r\nibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). His formulation of that claim\r\nis also misleading, because the relevant reference point is not 1800 but\r\nthe date of the First Amendment’s ratification, in 1791. And at that\r\ntime, the number of business charters must have been significantly\r\nsmaller than 335, because the pace of chartering only began to pick up\r\nsteam in the last decade of the 18th century.

Unlike our colleagues, they had little\r\ntrouble distinguishing corporations from human beings,\r\nand when they constitutionalized the right to free speech\r\nin the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individ­\r\nual Americans that they had in mind.55 While individuals\r\nmight join together to exercise their speech rights, busi­\r\nness corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facili­\r\ntating such associational or expressive ends. Even “the\r\nnotion that business corporations could invoke the First\r\nAmendment would probably have been quite a novelty,”\r\ngiven that “at the time, the legitimacy of every corporate\r\nactivity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the\r\nsovereign.” Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate\r\nSpeech, 18 Hastings Const.

Speech was given\r\nto man by his Creator for the noblest purposes”). Indeed, it has been\r\n“claimed that the notion of institutional speech . . . did not exist in post­\r\nrevolutionary America.” Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment\r\nSpeakers, 100 Nw. U. L.

Given that corporations\r\nwere conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical\r\ncapacity to “speak,” the burden of establishing that the Framers and\r\nratifiers understood “the freedom of speech” to encompass corporate\r\nspeech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.\r\n38    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n(1819) (Marshall, C. J.) (“A corporation is an artificial\r\nbeing, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contem­\r\nplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it pos­\r\nsesses only those properties which the charter of its crea­\r\ntion confers upon it”); Eule, Promoting Speaker Diversity:\r\nAustin and Metro Broadcasting, 1990 S.

What is compelling,\r\nhowever, is an understanding of who was supposed to be\r\nthe beneficiary of the free speech guaranty—the individ­\r\nual”). In light of these background practices and under­\r\nstandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers\r\nbelieved “the freedom of speech” would extend equally to\r\nall corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude\r\nlegislatures from taking limited measures to guard\r\nagainst corporate capture of elections.\r\n   The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse\r\nintellectual sources, communicated through newspapers,\r\nand aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had\r\nexisted in England. Ante, at 37. From these (accurate)\r\nobservations, the Court concludes that “[t]he First\r\nAmendment was certainly not understood to condone the\r\nsuppression of political speech in society’s most salient\r\nmedia.” Ibid. This conclusion is far from certain, given\r\nthat many historians believe the Framers were focused on\r\nprior restraints on publication and did not understand the\r\nFirst Amendment to “prevent the subsequent punishment\r\nof such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the\r\npublic welfare.” Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S.\r\n697, 714 (1931). Yet, even if the majority’s conclusion\r\nwere correct, it would tell us only that the First Amend­\r\nment was understood to protect political speech in certain\r\nmedia. It would tell us little about whether the Amend­\r\nment was understood to protect general treasury election­\r\neering expenditures by corporations, and to what extent.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

As a matter of original\r\nmeaning, it likewise seems baseless—unless one evaluates\r\nthe First Amendment’s “principles,” ante, at 1, 48, or its\r\n“purpose,” ante, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), at such a\r\nhigh level of generality that the historical understandings\r\nof the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on\r\nthe judicial task. This case sheds a revelatory light on the\r\nassumption of some that an impartial judge’s application\r\nof an originalist methodology is likely to yield more deter­\r\nminate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the\r\ndecisional process, than his or her views about sound\r\npolicy.\r\n   JUSTICE SCALIA criticizes the foregoing discussion for\r\nfailing to adduce statements from the founding era show­\r\ning that corporations were understood to be excluded from\r\nthe First Amendment’s free speech guarantee. Ante, at 1–\r\n2, 9. Of course, JUSTICE SCALIA adduces no statements to\r\nsuggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that\r\nthe contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right\r\nthat the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause\r\nthought they were enshrining. Although JUSTICE SCALIA\r\nmakes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual’s\r\nright to speak entails a right to speak with others for a\r\ncommon cause, cf. MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, he does not ex­\r\nplain why those two rights must be precisely identical, or\r\nwhy that principle applies to electioneering by corpora­\r\ntions that serve no “common cause.” Ante, at 8. Nothing\r\nin his account dislodges my basic point that members of\r\nthe founding generation held a cautious view of corporate\r\npower and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they\r\n“despised” corporations, ante, at 2), and that they concep­\r\ntualized speech in individualistic terms. If no prominent\r\nFramer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would\r\n40     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nhave lesser status than individual speech, that may well\r\nbe because the contrary proposition—if not also the very\r\nnotion of “corporate speech”—was inconceivable.56\r\n   JUSTICE SCALIA also emphasizes the unqualified nature\r\nof the First Amendment text. Ante, at 2, 8. Yet he would\r\nseemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could\r\nhe claim that my purported views on newspapers must\r\ntrack my views on corporations generally? Ante, at 6.57\r\nLike virtually all modern lawyers, JUSTICE SCALIA pre­\r\nsumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the\r\nExecutive, even though its language refers to Congress\r\nalone. In any event, the text only leads us back to the\r\nquestions who or what is guaranteed “the freedom of\r\nspeech,” and, just as critically, what that freedom consists\r\nof and under what circumstances it may be limited.\r\nJUSTICE SCALIA appears to believe that because corpora­\r\ntions are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as\r\n——————\r\n   56 Postratification practice bolsters the conclusion that the First\r\n\r\nAmendment, “as originally understood,” ante, at 37, did not give corpo­\r\nrations political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals.\r\nWell into the modern era of general incorporation statutes, “[t]he\r\ncommon law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate politi­\r\ncal participation,” First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\r\n819 (1978) (White, J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize any\r\nFirst Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of\r\nthe 20th century, see ante, at 25–26 (listing cases).\r\n   57 In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against JUSTICE\r\n\r\nSCALIA, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the\r\nFirst Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between\r\ntypes of “speakers,” or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court’s\r\nstrongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers’ views on the\r\npress, see ante, at 37–38; ante, at 4–6 (SCALIA, J., concurring), yet while\r\nthe Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the\r\nFree Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and\r\nhistory highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corpora­\r\ntion, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special\r\nFirst Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of “identity”­\r\nbased distinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that\r\nmuch, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

See ante, at 7–8. That conclu­\r\nsion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and\r\nJUSTICE SCALIA fails to explain why the original public\r\nmeaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.\r\n   The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as\r\nBCRA §203 meshes with the original meaning of the First\r\nAmendment.58 I have given several reasons why I believe\r\nthe Constitution would have been understood then, and\r\nought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restric­\r\ntions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many\r\nmore reasons in the pages to come. The Court enlists the\r\nFramers in its defense without seriously grappling with\r\ntheir understandings of corporations or the free speech\r\nright, or with the republican principles that underlay\r\nthose understandings.\r\n   In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has\r\nnever attended very closely to the views of the Framers,\r\nsee Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 280 (2006) (STEVENS,\r\nJ., dissenting), whose political universe differed pro­\r\nfoundly from that of today. We have long since held that\r\ncorporations are covered by the First Amendment, and\r\nmany legal scholars have long since rejected the conces­\r\nsion theory of the corporation. But “historical context is\r\nusually relevant,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omit­\r\nted), and in light of the Court’s effort to cast itself as\r\nguardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that\r\nnothing in our constitutional history dictates today’s\r\noutcome. To the contrary, this history helps illuminate\r\njust how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  58 Cf.L.

Legislative and Judicial Interpretation\r\n   A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion\r\nthat today’s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment\r\ntradition. At the federal level, the express distinction\r\nbetween corporate and individual political spending on\r\nelections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed\r\nthe Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corpo­\r\nrate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on\r\nthe legislation observed that “[t]he evils of the use of\r\n[corporate] money in connection with political elections are\r\nso generally recognized that the committee deems it un­\r\nnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general\r\npurpose of this measure. It is in the interest of good gov­\r\nernment and calculated to promote purity in the selection\r\nof public officials.” S. Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.,\r\n2 (1906). President Roosevelt, in his 1905 annual message\r\nto Congress, declared:\r\n     “ ‘All contributions by corporations to any political\r\n     committee or for any political purpose should be for­\r\n     bidden by law; directors should not be permitted to\r\n     use stockholders’ money for such purposes; and, more­\r\n     over, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it\r\n     went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed\r\n     at in corrupt practices acts.’ ” United States v. Auto\r\n     mobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 572 (1957) (quoting 40\r\n     Cong. Rec. 96).\r\n  The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the\r\nTillman Act several times, see WRTL, 551 U.

It is enough to say that the\r\nAct was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first,\r\nthe enormous power corporations had come to wield in\r\nfederal elections, with the accompanying threat of both\r\nactual corruption and a public perception of corruption;\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Justice Souter recently traced these devel­\r\nopments at length.59 WRTL, 551 U. S., at 507–519 (dis­\r\nsenting opinion); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 115–\r\n133; McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 188–205. The Taft-\r\nHartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case.\r\nIn that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress\r\nextended the prohibition on corporate support of candi­\r\ndates to cover not only direct contributions, but independ­\r\nent expenditures as well.

Ante, at 27–28. Two features of these\r\ncases are of far greater relevance. First, those Justices\r\nwere writing separately; which is to say, their position\r\nfailed to command a majority. Prior to today, this was a\r\nfact we found significant in evaluating precedents. Sec­\r\nond, each case in this line expressed support for the prin­\r\nciple that corporate and union political speech financed\r\nwith PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organiza­\r\ntion’s stockholders or members, receives greater protection\r\nthan speech financed with general treasury funds.60\r\n——————\r\n  60 See Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 409, 414–415 (1972)\r\n(reading the statutory bar on corporate and union campaign spending\r\nnot to apply to “the voluntary donations of employees,” when main­\r\ntained in a separate account, because “[t]he dominant [legislative]\r\nconcern in requiring that contributions be voluntary was, after all, to\r\nprotect the dissenting stockholder or union member”); Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 592 (advising the District Court to consider on\r\nremand whether the broadcast in question was “paid for out of the\r\ngeneral dues of the union membership or [whether] the funds [could] be\r\nfairly said to have obtained on a voluntary basis”); United States v.\r\nCIO, 335 U. S. 106, 123 (1948) (observing that “funds voluntarily\r\ncontributed [by union members or corporate stockholders] for election\r\npurposes” might not be covered by the expenditure bar). Both the\r\nPipefitters and the Automobile Workers Court approvingly referenced\r\nCongress’ goal of reducing “the effect of aggregated wealth on federal\r\nelections,” understood as wealth drawn from a corporate or union\r\ngeneral treasury without the stockholders’ or members’ “free and\r\nknowing choice.” Pipefitters, 407 U. S., at 416; see Automobile Workers,\r\n352 U. S., at 582.\r\n  The two dissenters in Pipefitters would not have read the statutory\r\nprovision in question, a successor to §304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, to\r\nallow such robust use of corporate and union funds to finance otherwise\r\nprohibited electioneering. “This opening of the door to extensive\r\ncorporate and union influence on the elective and legislative processes,”\r\nJustice Powell wrote, “must be viewed with genuine concern. This\r\nseems to me to be a regressive step as contrasted with the numerous\r\nlegislative and judicial actions in recent years designed to assure that\r\nelections are indeed free and representative.” 407 U.

S. C.\r\n§441b(a). FECA codified the option for corporations and\r\nunions to create PACs to finance contributions and expen­\r\nditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself.\r\n§441b(b).\r\n   By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on\r\ncorporate contributions and expenditures had become such\r\nan accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation\r\nthat when a large number of plaintiffs, including several\r\nnonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of\r\nthe Act in Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, no one even bothered to\r\nargue that the bar as such was unconstitutional. Buckley\r\nfamously (or infamously) distinguished direct contribu­\r\ntions from independent expenditures, id., at 58–59, but its\r\nsilence on corporations only reinforced the understanding\r\nthat corporate expenditures could be treated differently\r\nfrom individual expenditures. “Since our decision in Buck\r\nley, Congress’ power to prohibit corporations and unions\r\nfrom using funds in their treasuries to finance advertise­\r\nments expressly advocating the election or defeat of candi­\r\ndates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our\r\nlaw.” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 203.\r\n   Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that\r\nCongress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting\r\nnonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist\r\nwrote for a unanimous Court that Congress’ “careful legis­\r\nlative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cau­\r\ntious advance, step by step, to account for the particular\r\nlegal and economic attributes of corporations . . . warrants\r\nconsiderable deference,” and “reflects a permissible as­\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nof Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.

S., at 209 (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted). “The governmen­\r\ntal interest in preventing both actual corruption and the\r\nappearance of corruption of elected representatives has\r\nlong been recognized,” the unanimous Court observed,\r\n“and there is no reason why it may not . . . be accom­\r\nplished by treating . . . corporations . . . differently from\r\nindividuals.” Id., at 210–211.\r\n  The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned\r\nby the Court’s disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the\r\nexpenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of\r\nnonprofit corporation. In MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, we stated\r\nagain “that ‘the special characteristics of the corporate\r\nstructure require particularly careful regulation,’ ” id., at\r\n256 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209–210), and again we\r\nacknowledged that the Government has a legitimate\r\ninterest in “regulat[ing] the substantial aggregations of\r\nwealth amassed by the special advantages which go with\r\nthe corporate form,” 479 U. S., at 257 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). Those aggregations can distort the “free\r\ntrade in ideas” crucial to candidate elections, ibid., at the\r\nexpense of members or shareholders who may disagree\r\nwith the object of the expenditures, id., at 260 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). What the Court held by a 5-to­\r\n4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be\r\nallowed to use their general treasury funds for independ­\r\nent expenditures, because Congress’ interests in protect­\r\ning shareholders and “restrict[ing] ‘the influence of politi­\r\ncal war chests funneled through the corporate form,’ ” id.,\r\nat 257 (quoting FEC v. National Conservative Political\r\nAction Comm., 470 U.

They would have recognized congressional authority\r\nto bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even\r\nby this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that “the\r\nthreat from corporate political activity will vary depending\r\non the particular characteristics of a given corporation,”\r\nbut believed these “distinctions among corporations” were\r\n“distinctions in degree,” not “in kind,” and thus “more\r\nproperly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.”\r\n479 U. S., at 268 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Not a single Justice suggested\r\nthat regulation of corporate political speech could be no\r\nmore stringent than of speech by an individual.\r\n   Four years later, in Austin, 494 U. S. 652, we considered\r\nwhether corporations falling outside the MCFL exception\r\ncould be barred from using general treasury funds to make\r\nindependent expenditures in support of, or in opposition\r\nto, candidates. We held they could be. Once again recog­\r\nnizing the importance of “the integrity of the marketplace\r\nof political ideas” in candidate elections, MCFL, 479 U. S.,\r\nat 257, we noted that corporations have “special advan­\r\ntages—such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favor­\r\nable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of\r\nassets,” 494 U. S., at 658–659—that allow them to spend\r\nprodigious general treasury sums on campaign messages\r\n\r\n——————\r\nthey had to be formed “for the express purpose of promoting political\r\nideas,” so that their resources reflected political support rather than\r\ncommercial success. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264. Next, they had to have\r\nno shareholders, so that “persons connected with the organization will\r\nhave no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree\r\nwith its political activity.” Ibid. Finally, they could not be “established\r\nby a business corporation or a labor union,” nor “accept contributions\r\nfrom such entities,” lest they “serv[e] as conduits for the type of direct\r\nspending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.” Ibid.\r\n48     CITIZENS UNITED v.

In light of the corrupting\r\neffects such spending might have on the political process,\r\nibid., we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corpo­\r\nrate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations’\r\nPACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus\r\n“reflect actual public support for the political ideals es­\r\npoused by corporations,” ibid. Notwithstanding our col­\r\nleagues’ insinuations that Austin deprived the public of\r\ngeneral “ideas,” “facts,” and “knowledge,” ante, at 38–39,\r\nthe decision addressed only candidate-focused expendi­\r\ntures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate\r\nspending on other matters.\r\n  In the 20 years since Austin, we have reaffirmed its\r\nholding and rationale a number of times, see, e.g., Beau\r\nmont, 539 U. S., at 153–156, most importantly in McCon\r\nnell, 540 U. S. 93, where we upheld the provision chal­\r\nlenged here, §203 of BCRA.62 Congress crafted §203 in\r\nresponse to a problem created by Buckley. The Buckley\r\n——————\r\n  62 According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, we are “erroneou[s]” in claiming\r\n\r\nthat McConnell and Beaumont “ ‘reaffirmed’ ” Austin. Ante, at 5. In\r\nboth cases, the Court explicitly relied on Austin and quoted from it at\r\nlength. See 540 U. S., at 204–205; 539 U.

S., at 80, i.e., state­\r\nments containing so-called “magic words” like “ ‘vote for,’\r\n‘elect,’ ‘support,’ ‘cast your ballot for,’ ‘Smith for Congress,’\r\n‘vote against,’ ‘defeat,’ [or] ‘reject,’ ” id., at 43–44, and n.\r\n52. After Buckley, corporations and unions figured out\r\nhow to circumvent the limits on express advocacy by using\r\nsham “issue ads” that “eschewed the use of magic words”\r\nbut nonetheless “advocate[d] the election or defeat of\r\nclearly identified federal candidates.” McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 126. “Corporations and unions spent hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these\r\nads.” Id., at 127. Congress passed §203 to address this\r\ncircumvention, prohibiting corporations and unions from\r\nusing general treasury funds for electioneering communi­\r\ncations that “refe[r] to a clearly identified candidate,”\r\nwhether or not those communications use the magic words.\r\n2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I).\r\n   When we asked in McConnell “whether a compelling\r\ngovernmental interest justifie[d]” §203, we found the\r\nquestion “easily answered”: “We have repeatedly sustained\r\nlegislation aimed at ‘the corrosive and distorting effects of\r\nimmense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated\r\nwith the help of the corporate form and that have little or\r\nno correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s\r\npolitical ideas.’ ” 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin, 494\r\nU. S., at 660). These precedents “represent respect for the\r\nlegislative judgment that the special characteristics of the\r\ncorporate structure require particularly careful regula­\r\ntion.” 540 U. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks omit­\r\nted). “Moreover, recent cases have recognized that certain\r\nrestrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly\r\nhedge against ‘ “circumvention of [valid] contribution\r\n50    CITIZENS UNITED v.

Colorado Republican Federal Cam\r\npaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 456, and n. 18 (2001) (Colo\r\nrado II); alteration in original). BCRA, we found, is faith­\r\nful to the compelling governmental interests in\r\n“ ‘preserving the integrity of the electoral process, prevent­\r\ning corruption, . . . sustaining the active, alert responsibil­\r\nity of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise\r\nconduct of the government,’ ” and maintaining “ ‘the indi­\r\nvidual citizen’s confidence in government.’ ” 540 U.

S., at 788–789;\r\nsome internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\r\nWhat made the answer even easier than it might have\r\nbeen otherwise was the option to form PACs, which give\r\ncorporations, at the least, “a constitutionally sufficient\r\nopportunity to engage in” independent expenditures. 540\r\nU. S., at 203.\r\n                  3. Buckley and Bellotti\r\n   Against this extensive background of congressional\r\nregulation of corporate campaign spending, and our re­\r\npeated affirmation of this regulation as constitutionally\r\nsound, the majority dismisses Austin as “a significant\r\ndeparture from ancient First Amendment principles,”\r\nante, at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted). How does\r\nthe majority attempt to justify this claim? Selected pas­\r\nsages from two cases, Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, and Bellotti,\r\n435 U. S. 765, do all of the work. In the Court’s view,\r\nBuckley and Bellotti decisively rejected the possibility of\r\ndistinguishing corporations from natural persons in the\r\n1970’s; it just so happens that in every single case in\r\nwhich the Court has reviewed campaign finance legisla­\r\ntion in the decades since, the majority failed to grasp this\r\ntruth. The Federal Congress and dozens of state legisla­\r\ntures, we now know, have been similarly deluded.\r\n   The majority emphasizes Buckley’s statement that\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           51\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n“ ‘[t]he concept that government may restrict the speech of\r\nsome elements of our society in order to enhance the rela­\r\ntive voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amend­\r\nment.’ ” Ante, at 33 (quoting 424 U. S., at 48–49); ante, at\r\n8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). But this elegant phrase\r\ncannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on\r\nit. For one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit\r\nnumerous “restrictions on the speech of some in order to\r\nprevent a few from drowning out the many”: for example,\r\nrestrictions on ballot access and on legislators’ floor time.\r\nNixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\r\n402 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring). For another, the\r\nBuckley Court used this line in evaluating “the ancillary\r\ngovernmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of\r\nindividuals and groups to influence the outcome of elec­\r\ntions.” 424 U. S., at 48. It is not apparent why this is\r\nrelevant to the case before us. The majority suggests that\r\nAustin rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization,\r\nante, at 34; ante, at 8–10 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), but\r\nwe made it clear in Austin (as in several cases before and\r\nsince) that a restriction on the way corporations spend\r\ntheir money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of\r\nsome elements of our society in preference to others.\r\nIndeed, we expressly ruled that the compelling interest\r\nsupporting Michigan’s statute was not one of “ ‘equaliz[ing]\r\nthe relative influence of speakers on elections,’ ” Austin,\r\n494 U. S., at 660 (quoting id., at 705 (KENNEDY, J., dis­\r\nsenting)), but rather the need to confront the distinctive\r\ncorrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy fi­\r\nnanced by general treasury dollars, id., at 659–660.\r\n    For that matter, it should go without saying that when\r\nwe made this statement in Buckley, we could not have\r\nbeen casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expendi­\r\ntures in candidate elections, which had not been chal­\r\nlenged as “foreign to the First Amendment,” ante, at 33\r\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49), or for any other reason.\r\n52    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nBuckley’s independent expenditure analysis was focused\r\non a very different statutory provision, 18 U. S. C.\r\n§608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V). It is implausible to think,\r\nas the majority suggests, ante, at 29–30, that Buckley\r\ncovertly invalidated FECA’s separate corporate and union\r\ncampaign expenditure restriction, §610 (now codified at 2\r\nU. S. C. §441b), even though that restriction had been on\r\nthe books for decades before Buckley and would remain on\r\nthe books, undisturbed, for decades after.\r\n  The case on which the majority places even greater\r\nweight than Buckley, however, is Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\r\nclaiming it “could not have been clearer” that Bellotti’s\r\nholding forbade distinctions between corporate and indi­\r\nvidual expenditures like the one at issue here, ante, at 30.\r\nThe Court’s reliance is odd. The only thing about Bellotti\r\nthat could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the\r\nmajority’s position. Bellotti ruled, in an explicit limitation\r\non the scope of its holding, that “our consideration of a\r\ncorporation’s right to speak on issues of general public\r\ninterest implies no comparable right in the quite different\r\ncontext of participation in a political campaign for election\r\nto public office.” 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26; see also id., at\r\n787–788 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving\r\npublic confidence in Government and protecting dissenting\r\nshareholders may be “weighty . . . in the context of parti­\r\nsan candidate elections”). Bellotti, in other words, did not\r\ntouch the question presented in Austin and McConnell,\r\nand the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for\r\nwhich the majority cites it.\r\n  The majority attempts to explain away the distinction\r\nBellotti drew—between general corporate speech and\r\ncampaign speech intended to promote or prevent the\r\nelection of specific candidates for office—as inconsistent\r\nwith the rest of the opinion and with Buckley. Ante, at 31,\r\n42–44. Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coher­\r\nent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            53\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nof corporate participation in candidate elections, the “im­\r\nportance” of which “has never been doubted,” 435 U. S., at\r\n788, n. 26, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate\r\nparticipation in referenda. A referendum cannot owe a\r\npolitical debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a\r\ncorporation, or fear the corporation’s retaliation. Cf. Aus\r\ntin, 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J., concurring); Citizens\r\nAgainst Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berke\r\nley, 454 U. S. 290, 299 (1981). The majority likewise\r\noverlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases\r\nhave repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinc­\r\ntion. See, e.g., Austin, 494 U. S., at 659; NCPAC, 470\r\nU. S., at 495–496; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,\r\n468 U. S. 364, 371, n. 9 (1984); NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210,\r\nn. 7. The Court’s critique of Bellotti’s footnote 26 puts it in\r\nthe strange position of trying to elevate Bellotti to canoni­\r\ncal status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical\r\npiece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable\r\nwith Buckley. Bellotti, apparently, is both the font of all\r\nwisdom and internally incoherent.\r\n    The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different\r\nfactual situation from the one that confronts us in this\r\ncase: a state statute that barred business corporations’\r\nexpenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifi­\r\ncally, the statute barred a business corporation “from\r\nmaking contributions or expenditures ‘for the purpose of\r\n. . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question sub­\r\nmitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting\r\nany of the property, business or assets of the corporation,’ ”\r\n435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55,\r\n§8 (West Supp. 1977); alteration in original), and it went\r\nso far as to provide that referenda related to income taxa­\r\ntion would not “ ‘be deemed materially to affect the prop­\r\nerty, business or assets of the corporation,’ ” 435 U. S., at\r\n768. As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this\r\nstatute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed\r\n54    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nstate constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated\r\nincome tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to\r\nprevent corporations from spending money to defeat this\r\namendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators\r\nbut had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. See id., at\r\n769–770, and n. 3. We said that “where, as here, the\r\nlegislature’s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to\r\ngive one side of a debatable public question an advantage\r\nin expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment\r\nis plainly offended.” Id., at 785–786 (footnote omitted).\r\n   Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint-discriminatory stat­\r\nute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even\r\nJustice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that “a\r\nvery persuasive argument could be made that the [Massa­\r\nchusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal in­\r\ncome tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the\r\ncombination of the Commonwealth’s referendum provision\r\nand corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax,\r\nsimply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue\r\nso that it could succeed in its desire.” Id., at 827, n. 6. To\r\nmake matters worse, the law at issue did not make any\r\nallowance for corporations to spend money through PACs.\r\nId., at 768, n. 2 (opinion of the Court). This really was a\r\ncomplete ban on a specific, preidentified subject. See\r\nMCFL, 479 U. S., at 259, n. 12 (stating that 2 U. S. C.\r\n§441b’s expenditure restriction “is of course distinguish\r\nable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for\r\npolitical speech that we invalidated in the state referen­\r\ndum context in . . . Bellotti” (emphasis added)).\r\n   The majority grasps a quotational straw from Bellotti,\r\nthat speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of\r\nthe First Amendment merely because it comes from a\r\ncorporation. Ante, at 30–31. Of course not, but no one\r\nsuggests the contrary and neither Austin nor McConnell\r\nheld otherwise. They held that even though the expendi­\r\ntures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny,\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at\r\n205; Austin, 494 U. S., at 658, 660. We acknowledged in\r\nBellotti that numerous “interests of the highest impor­\r\ntance” can justify campaign finance regulation. 435 U. S.,\r\nat 788–789. But we found no evidence that these interests\r\nwere served by the Massachusetts law. Id., at 789. We\r\nleft open the possibility that our decision might have been\r\ndifferent if there had been “record or legislative findings\r\nthat corporate advocacy threatened imminently to under­\r\nmine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather\r\nthan serving First Amendment interests.” Ibid.\r\n   Austin and McConnell, then, sit perfectly well with\r\nBellotti. Indeed, all six Members of the Austin majority\r\nhad been on the Court at the time of Bellotti, and none so\r\nmuch as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension be­\r\ntween the decisions. The difference between the cases is\r\nnot that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment\r\nprotection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it.\r\nThe difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti\r\nsmacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of\r\ncorporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State\r\nhas a greater interest in regulating independent corporate\r\nexpenditures on candidate elections than on referenda,\r\nbecause in a functioning democracy the public must have\r\nfaith that its representatives owe their positions to the\r\npeople, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.\r\n                           *     *    *\r\n   In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has\r\ndemonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate\r\nparticipation in candidate elections to “ ‘[p]reserv[e] the\r\nintegrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . .\r\nsustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual\r\ncitizen,’ ” protect the expressive interests of shareholders,\r\nand “ ‘[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen’s confidence in\r\n56    CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 788–789; first alteration in\r\noriginal). These understandings provided the combined\r\nimpetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 570–575, the Taft-Hartley Act in\r\n1947, see WRTL, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting),\r\nFECA in 1971, see NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209–210, and\r\nBCRA in 2002, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 126–132.\r\nContinuously for over 100 years, this line of “[c]ampaign\r\nfinance reform has been a series of reactions to docu­\r\nmented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter,\r\nposed by large sums of money from corporate or union\r\ntreasuries.” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissent­\r\ning). Time and again, we have recognized these realities\r\nin approving measures that Congress and the States have\r\ntaken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the con­\r\ntrary. The only thing new about Austin was the dissent,\r\nwith its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of\r\ninterests recognized in the name of democratic integrity\r\nsince the days of the Progressives.\r\n                              IV\r\n   Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in\r\nwhich to revisit Austin and McConnell and why these\r\ndecisions sit perfectly well with “First Amendment princi­\r\nples,” ante, at 1, 48, I come at last to the interests that are\r\nat stake.     The majority recognizes that Austin and\r\nMcConnell may be defended on anticorruption, antidistor­\r\ntion, and shareholder protection rationales. Ante, at 32–\r\n46. It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these\r\nrationales, which overlap and complement each other, and\r\nin applying them to the case at hand.\r\nThe Anticorruption Interest\r\n  Undergirding the majority’s approach to the merits is\r\nthe claim that the only “sufficiently important governmen­\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

This is the same “crabbed view of\r\ncorruption” that was espoused by JUSTICE KENNEDY in\r\nMcConnell and squarely rejected by the Court in that case.\r\n540 U. S., at 152. While it is true that we have not always\r\nspoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the\r\napproach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my\r\njudgment. It disregards our constitutional history and the\r\nfundamental demands of a democratic society.\r\n   On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress’\r\nlegitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent\r\non elections from exerting an “ ‘undue influence on an\r\nofficeholder’s judgment’ ” and from creating “ ‘the appear­\r\nance of such influence,’ ” beyond the sphere of quid pro quo\r\nrelationships. Id., at 150; see also, e.g., id., at 143–144,\r\n152–154; Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441; Shrink Missouri,\r\n528 U. S., at 389. Corruption can take many forms. Brib­\r\nery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between\r\nselling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not\r\nkind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from\r\ngiving special preference to those who spent money on\r\none’s behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and\r\nthe majority’s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrange­\r\nments can be neatly demarcated from other improper\r\ninfluences does not accord with the theory or reality of\r\npolitics. It certainly does not accord with the record Con­\r\ngress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as\r\na remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with\r\nwhich corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may\r\ngo about scratching each other’s backs—and which amply\r\nsupported Congress’ determination to target a limited set\r\nof especially destructive practices.\r\n   The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge\r\nto BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis,\r\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the\r\n58    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ncorrupting consequences of corporate and union independ­\r\nent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA’s passage.\r\nSee McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 555–560, 622–625; see\r\nalso id., at 804–805, 813, n. 143 (Leon, J.) (indicating\r\nagreement). As summarized in her own words:\r\n        “The factual findings of the Court illustrate that\r\n     corporations and labor unions routinely notify Mem­\r\n     bers of Congress as soon as they air electioneering\r\n     communications relevant to the Members’ elections.\r\n     The record also indicates that Members express ap­\r\n     preciation to organizations for the airing of these elec­\r\n     tion-related advertisements.       Indeed, Members of\r\n     Congress are particularly grateful when negative is­\r\n     sue advertisements are run by these organizations,\r\n     leaving the candidates free to run positive advertise­\r\n     ments and be seen as ‘above the fray.’ Political con­\r\n     sultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of\r\n     who is running advertisements on the candidate’s be­\r\n     half, when they are being run, and where they are be­\r\n     ing run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that\r\n     these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to\r\n     influence various Members of Congress.\r\n        “The Findings also demonstrate that Members of\r\n     Congress seek to have corporations and unions run\r\n     these advertisements on their behalf. The Findings\r\n     show that Members suggest that corporations or indi­\r\n     viduals make donations to interest groups with the\r\n     understanding that the money contributed to these\r\n     groups will assist the Member in a campaign. After\r\n     the election, these organizations often seek credit for\r\n     their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Ameri­\r\n     cans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other\r\n     organizations that engage in electioneering communi­\r\n     cations, which benefit specific elected officials, receive\r\n     special consideration from those officials when matters\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Her analysis\r\nshows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of\r\nthe quid pro quo category, as well as the adverse conse­\r\nquences that all such arrangements may have. There are\r\nthreats of corruption that are far more destructive to a\r\ndemocratic society than the odd bribe. Yet the majority’s\r\nunderstanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impo­\r\ntent to address all but the most discrete abuses.\r\n   Our “undue influence” cases have allowed the American\r\npeople to cast a wider net through legislative experiments\r\ndesigned to ensure, to some minimal extent, “that office­\r\nholders will decide issues . . . on the merits or the desires\r\nof their constituencies,” and not “according to the wishes of\r\nthose who have made large financial contributions”—or\r\nexpenditures—“valued by the officeholder.” McConnell,\r\n540 U. S., at 153.63 When private interests are seen to\r\nexert outsized control over officeholders solely on account\r\nof the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns,\r\nthe result can depart so thoroughly “from what is pure or\r\n——————\r\n  63 Cf.Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 389\r\n(2000) (recognizing “the broader threat from politicians too compliant\r\nwith the wishes of large contributors”). Though discrete in scope, these\r\nexperiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a\r\nchance at functioning effectively and preserving the public’s trust.\r\n“Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influ­\r\nence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such\r\ncorruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.”\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 153. There should be nothing controversial\r\nabout the proposition that the influence being targeted is “undue.” In a\r\ndemocracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim\r\nof placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the bene­\r\nfactor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its argu­\r\nments are seen as especially persuasive.\r\n60     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ncorrect” in the conduct of Government, Webster’s Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 512 (1966) (defining “cor­\r\nruption”), that it amounts to a “subversion . . . of the elec­\r\ntoral process,” Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 575. At\r\nstake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is\r\ntherefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Govern­\r\nment but also the public’s faith therein, not only “the\r\ncapacity of this democracy to represent its constituents\r\n[but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to\r\ngovern themselves,” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 507 (Souter, J.,\r\ndissenting). “Take away Congress’ authority to regulate\r\nthe appearance of undue influence and ‘the cynical as­\r\nsumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize\r\nthe willingness of voters to take part in democratic gov­\r\nernance.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting Shrink\r\nMissouri, 528 U. S., at 390).64\r\n  The cluster of interrelated interests threatened by such\r\nundue influence and its appearance has been well cap­\r\ntured under the rubric of “democratic integrity.” WRTL,\r\n551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissenting). This value has\r\nunderlined a century of state and federal efforts to regu­\r\nlate the role of corporations in the electoral process.65\r\n——————\r\n   64 The majority declares by fiat that the appearance of undue influ­\r\n\r\nence by high-spending corporations “will not cause the electorate to lose\r\nfaith in our democracy.” Ante, at 44. The electorate itself has consis­\r\ntently indicated otherwise, both in opinion polls, see McConnell v. FEC,\r\n251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 557–558, 623–624 (DC 2003) (opinion of Kollar-\r\nKotelly, J.), and in the laws its representatives have passed, and our\r\ncolleagues have no basis for elevating their own optimism into a tenet\r\nof constitutional law.\r\n   65 Quite distinct from the interest in preventing improper influences\r\n\r\non the electoral process, I have long believed that “a number of [other]\r\npurposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of\r\nreasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course\r\nof any single campaign.” Davis v. FEC, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip\r\nop., at 3) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). In my\r\njudgment, such limitations may be justified to the extent they are\r\ntailored to “improving the quality of the exposition of ideas” that voters\r\n                      Cite as: 558 U.

Ill. L. Rev.\r\n599, 601. Long before Buckley, we appreciated that “[t]o\r\nsay that Congress is without power to pass appropriate\r\nlegislation to safeguard . . . an election from the improper\r\nuse of money to influence the result is to deny to the na­\r\ntion in a vital particular the power of self protection.”\r\nBurroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 545 (1934).\r\nAnd whereas we have no evidence to support the notion\r\nthat the Framers would have wanted corporations to have\r\nthe same rights as natural persons in the electoral con­\r\ntext, we have ample evidence to suggest that they would\r\nhave been appalled by the evidence of corruption that\r\nCongress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the\r\nCourt today discounts to irrelevance. It is fair to say that\r\n“[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,” Teachout\r\n348, which they understood to encompass the dependency\r\nof public officeholders on private interests, see id., at 373–\r\n374; see also Randall, 548 U. S., at 280 (STEVENS, J.,\r\ndissenting). They discussed corruption “more often in the\r\nConstitutional Convention than factions, violence, or\r\ninstability.” Teachout 352. When they brought our consti­\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nreceive, ibid., “free[ing] candidates and their staffs from the intermina­\r\n\r\nble burden of fundraising,” ibid.

S. 230, 278 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (internal quotation\r\n\r\nmarks omitted). I continue to adhere to these beliefs, but they have not\r\n\r\nbeen briefed by the parties or amici in this case, and their soundness is\r\n\r\nimmaterial to its proper disposition. \r\n\r\n62    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ntutional order into being, the Framers had their minds\r\ntrained on a threat to republican self-government that this\r\nCourt has lost sight of.\r\nQuid Pro Quo Corruption\r\n   There is no need to take my side in the debate over the\r\nscope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court’s\r\nmerits holding is wrong. Even under the majority’s\r\n“crabbed view of corruption,” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 152,\r\nthe Government should not lose this case.\r\n   “The importance of the governmental interest in pre­\r\nventing [corruption through the creation of political debts]\r\nhas never been doubted.” Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.\r\nEven in the cases that have construed the anticorruption\r\ninterest most narrowly, we have never suggested that\r\nsuch quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright\r\nvote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct\r\ncrimes. Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which\r\noutside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a\r\nlegislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of,\r\nsome outlay of money the parties have made or will make\r\non behalf of the officeholder. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at\r\n143 (“We have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to\r\nthe elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In Buckley,\r\nwe expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws\r\nprovided a less restrictive alternative to FECA’s contribu­\r\ntion limits, noting that such laws ‘deal[t] with only the\r\nmost blatant and specific attempts of those with money to\r\ninfluence governmental action’ ” (quoting 424 U. S., at 28;\r\nalteration in original)). It has likewise never been doubted\r\nthat “[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual\r\nquid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appear­\r\nance of corruption.” Id., at 27. Congress may “legiti­\r\nmately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of\r\nimproper influence is also critical . . . if confidence in the\r\nsystem of representative Government is not to be eroded\r\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

A democracy cannot func­\r\ntion effectively when its constituent members believe laws\r\nare being bought and sold.\r\n   In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied\r\nto BCRA §203, however, they conclude “[t]he anticorrup­\r\ntion interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in\r\nquestion.” Ante, at 41.\r\n   Although the Court suggests that Buckley compels its\r\nconclusion, ante, at 40–44, Buckley cannot sustain this\r\nreading. It is true that, in evaluating FECA’s ceiling on\r\nindependent expenditures by all persons, the Buckley\r\nCourt found the governmental interest in preventing\r\ncorruption “inadequate.” 424 U. S., at 45. But Buckley did\r\nnot evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it\r\nrule out the possibility that a future Court might find\r\notherwise. The opinion reasoned that an expenditure\r\nlimitation covering only express advocacy (i.e., magic\r\nwords) would likely be ineffectual, ibid., a problem that\r\nCongress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that “the\r\nindependent advocacy restricted by [FECA §608(e)(1)] does\r\nnot presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent\r\ncorruption comparable to those identified with large cam­\r\npaign contributions,” id., at 46 (emphasis added). Buckley\r\nexpressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale\r\nmight justify restrictions on independent expenditures at\r\na later date, “because it may be that, in some circum­\r\nstances, ‘large independent expenditures pose the same\r\ndangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements\r\nas do large contributions.’ ” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 478\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at\r\n45). Certainly Buckley did not foreclose this possibility\r\nwith respect to electioneering communications made with\r\ncorporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had\r\nno occasion to consider.\r\n   The Austin Court did not rest its holding on quid pro\r\n64    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nquo corruption, as it found the broader corruption impli­\r\ncated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection\r\nrationales a sufficient basis for Michigan’s restriction on\r\ncorporate electioneering. 494 U. S., at 658–660. Concur­\r\nring in that opinion, I took the position that “the danger of\r\neither the fact, or the appearance, of quid pro quo rela­\r\ntionships [also] provides an adequate justification for state\r\nregulation” of these independent expenditures. Id., at 678.\r\nI did not see this position as inconsistent with Buckley’s\r\nanalysis of individual expenditures. Corporations, as a\r\nclass, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the\r\nlegislative process and more directly affected by tax and\r\nappropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny;\r\nthey also have vastly more money with which to try to buy\r\naccess and votes. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating\r\nthat the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1\r\ntrillion during the last election cycle). Business corpora­\r\ntions must engage the political process in instrumental\r\nterms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The\r\nunparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single­\r\nminded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make\r\nquid pro quo corruption and its appearance inherently\r\nmore likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups)\r\nspend unrestricted sums on elections.\r\n   It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now\r\nsay that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative\r\nand judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a\r\nsubstantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corpora­\r\ntions grew more and more adept at crafting “issue ads” to\r\nhelp or harm a particular candidate, these nominally\r\nindependent expenditures began to corrupt the political\r\nprocess in a very direct sense. The sponsors of these ads\r\nwere routinely granted special access after the campaign\r\nwas over; “candidates and officials knew who their friends\r\nwere,” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 129. Many corporate\r\nindependent expenditures, it seemed, had become essen­\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

In an\r\nage in which money and television ads are the coin of the\r\ncampaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations\r\ndeployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influ­\r\nence over, public officials.\r\n    The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA\r\nrecord does not contain “direct examples of votes being\r\nexchanged for . . . expenditures.” Ante, at 45 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). It would have been quite re­\r\nmarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such\r\nbehavior by its own Members. Proving that a specific vote\r\nwas exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been\r\nnext to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motiva­\r\ntions, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote.\r\nYet, even if “[i]ngratiation and access . . . are not corrup­\r\ntion” themselves, ibid., they are necessary prerequisites to\r\nit; they can create both the opportunity for, and the ap­\r\npearance of, quid pro quo arrangements. The influx of\r\nunlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also\r\ncreates new opportunities for the mirror image of quid pro\r\nquo deals: threats, both explicit and implicit. Starting\r\ntoday, corporations with large war chests to deploy on\r\nelectioneering may find democratically elected bodies\r\nbecoming much more attuned to their interests. The\r\nmajority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong\r\nconclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record pro­\r\nvides “only scant evidence that independent expenditures\r\n. . . ingratiate,” and that, “in any event,” none of it mat­\r\nters. Ibid.\r\n    In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly\r\ndocumented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and\r\nexplained its significance under the majority’s own touch­\r\nstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption ration­\r\nale, Buckley.

One former Senator candidly admitted to\r\nthe District Court that “ ‘[c]andidates whose campaigns\r\nbenefit from [phony “issue ads”] greatly appreciate the\r\nhelp of these groups. In fact, Members will also be favora­\r\nbly disposed to those who finance these groups when they\r\nlater seek access to discuss pending legislation.’ ” Id., at\r\n556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers). One\r\nprominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontro­\r\nverted testimony, that “ ‘unregulated expenditures—\r\nwhether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad\r\ncampaigns—can sometimes generate far more influence\r\nthan direct campaign contributions.’ ” Ibid. (quoting decla­\r\nration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum,\r\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly found, “[t]he record powerfully dem­\r\nonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with\r\nthe general treasury funds of labor unions and corpora­\r\ntions endears those entities to elected officials in a way\r\nthat could be perceived by the public as corrupting.” Id., at\r\n622–623. She concluded that the Government’s interest in\r\npreventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept\r\nwas defined in Buckley, was itself sufficient to uphold\r\nBCRA §203. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 622–625. Judge Leon\r\nagreed. See id., at 804–805 (dissenting only with re-\r\nspect to the Wellstone Amendment’s coverage of MCFL\r\ncorporations).\r\n   When the McConnell Court affirmed the judgment of the\r\nDistrict Court regarding §203, we did not rest our holding\r\non a narrow notion of quid pro quo corruption. Instead we\r\nrelied on the governmental interest in combating the\r\nunique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as\r\nrecognized in Austin’s antidistortion and shareholder\r\nprotection rationales, 540 U. S., at 205 (citing Austin, 494\r\nU. S., at 660), as well as the interest in preventing cir­\r\ncumvention of contribution limits, 540 U. S., at 128–129,\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Had we felt constrained by the view of\r\ntoday’s Court that quid pro quo corruption and its appear­\r\nance are the only interests that count in this field, ante, at\r\n32–46, we of course would have looked closely at that\r\nissue. And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly re­\r\nflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found\r\none or both of those interests satisfied and §203 appropri­\r\nately tailored to them.\r\n   The majority’s rejection of the Buckley anticorruption\r\nrationale on the ground that independent corporate ex­\r\npenditures “do not give rise to [quid pro quo] corruption or\r\nthe appearance of corruption,” ante, at 42, is thus unfair\r\nas well as unreasonable. Congress and outside experts\r\nhave generated significant evidence corroborating this\r\nrationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the\r\nrelevant materials before us is that the Government had\r\nno reason to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge\r\nthe plaintiff had abandoned. The Court cannot both\r\nsua sponte choose to relitigate McConnell on appeal and\r\nthen complain that the Government has failed to substan­\r\ntiate its case. If our colleagues were really serious about\r\nthe interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, they\r\nwould remand to the District Court with instructions to\r\ncommence evidentiary proceedings.66\r\n   The insight that even technically independent expendi­\r\n——————\r\n   66 In fact, the notion that the “electioneering communications” covered\r\n\r\nby §203 can breed quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of such\r\ncorruption has only become more plausible since we decided McConnell.\r\nRecall that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s controlling opinion in WRTL subse­\r\nquently limited BCRA’s definition of “electioneering communications”\r\nto those that are “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than\r\nas an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.” 551 U. S., at\r\n470. The upshot was that after WRTL, a corporate or union expendi­\r\nture could be regulated under §203 only if everyone would understand\r\nit as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office. It\r\ndoes not take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy\r\nmight be especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.\r\n68    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ntures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct\r\ncontributions is bolstered by our decision last year in\r\nCaperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___ (2009). In\r\nthat case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a\r\ncorporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Vir­\r\nginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular\r\ncandidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that\r\ncourt. “In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory\r\nmaximum        to    Benjamin’s      campaign      committee,\r\nBlankenship donated almost $2.5 million to ‘And For The\r\nSake Of The Kids,’ ” a §527 corporation that ran ads tar­\r\ngeting Benjamin’s opponent. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\r\n“This was not all. Blankenship spent, in addition, just\r\nover $500,000 on independent expenditures . . . ‘ “to sup­\r\nport . . . Brent Benjamin.” ’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2–3)\r\n(second alteration in original). Applying its common\r\nsense, this Court accepted petitioners’ argument that\r\nBlankenship’s “pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin\r\nelected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of\r\nactual bias” when Benjamin later declined to recuse him­\r\nself from the appeal by Blankenship’s corporation. Id., at\r\n___ (slip op., at 11). “Though n[o] . . . bribe or criminal\r\ninfluence” was involved, we recognized that “Justice Ben­\r\njamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to\r\nBlankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him\r\nelected.” Ibid. “The difficulties of inquiring into actual\r\nbias,” we further noted, “simply underscore the need for\r\nobjective rules,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 13)—rules which\r\nwill perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its\r\nactual existence.\r\n  In Caperton, then, we accepted the premise that, at\r\nleast in some circumstances, independent expenditures on\r\ncandidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of quid\r\npro quo corruption. Indeed, this premise struck the Court\r\nas so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship’s\r\nspending on behalf of Benjamin—spending that consisted\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

The reason the Court\r\nso thoroughly conflated expenditures and contributions,\r\none assumes, is that it realized that some expenditures\r\nmay be functionally equivalent to contributions in the way\r\nthey influence the outcome of a race, the way they are\r\ninterpreted by the candidates and the public, and the way\r\nthey taint the decisions that the officeholder thereafter\r\ntakes.\r\n   Caperton is illuminating in several additional respects.\r\nIt underscores the old insight that, on account of the ex­\r\ntreme difficulty of proving corruption, “prophylactic meas­\r\nures, reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in\r\npurpose or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard\r\nagainst corruption.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 30; see also\r\nShrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 392, n. 5. It underscores\r\nthat “certain restrictions on corporate electoral involve­\r\nment” may likewise be needed to “hedge against circum­\r\nvention of valid contribution limits.” McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks and brackets\r\nomitted); see also Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 456 (“[A]ll\r\nMembers of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid\r\ntheory of corruption”). It underscores that for-profit cor­\r\nporations associated with electioneering communications\r\nwill often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with “mislead­\r\ning names,” such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, “to\r\n70     CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 128; see also id., at 196–197.\r\n   And it underscores that the consequences of today’s\r\nholding will not be limited to the legislative or executive\r\ncontext. The majority of the States select their judges\r\nthrough popular elections. At a time when concerns about\r\nthe conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch,\r\nsee, e.g., O’Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov.\r\n15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et al. as Amici\r\nCuriae 2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of\r\ncorporate and union general treasury spending in these\r\nraces. Perhaps “Caperton motions” will catch some of the\r\nworst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States\r\nthat, after today, may no longer have the ability to place\r\nmodest limits on corporate electioneering even if they\r\nbelieve such limits to be critical to maintaining the integ­\r\nrity of their judicial systems.\r\nDeference and Incumbent Self-Protection\r\n   Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch\r\nof Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorrup­\r\ntion rationale without serious analysis.67 Today’s opinion\r\nprovides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Con­\r\ngress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies\r\nhave offered one: the incentives of the legislators who\r\npassed BCRA. Section 203, our colleagues have suggested,\r\nmay be little more than “an incumbency protection plan,”\r\nMcConnell, 540 U.

It is\r\nunclear to me what these maxims mean, but as applied by the Court\r\nthey clearly do not entail “deference” in any normal sense of that term.\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

This\r\npossibility, the Court apparently believes, licenses it to\r\nrun roughshod over Congress’ handiwork.\r\n   In my view, we should instead start by acknowledging\r\nthat “Congress surely has both wisdom and experience in\r\nthese matters that is far superior to ours.” Colorado\r\nRepublican Federal Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U. S.\r\n604, 650 (1996) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Many of our\r\ncampaign finance precedents explicitly and forcefully\r\naffirm the propriety of such presumptive deference. See,\r\ne.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 158; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at\r\n155–156; NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209–210.               Moreover,\r\n“[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as\r\nhere, we deal with a congressional judgment that has\r\nremained essentially unchanged throughout a century of\r\ncareful legislative adjustment.” Beaumont, 539 U. S., at\r\n162, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Shrink\r\nMissouri, 528 U. S., at 391 (“The quantum of empirical\r\nevidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of\r\nlegislative judgments will vary up or down with the nov­\r\nelty and plausibility of the justification raised”). In Amer­\r\nica, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern cam­\r\npaign finance, just like all other laws. To apply a level of\r\nscrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating elec­\r\ntioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self­\r\ninterest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate\r\nelectioneering.\r\n   This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if\r\nthere were a solid basis for believing that a legislative\r\naction was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents\r\nor that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral\r\nprocess.68 See League of United Latin American Citizens\r\n——————\r\n 68 JUSTICE   BREYER has suggested that we strike the balance as fol­\r\n72     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nv. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 447 (2006) (STEVENS, J., concur­\r\nring in part and dissenting in part); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541\r\nU. S. 267, 317 (2004) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Along\r\nwith our duty to balance competing constitutional con­\r\ncerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elec­\r\ntions remain at least minimally open, fair, and competi­\r\ntive. But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss\r\nCongress’ years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned\r\njudgment on this basis, without first confirming that the\r\nstatute in question was intended to be, or will function as,\r\na restraint on electoral competition. “Absent record evi­\r\ndence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a\r\nclass, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate\r\nlegislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restric­\r\ntions.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 31.\r\n   We have no record evidence from which to conclude that\r\nBCRA §203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the\r\nCourt today calls into question, reflects or fosters such\r\ninvidious discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that\r\n“ ‘any restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is\r\nequally available to challengers and incumbents tends to\r\nfavor incumbents.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 249 (opinion\r\nof SCALIA, J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be\r\nturned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by §203\r\nmight well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents\r\nhave pre-existing relationships with corporations and\r\nunions, and groups that wish to procure legislative bene­\r\nfits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting\r\nofficeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits\r\nand is statistically likely to retain office. If a corporation’s\r\ngoal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corpo­\r\n——————\r\nlows: “We should defer to [the legislature’s] political judgment that\r\nunlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process. But\r\nwe should not defer in respect to whether its solution . . . insulates\r\nlegislators from effective electoral challenge.” Shrink Missouri, 528\r\nU.

Nor do we\r\nhave a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court’s\r\nfailure to cite any empirical research attests. Nor does the\r\nlegislative history give reason for concern. Congress\r\ndevoted years of careful study to the issues underlying\r\nBCRA; “[f]ew legislative proposals in recent years have\r\nreceived as much sustained public commentary or news\r\ncoverage”; “[p]olitical scientists and academic experts . . .\r\nwith no self-interest in incumbent protectio[n] were cen­\r\ntral figures in pressing the case for BCRA”; and the legis­\r\nlation commanded bipartisan support from the outset.\r\nPildes, The Supreme Court 2003 Term Foreword: The\r\nConstitutionalization of Democratic Politics, 118 Harv.\r\nL. Rev. 28, 137 (2004). Finally, it is important to remem­\r\nber just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were\r\nprior to BCRA’s passage. As the Solicitor General aptly\r\nremarked at the time, “the evidence supports overwhelm­\r\ningly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under\r\nthe old system just fine.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in McConnell v.\r\nFEC, O. T. 2003, No. 02–1674, p. 61. “It would be hard to\r\ndevelop a scheme that could be better for incumbents.”\r\nId., at 63.\r\n   In this case, then, “there is no convincing evidence that\r\nth[e] important interests favoring expenditure limits are\r\nfronts for incumbency protection.” Randall, 548 U. S., at\r\n279 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). “In the meantime, a legisla­\r\ntive judgment that ‘enough is enough’ should command\r\nthe greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a\r\nconstitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect\r\nrelationship to activity that affects the quantity . . . of\r\nrepetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.” Id., at 279–\r\n74     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n280. The majority cavalierly ignores Congress’ factual\r\nfindings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges\r\nthe validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it\r\neffectively discounts the value of that interest to zero.\r\nThis is quite different from conscientious policing for\r\nimpermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensi­\r\ntive First Amendment context. It is the denial of Con­\r\ngress’ authority to regulate corporate spending on\r\nelections.\r\nAustin and Corporate Expenditures\r\n   Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general\r\nsocietal interests at stake in campaign finance regulation,\r\nit also overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by\r\nthe regulation of corporate expenditures. The majority\r\nfails to appreciate that Austin’s antidistortion rationale is\r\nitself an anticorruption rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660\r\n(describing “a different type of corruption”), tied to the\r\nspecial concerns raised by corporations. Understood prop­\r\nerly, “antidistortion” is simply a variant on the classic\r\ngovernmental interest in protecting against improper\r\ninfluences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic\r\nprocess. It is manifestly not just an “ ‘equalizing’ ” ideal in\r\ndisguise. Ante, at 34 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48).69\r\n——————\r\n  69 THE  CHIEF JUSTICE denies this, ante, at 9–10, citing scholarship\r\nthat has interpreted Austin to endorse an equality rationale, along with\r\nan article by Justice Thurgood Marshall’s former law clerk that states\r\nthat Marshall, the author of Austin, accepted “equality of opportunity”\r\nand “equalizing access to the political process” as bases for campaign\r\nfinance regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall’s\r\nJurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 667–668\r\n(2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is fair to say that Austin\r\ncan bear an egalitarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this\r\ncharacterization of Justice Marshall’s beliefs. But the fact that Austin\r\ncan be read a certain way hardly proves THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s charge\r\nthat there is nothing more to it. Many of our precedents can bear\r\nmultiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some “equalizing”\r\nimplications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our\r\n                    Cite as: 558 U.

Antidistortion\r\n   The fact that corporations are different from human\r\nbeings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the\r\nmajority opinion almost completely elides it. Austin set\r\nforth some of the basic differences. Unlike natural per­\r\nsons, corporations have “limited liability” for their owners\r\nand managers, “perpetual life,” separation of ownership\r\nand control, “and favorable treatment of the accumulation\r\nand distribution of assets . . . that enhance their ability to\r\nattract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that\r\nmaximize the return on their shareholders’ investments.”\r\n494 U. S., at 658–659. Unlike voters in U. S. elections,\r\ncorporations may be foreign controlled.70 Unlike other\r\ninterest groups, business corporations have been “effec­\r\ntively delegated responsibility for ensuring society’s eco­\r\nnomic welfare”;71 they inescapably structure the life of\r\nevery citizen. “ ‘[T]he resources in the treasury of a busi­\r\nness corporation,’ ” furthermore, “ ‘are not an indication of\r\npopular support for the corporation’s political ideas.’ ” Id.,\r\nat 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 258). “ ‘They reflect\r\ninstead the economically motivated decisions of investors\r\nand customers. The availability of these resources may\r\n——————\r\ntakings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure. More\r\nimportant, the Austin Court expressly declined to rely on a speech­\r\nequalization rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660, and we have never under­\r\nstood Austin to stand for such a rationale. Whatever his personal\r\nviews, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that THE\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE suggests he did; indeed, he “would have viewed it as\r\nirresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale\r\nbased on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would\r\nhave even considered joining,” Garrett, 52 Howard L. J., at 674.\r\n   70 In state elections, even domestic corporations may be “foreign”­\r\n\r\ncontrolled in the sense that they are incorporated in another jurisdic­\r\ntion and primarily owned and operated by out-of-state residents.\r\n   71 Regan, Corporate Speech and Civic Virtue, in Debating Democ­\r\n\r\nracy’s Discontent 289, 302 (A.

S., at 659 (quoting\r\nMCFL, 479 U. S., at 258).72\r\n   It might also be added that corporations have no con­\r\nsciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires.\r\nCorporations help structure and facilitate the activities of\r\nhuman beings, to be sure, and their “personhood” often\r\nserves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not them­\r\nselves members of “We the People” by whom and for whom\r\nour Constitution was established.\r\n   These basic points help explain why corporate election­\r\neering is not only more likely to impair compelling gov­\r\nernmental interests, but also why restrictions on that\r\nelectioneering are less likely to encroach upon First\r\nAmendment freedoms. One fundamental concern of the\r\nFirst Amendment is to “protec[t] the individual’s interest\r\nin self-expression.” Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v.\r\nPublic Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U.

S., at 660, 665, 667, but its antidistortion argu­\r\nment relied only on the basic descriptive features of corporations, as\r\nsketched above. It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the\r\ncorporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in\r\nfundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to\r\nregulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its\r\nconcern.

S. 15, 24 (1971), and it facili­\r\ntates the value of “individual self-realization,” Redish, The\r\nValue of Free Speech, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 591, 594 (1982).\r\nCorporate speech, however, is derivative speech, speech by\r\nproxy. A regulation such as BCRA §203 may affect the\r\nway in which individuals disseminate certain messages\r\nthrough the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone\r\nfrom speaking in his or her own voice. “Within the realm\r\nof [campaign spending] generally,” corporate spending is\r\n“furthest from the core of political expression.” Beaumont,\r\n539 U. S., at 161, n. 8.\r\n   It is an interesting question “who” is even speaking\r\nwhen a business corporation places an advertisement that\r\nendorses or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it\r\nis not the customers or employees, who typically have no\r\nsay in such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be\r\nthe shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the\r\nday-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political prefer­\r\nences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers\r\nor directors of the corporation have the best claim to be\r\nthe ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally\r\nprohibit them from using corporate funds for personal\r\nends. Some individuals associated with the corporation\r\nmust make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that\r\nthese individuals are thereby fostering their self­\r\nexpression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful.\r\nIt is entirely possible that the corporation’s electoral mes­\r\nsage will conflict with their personal convictions. Take\r\naway the ability to use general treasury funds for some of\r\nthose ads, and no one’s autonomy, dignity, or political\r\nequality has been impinged upon in the least.\r\n   Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from indi­\r\nvidual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view\r\nthat a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on\r\nindividuals’ electioneering expenditures in the service of\r\n78     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthe governmental interests explained above, and in recog­\r\nnition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct\r\nrestraints on speech but rather on its financing. See, e.g.,\r\nRandall, 548 U. S., at 273 (dissenting opinion). But those\r\nrestrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the\r\nprimary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is\r\ninvolved. Some of those individuals might feel that they\r\nneed to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particu­\r\nlar candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral\r\npreferences. This is obviously not the situation with busi­\r\nness corporations, as their routine practice of giving “sub­\r\nstantial sums to both major national parties” makes pellu­\r\ncidly clear. McConnell, 540 U. S., at 148. “[C]orporate\r\nparticipation” in elections, any business executive will tell\r\nyou, “is more transactional than ideological.” Supp. Brief\r\nfor Committee for Economic Development as Amicus\r\nCuriae 10.\r\n   In this transactional spirit, some corporations have\r\naffirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their elec­\r\ntioneering communications. These corporations fear that\r\nofficeholders will shake them down for supportive ads,\r\nthat they will have to spend increasing sums on elections\r\nin an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors,\r\nand that public trust in business will be eroded. See id.,\r\nat 10–19. A system that effectively forces corporations to\r\nuse their shareholders’ money both to maintain access to,\r\nand to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ulti­\r\nmately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corpo­\r\nrations. It can impose a kind of implicit tax.73\r\n——————\r\n  73 Not all corporations support BCRA §203, of course, and not all cor­\r\n\r\nporations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts.\r\nSome nonprofit corporations are created for an ideological purpose.\r\nSome closely held corporations are strongly identified with a particular\r\nowner or founder. The fact that §203, like the statute at issue in\r\nAustin, regulates some of these corporations’ expenditures does not\r\ndisturb the analysis above. See 494 U. S., at 661–665. Small-business\r\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                 79\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n  In short, regulations such as §203 and the statute up­\r\nheld in Austin impose only a limited burden on First\r\nAmendment freedoms not only because they target a\r\nnarrow subset of expenditures and leave untouched the\r\nbroader “public dialogue,” ante, at 25, but also because\r\nthey leave untouched the speech of natural persons.\r\nRecognizing the weakness of a speaker-based critique of\r\nAustin, the Court places primary emphasis not on the\r\ncorporation’s right to electioneer, but rather on the lis­\r\ntener’s interest in hearing what every possible speaker\r\nmay have to say. The Court’s central argument is that\r\nlaws such as §203 have “ ‘deprived [the electorate] of in­\r\nformation, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,’ ”\r\nante, at 38 (quoting CIO, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J.,\r\nconcurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, “interferes\r\nwith the ‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First\r\nAmendment,” ante, at 38 (quoting New York State Bd. of\r\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008)).\r\n  There are many flaws in this argument. If the overrid­\r\ning concern depends on the interests of the audience,\r\nsurely the public’s perception of the value of corporate\r\nspeech should be given important weight. That perception\r\ntoday is the same as it was a century ago when Theodore\r\nRoosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time,\r\nled to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign ex­\r\npenditures that is overruled today. See WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 509–510 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President\r\n——————\r\nowners may speak in their own names, rather than the business’, if\r\nthey wish to evade §203 altogether. Nonprofit corporations that want\r\nto make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they\r\nrefuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to\r\ndisassociate without economic penalty. See MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, 264\r\n(1986). Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a con­\r\ncern about BCRA’s coverage of nonprofits that have ideological mis­\r\nsions but lack MCFL status, our colleagues refuse to apply the Snowe-\r\nJeffords Amendment or the lower courts’ de minimis exception to\r\nMCFL. See ante, at 10–12.\r\n80    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt’s remarks). The distinctive threat to democratic\r\nintegrity posed by corporate domination of politics was\r\nrecognized at “the inception of the republic” and “has been\r\na persistent theme in American political life” ever since.\r\nRegan 302. It is only certain Members of this Court, not\r\nthe listeners themselves, who have agitated for more cor­\r\nporate electioneering.\r\n   Austin recognized that there are substantial reasons\r\nwhy a legislature might conclude that unregulated general\r\ntreasury expenditures will give corporations “unfai[r]\r\ninfluence” in the electoral process, 494 U. S., at 660, and\r\ndistort public debate in ways that undermine rather than\r\nadvance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of\r\ncorporations allows them to amass and deploy financial\r\nresources on a scale few natural persons can match. The\r\nstructure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a\r\nline between the corporation’s economic interests and the\r\npolitical preferences of the individuals associated with the\r\ncorporation; the corporation must engage the electoral\r\nprocess with the aim “to enhance the profitability of the\r\ncompany, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a\r\nbroader or conflicting set of priorities,” Brief for American\r\nIndependent Business Alliance as Amicus Curiae 11; see\r\nalso ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis\r\nand Recommendations §2.01(a), p. 55 (1992) (“[A] corpora­\r\ntion . . . should have as its objective the conduct of busi­\r\nness activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit\r\nand shareholder gain”). In a state election such as the one\r\nat issue in Austin, the interests of nonresident corpora­\r\ntions may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of\r\nlocal voters. Consequently, when corporations grab up the\r\nprime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can\r\nflood the market with advocacy that bears “little or no\r\ncorrelation” to the ideas of natural persons or to any\r\nbroader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660. The\r\nopinions of real people may be marginalized. “The expen­\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           81\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nditure restrictions of [2 U. S. C.] §441b are thus meant to\r\nensure that competition among actors in the political\r\narena is truly competition among ideas.” MCFL, 479\r\nU. S., at 259.\r\n  In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorpo­\r\nrate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow\r\nsoon thereafter. Corporate “domination” of electioneering,\r\nAustin, 494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that\r\ncorporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn\r\non their televisions and radios before an election and hear\r\nonly corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their\r\ncapacity, as citizens, to influence public policy. A Gov­\r\nernment captured by corporate interests, they may come\r\nto believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor\r\nwilling to give their views a fair hearing. The predictable\r\nresult is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased\r\nperception that large spenders “ ‘call the tune’ ” and a\r\nreduced “ ‘willingness of voters to take part in democratic\r\ngovernance.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting\r\nShrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390). To the extent that\r\ncorporations are allowed to exert undue influence in elec­\r\ntoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those\r\nraces may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a\r\ncertain corporation can make or break their reelection\r\nchances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.\r\nOn a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneer­\r\ning might diminish the ability of citizens to “hold officials\r\naccountable to the people,” ante, at 23, and disserve the\r\ngoal of a public debate that is “uninhibited, robust, and\r\nwide-open,” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.\r\n254, 270 (1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature\r\nis entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored\r\nmeasures in response.\r\n  The majority’s unwillingness to distinguish between\r\ncorporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possi­\r\nbility that corporations’ “war chests” and their special\r\n82    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n“advantages” in the legal realm, Austin, 494 U. S., at 659,\r\nmay translate into special advantages in the market for\r\nlegislation. When large numbers of citizens have a com­\r\nmon stake in a measure that is under consideration, it\r\nmay be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on\r\nbehalf of their position. The corporate form, by contrast,\r\n“provides a simple way to channel rents to only those who\r\nhave paid their dues, as it were. If you do not own stock,\r\nyou do not benefit from the larger dividends or apprecia­\r\ntion in the stock price caused by the passage of private\r\ninterest legislation.” Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech,\r\nPolitical Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate\r\nCharters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corpora­\r\ntions, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that\r\nfavor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of\r\nmoney but because of their legal and organizational struc­\r\nture. Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and\r\nthe door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is\r\n“far more destructive” than what noncorporations are\r\ncapable of. Ibid. It is for reasons such as these that our\r\ncampaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that\r\n“the ‘differing structures and purposes’ of different entities\r\n‘may require different forms of regulation in order to\r\nprotect the integrity of the electoral process.’ ” NRWC, 459\r\nU. S., at 210 (quoting California Medical Assn., 453 U. S.,\r\nat 201).\r\n   The Court’s facile depiction of corporate electioneering\r\nassumes away all of these complexities. Our colleagues\r\nridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on\r\n“nothing more” than a fear that corporations have a spe­\r\ncial “ability to persuade,” ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS,\r\nC. J.), as if corporations were our society’s ablest debaters\r\nand viewpoint-neutral laws such as §203 were created to\r\nsuppress their best arguments. In their haste to knock\r\ndown yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore\r\nthe fundamental concerns of the Austin Court and the\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    83\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nlegislatures that have passed laws like §203: to safeguard\r\nthe integrity, competitiveness, and democratic responsive­\r\nness of the electoral process. All of the majority’s theoreti­\r\ncal arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable\r\nsurface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experi­\r\nence, “that there is no such thing as too much speech,”\r\nAustin, 494 U. S., at 695 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).74 If\r\nindividuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to\r\nand contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by any­\r\none, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no\r\nspecial ability to influence elections apart from the merits\r\nof their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if\r\nlegislators always operated with nothing less than perfect\r\nvirtue; then I suppose the majority’s premise would be\r\nsound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domina­\r\ntion of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the\r\naverage listener’s exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it\r\nmay diminish citizens’ willingness and capacity to partici­\r\npate in the democratic process.\r\n   None of this is to suggest that corporations can or\r\nshould be denied an opportunity to participate in election\r\ncampaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a\r\nwork of art such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be\r\nbanned), or to deny that some corporate speech may con­\r\ntribute significantly to public debate. What it shows,\r\nhowever, is that Austin’s “concern about corporate domi­\r\nnation of the political process,” 494 U. S., at 659, reflects\r\nmore than a concern to protect governmental interests\r\noutside of the First Amendment. It also reflects a concern\r\nto facilitate First Amendment values by preserving some\r\nbreathing room around the electoral “marketplace” of\r\nideas, ante, at 19, 34, 38, 52, 54, the marketplace in which\r\nthe actual people of this Nation determine how they will\r\n——————\r\n  74 Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, class­\r\n\r\nroom, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.\r\n84    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ngovern themselves. The majority seems oblivious to the\r\nsimple truth that laws such as §203 do not merely pit the\r\nanticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but\r\nalso pit competing First Amendment values against each\r\nother. There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any\r\neffort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers\r\nagainst the First Amendment rights of listeners. But\r\nwhen the speakers in question are not real people and\r\nwhen the appeal to “First Amendment principles” depends\r\nalmost entirely on the listeners’ perspective, ante, at 1, 48,\r\nit becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actu­\r\nally be affected.\r\n   In critiquing Austin’s antidistortion rationale and cam­\r\npaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues\r\nplace tremendous weight on the example of media corpora­\r\ntions. See ante, at 35–38, 46; ante, at 1, 11 (opinion of\r\nROBERTS, C. J.); ante, at 6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet it is\r\nnot at all clear that Austin would permit §203 to be ap­\r\nplied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in\r\nthe text, history, and structure of the First Amendment\r\nbut also in facilitating public discourse; as the Austin\r\nCourt explained, “media corporations differ significantly\r\nfrom other corporations in that their resources are devoted\r\nto the collection of information and its dissemination to\r\nthe public,” 494 U. S., at 667. Our colleagues have raised\r\nsome interesting and difficult questions about Congress’\r\nauthority to regulate electioneering by the press, and\r\nabout how to define what constitutes the press. But that\r\nis not the case before us. Section 203 does not apply to\r\nmedia corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is\r\nnot a media corporation. There would be absolutely no\r\nreason to consider the issue of media corporations if the\r\nmajority did not, first, transform Citizens United’s as­\r\napplied challenge into a facial challenge and, second,\r\ninvent the theory that legislatures must eschew all “iden­\r\ntity”-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news\r\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   85\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\noutlet exactly the same as General Motors.75 This calls to\r\nmind George Berkeley’s description of philosophers: “[W]e\r\nhave first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.”\r\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, ¶3\r\n(R. Woolhouse ed. 1988).\r\n   It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues\r\nfeared that a campaign finance regulation such as §203\r\nmay be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore\r\nattended carefully to the choices the Legislature has\r\nmade. But the majority does not bother to consider such\r\npractical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply\r\nstipulates that “enlightened self-government” can arise\r\nonly in the absence of regulation. Ante, at 23. In light of\r\nthe distinctive features of corporations identified in Aus\r\ntin, there is no valid basis for this assumption. The mar­\r\nketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items—or\r\nlaws—are meant to be bought and sold, and when we\r\nmove from the realm of economics to the realm of corpo­\r\nrate electioneering, there may be no “reason to think the\r\nmarket ordering is intrinsically good at all,” Strauss 1386.\r\n   The Court’s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the\r\nFirst Amendment may well promote corporate power at\r\nthe cost of the individual and collective self-expression the\r\nAmendment was meant to serve. It will undoubtedly\r\ncripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the\r\nStates to adopt even limited measures to protect against\r\ncorporate domination of the electoral process. Americans\r\nmay be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced\r\n——————\r\n  75 Under the majority’s view, the legislature is thus damned if it does\r\nand damned if it doesn’t. If the legislature gives media corporations an\r\nexemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corpora­\r\ntions, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against\r\nidentity-based distinctions. If the legislature does not give media\r\ncorporations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of\r\nthe press. The only way out of this invented bind: no regulations\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n86    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthe cause of self-government today.\r\n                   2. Shareholder Protection\r\n    There is yet another way in which laws such as §203 can\r\nserve First Amendment values. Interwoven with Austin’s\r\nconcern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a\r\nconcern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of\r\ncoerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not\r\n“reflec[t] [their] support.” 494 U. S., at 660–661. When\r\ncorporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a\r\nparticular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the\r\nresidual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.\r\nThose shareholders who disagree with the corporation’s\r\nelectoral message may find their financial investments\r\nbeing used to undermine their political convictions.\r\n    The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that\r\nthose who pay for an electioneering communication actu­\r\nally support its content and that managers do not use\r\ngeneral treasuries to advance personal agendas. Ibid. It\r\n“ ‘allows corporate political participation without the temp­\r\ntation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite\r\npossibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders\r\nor members.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204 (quoting\r\nBeaumont, 539 U. S., at 163). A rule that privileges the\r\nuse of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political\r\nspeech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent\r\nseeking behavior of executives and respects the views of\r\ndissenters. Austin’s acceptance of restrictions on general\r\ntreasury spending “simply allows people who have in­\r\nvested in the business corporation for purely economic\r\nreasons”—the vast majority of investors, one assumes—“to\r\navoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their\r\neconomic objectives.” Winkler, Beyond Bellotti, 32 Loyola\r\n(LA) L. Rev. 133, 201 (1998).\r\n    The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and\r\nunion members has a long history in campaign finance\r\n                    Cite as: 558 U.

It provided a central motivation for the Tillman\r\nAct in 1907 and subsequent legislation, see Pipefitters v.\r\nUnited States, 407 U. S. 385, 414–415 (1972); Winkler, 92\r\nGeo. L. J., at 887–900, and it has been endorsed in a long\r\nline of our cases, see, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204–\r\n205; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 152–154; MCFL, 479 U. S., at\r\n258; NRWC, 459 U. S., at 207–208; Pipefitters, 407 U. S.,\r\nat 414–416; see also n. 60, supra. Indeed, we have unani­\r\nmously recognized the governmental interest in “pro­\r\ntect[ing] the individuals who have paid money into a\r\ncorporation or union for purposes other than the support\r\nof candidates from having that money used to support\r\npolitical candidates to whom they may be opposed.”\r\nNRWC, 459 U. S., at 207–208.\r\n   The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that\r\nabuses of shareholder money can be corrected “through\r\nthe procedures of corporate democracy,” ante, at 46 (inter­\r\nnal quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through\r\nInternet-based disclosures, ante, at 55.76 I fail to under­\r\nstand how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union\r\nmembers, who will also be affected by today’s ruling, and I\r\nfail to understand why the Court is so confident in these\r\nmechanisms. By “corporate democracy,” presumably the\r\nCourt means the rights of shareholders to vote and to\r\nbring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In\r\npractice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you\r\nthat “these rights are so limited as to be almost nonexis­\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   76 I note that, among the many other regulatory possibilities it has\r\n\r\nleft open, ranging from new versions of §203 supported by additional\r\nevidence of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance to any number of\r\ntax incentive or public financing schemes, today’s decision does not\r\nrequire that a legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect\r\nshareholders. Legislatures remain free in their incorporation and tax\r\nlaws to condition the types of activity in which corporations may\r\nengage, including electioneering activity, on specific disclosure re­\r\nquirements or on prior express approval by shareholders or members.\r\n88    CITIZENS UNITED v.

Moreover, if the corpo­\r\nration in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees\r\nthe company’s ads may not know whether they are being\r\nfunded through the PAC or through the general treasury.\r\n   If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has\r\nbeen spending general treasury money on objectionable\r\nelectioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they\r\nreliably learn as much, however, this solution is only\r\npartial. The injury to the shareholders’ expressive rights\r\nhas already occurred; they might have preferred to keep\r\nthat corporation’s stock in their portfolio for any number\r\nof economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains\r\ntax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing\r\ntheir pension plan, or the like. The shareholder protection\r\nrationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that\r\ncorporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable\r\ncontributions in ways that any particular shareholder\r\nmight disapprove. But those expenditures do not impli­\r\ncate the selection of public officials, an area in which “the\r\ninterests of unwilling . . . corporate shareholders [in not\r\nbeing] forced to subsidize that speech” “are at their ze­\r\nnith.” Austin, 494 U. S., at 677 (Brennan, J., concurring).\r\nAnd in any event, the question is whether shareholder\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           89\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nprotection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in\r\nthe weeks before an election, not whether additional types\r\nof corporate communications might similarly be condi­\r\ntioned on voluntariness.\r\n   Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection\r\nrationale, the Austin Court did not hold it out as an ade­\r\nquate and independent ground for sustaining the statute\r\nin question. Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the\r\nantidistortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the\r\nproblem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if\r\nelectioneering expenditures can advance the political\r\nviews of some members of a corporation, they will often\r\ncompromise the views of others. See, e.g., id., at 663 (dis­\r\ncussing risk that corporation’s “members may be . . . reluc­\r\ntant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with\r\n[its] political expression”). Second, it provides an addi­\r\ntional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the\r\ncorporate form, for doubting that these “expenditures\r\nreflect actual public support for the political ideas es­\r\npoused,” id., at 660. The shareholder protection rationale,\r\nin other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on\r\ncorporate electioneering can serve both speakers’ and\r\nlisteners’ interests, as well as the anticorruption interest.\r\nAnd it supplies yet another reason why corporate expendi­\r\ntures merit less protection than individual expenditures.\r\n                              V\r\n   Today’s decision is backwards in many senses. It ele­\r\nvates the majority’s agenda over the litigants’ submis­\r\nsions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitu­\r\ntional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual\r\ndissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion\r\nover tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over\r\nreality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nAustin must be overruled and that §203 is facially uncon­\r\nstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and\r\n90    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nrationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or\r\nignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the\r\nCourt’s lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the\r\nsocietal interest in avoiding corruption and the appear­\r\nance of corruption does not provide an adequate justifica­\r\ntion for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate\r\nelections relies on an incorrect description of that interest,\r\nalong with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of estab­\r\nlished facts and the considered judgments of state and\r\nfederal legislatures over many decades.\r\n    In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on\r\nthe need to limit corporate campaign spending should\r\noutweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules. The\r\nmajority’s rejection of this principle “elevate[s] corpora­\r\ntions to a level of deference which has not been seen at\r\nleast since the days when substantive due process was\r\nregularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought\r\nto unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.”\r\nBellotti, 435 U. S., at 817, n. 13 (White, J., dissenting). At\r\nbottom, the Court’s opinion is thus a rejection of the com­\r\nmon sense of the American people, who have recognized a\r\nneed to prevent corporations from undermining self­\r\ngovernment since the founding, and who have fought\r\nagainst the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate\r\nelectioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a\r\nstrange time to repudiate that common sense. While\r\nAmerican democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority\r\nof this Court would have thought its flaws included a\r\ndearth of corporate money in politics.\r\n   I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Section 203 of the Bipartisan\r\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been\r\nreconcilable with that protection. By striking down §203,\r\nthe Court takes an important first step toward restoring\r\nfull constitutional protection to speech that is “indispensa­\r\nble to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of\r\npopular government.” McConnell v. Federal Election\r\nComm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 265 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring\r\nin part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in\r\npart) (internal quotation marks omitted). I dissent from\r\nPart IV of the Court’s opinion, however, because the\r\nCourt’s constitutional analysis does not go far enough.\r\nThe disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in\r\nBCRA §§201 and 311 are also unconstitutional. See id., at\r\n275–277, and n. 10.\r\n  Congress may not abridge the “right to anonymous\r\nspeech” based on the “ ‘simple interest in providing voters\r\nwith additional relevant information,’ ” id., at 276 (quoting\r\nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 348\r\n(1995)). In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court misap­\r\nprehends the import of “recent events” that some amici\r\n2      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\r\n\r\ndescribe “in which donors to certain causes were black­\r\nlisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.”\r\nAnte, at 54. The Court properly recognizes these events as\r\n“cause for concern,” ibid., but fails to acknowledge their\r\nconstitutional significance. In my view, amici’s submis­\r\nsions show why the Court’s insistence on upholding §§201\r\nand 311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated)\r\nas was its prior approval of §203.\r\n   Amici’s examples relate principally to Proposition 8, a\r\nstate ballot proposition that California voters narrowly\r\npassed in the 2008 general election.         Proposition 8\r\namended California’s constitution to provide that “[o]nly\r\nmarriage between a man and a woman is valid or recog­\r\nnized in California.” Cal. Const., Art. I, §7.5. Any donor\r\nwho gave more than $100 to any committee supporting or\r\nopposing Proposition 8 was required to disclose his full\r\nname, street address, occupation, employer’s name (or\r\nbusiness name, if self-employed), and the total amount of\r\nhis contributions.1 See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §84211(f)\r\n(West 2005). The California Secretary of State was then\r\nrequired to post this information on the Internet. See\r\n§§84600–84601; §§84602–84602.1 (West Supp. 2010);\r\n§§84602.5–84604 (West 2005); §85605 (West Supp. 2010);\r\n§§84606–84609 (West 2005).\r\n   Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this informa­\r\ntion and created Web sites with maps showing the loca­\r\ntions of homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters.\r\nMany supporters (or their customers) suffered property\r\ndamage, or threats of physical violence or death, as a\r\n——————\r\n  1 BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements.

They cited these incidents in a complaint they filed\r\nafter the 2008 election, seeking to invalidate California’s\r\nmandatory disclosure laws. Supporters recounted being\r\ntold: “Consider yourself lucky. If I had a gun I would have\r\ngunned you down along with each and every other sup­\r\nporter,” or, “we have plans for you and your friends.”\r\nComplaint in ProtectMarriage.com—Yes on 8 v. Bowen,\r\nCase No. 2:09–cv–00058–MCE–DAD (ED Cal.), ¶31.\r\nProposition 8 opponents also allegedly harassed the meas­\r\nure’s supporters by defacing or damaging their property.\r\nId., ¶32. Two religious organizations supporting Proposi­\r\ntion 8 reportedly received through the mail envelopes\r\ncontaining a white powdery substance. Id., ¶33.\r\n   Those accounts are consistent with media reports de­\r\nscribing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director of\r\nthe nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to\r\nsupport the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists\r\ncomplained to his employer. Lott & Smith, Donor Disclo­\r\nsure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26,\r\n2008, p. A13. The director of the Los Angeles Film Festi­\r\nval was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because oppo­\r\nnents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival.\r\nIbid. And a woman who had managed her popular, fam­\r\nily-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign\r\nafter she gave $100, because “throngs of [angry] protest­\r\ners” repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and “shout[ed]\r\n‘shame on you’ at customers.” Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Up­\r\nends Her Life, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1.\r\nThe police even had to “arriv[e] in riot gear one night to\r\nquell the angry mob” at the restaurant. Ibid. Some sup­\r\nporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real\r\nestate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a\r\ngroup opposing Proposition 8 “received a letter from the\r\nProp. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his\r\ncompany’s name if he didn’t also donate to the ‘Yes on 8’\r\ncampaign.” Donor Disclosure, supra, at A13.\r\n4     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\r\n\r\n   The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently\r\nspawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed\r\ndonor information to pre-empt citizens’ exercise of their\r\nFirst Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential\r\nelection, a “newly formed nonprofit group . . . plann[ed] to\r\nconfront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a\r\nchilling effect that will dry up contributions.” Luo, Group\r\nPlans Campaign Against G.O.P. Donors, N. Y. Times, Aug.\r\n8, 2008, p. A15. Its leader, “who described his effort as\r\n‘going for the jugular,’ ” detailed the group’s plan to send a\r\n“warning letter . . . alerting donors who might be consider­\r\ning giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential\r\ndangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and\r\nwatchdog groups digging through their lives.” Ibid.\r\n   These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate\r\nwhy this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure\r\nand reporting requirements. But amici present evidence\r\nof yet another reason to do so—the threat of retaliation\r\nfrom elected officials. As amici’s submissions make clear,\r\nthis threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition\r\nin California. For example, a candidate challenging an\r\nincumbent state attorney general reported that some\r\nmembers of the State’s business community feared donat­\r\ning to his campaign because they did not want to cross the\r\nincumbent; in his words, “ ‘I go to so many people and hear\r\nthe same thing: “I sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but\r\nI can’t afford to have my name on your records. He might\r\ncome after me next.” ’ ” Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism\r\nat the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11.\r\nThe incumbent won reelection in 2008.\r\n   My point is not to express any view on the merits of the\r\npolitical controversies I describe. Rather, it is to demon­\r\nstrate—using real-world, recent examples—the fallacy in\r\nthe Court’s conclusion that “[d]isclaimer and disclosure\r\nrequirements . . . impose no ceiling on campaign-related\r\nactivities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.”\r\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\r\n\r\nAnte, at 51 (internal quotation marks and citations omit­\r\nted). Of course they do. Disclaimer and disclosure re­\r\nquirements enable private citizens and elected officials to\r\nimplement political strategies specifically calculated to\r\ncurtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful,\r\npeaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.\r\n   The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied chal­\r\nlenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate\r\nthose speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can\r\n“show a reasonable probability that disclosure . . . will\r\nsubject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from\r\neither Government officials or private parties.” Ante, at 52\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court’s opin­\r\nion itself proves the irony in this compromise. In correctly\r\nexplaining why it must address the facial constitutionality\r\nof §203, see ante, at 5–20, the Court recognizes that “[t]he\r\nFirst Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers\r\nto . . . seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most\r\nsalient political issues of our day,” ante, at 7; that as­\r\napplied challenges to §203 “would require substantial\r\nlitigation over an extended time” and result in an “inter­\r\npretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable,\r\npervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech\r\npending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,\r\nwould themselves be questionable,” ante, at 9–10; that “a\r\ncourt would be remiss in performing its duties were it to\r\naccept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity\r\nof making a broader ruling,” ante, at 12; and that avoiding\r\na facial challenge to §203 “would prolong the substantial,\r\nnation-wide chilling effect” that §203 causes, ante, at 16.\r\nThis logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied chal­\r\nlenges to §§201 and 311.\r\n   Irony aside, the Court’s promise that as-applied chal­\r\nlenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assur­\r\nance. Now more than ever, §§201 and 311 will chill pro­\r\ntected speech because—as California voters can attest—\r\n6      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\r\n\r\n“the advent of the Internet” enables “prompt disclosure of\r\nexpenditures,” which “provide[s]” political opponents “with\r\nthe information needed” to intimidate and retaliate\r\nagainst their foes. Ante, at 55. Thus, “disclosure permits\r\ncitizens . . . to react to the speech of [their political oppo­\r\nnents] in a proper”—or undeniably improper—“way” long\r\nbefore a plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.2\r\nIbid.\r\n   I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment that\r\nsubjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined\r\ncareers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and\r\nthreatening warning letters as the price for engaging in\r\n“core political speech, the ‘primary object of First Amend­\r\nment protection.’ ” McConnell, 540 U.
