HOWARDS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11–262.     Argued March 21, 2012—Decided June 4, 2012\nPetitioners Reichle and Doyle were members of a Secret Service detail\n  protecting Vice President Richard Cheney while he greeted members\n  of the public at a shopping mall. Agent Doyle overheard respondent\n  Howards, who was speaking into his cell phone, state that he “was\n  going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he’s killed today.”\n  Doyle and other agents observed Howards enter the line to meet the\n  Vice President, tell the Vice President that his “policies in Iraq are\n  disgusting,” and touch the Vice President’s shoulder as the Vice Pres-\n  ident was leaving. After being briefed by Doyle, Agent Reichle inter-\n  viewed and then arrested Howards, who was charged with harass-\n  ment. After that charge was dismissed, Howards brought an action\n  against petitioners and others under 42 U. S. C. §1983 and Bivens v.\n  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388. Howards claimed\n  that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in viola-\n  tion of the Fourth Amendment, and that the arrest violated the First\n  Amendment because it was made in retaliation for Howards’ criti-\n  cism of the Vice President. Petitioners moved for summary judgment\n  on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the\n  Federal District Court denied the motion. On appeal, the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the Fourth\n  Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest\n  Howards, but the court affirmed with regard to the First Amendment\n  claim. In doing so, the court rejected petitioners’ argument that, un-\n  der Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, probable cause to arrest defeats\n  a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. It concluded instead\n  that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus\n  did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory\n  arrest violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable\n2                       REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    cause.\nHeld: Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because, at the\n time of Howards’ arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest\n supported by probable cause could give rise to a First Amendment vi-\n olation. Pp. 5−12.\n    (a) Courts may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a pur-\n ported right was not “clearly established” by prior case law. Pearson\n v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. To be clearly established, a right\n must be sufficiently clear “that every ‘reasonable official would [have\n understood] that what he is doing violates that right.’ ” Ashcroft v. al-\n Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5−6.\n    (b) The “clearly established” standard is not satisfied here. This\n Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from\n a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause; nor was such\n a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards’ arrest.\n P. 6.\n    (c) At that time, Hartman’s impact on the Tenth Circuit’s precedent\n was far from clear. Although Hartman’s facts involved only a retalia-\n tory prosecution, reasonable law enforcement officers could have\n questioned whether its rule also applied to arrests. First, Hartman\n was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest\n claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly. It resolved a\n Circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory\n prosecution claims, but some of the conflicting cases involved both re-\n taliatory prosecution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no dis-\n tinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable\n cause. Second, a reasonable official could have interpreted Hart-\n man’s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Like in retaliatory\n prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable\n cause for the arrest will be available in virtually all retaliatory arrest\n cases, and the causal link between the defendant’s alleged retaliatory\n animus and the plaintiff’s injury may be tenuous. Finally, decisions\n from other Circuits in the wake of Hartman support the conclusion\n that, for qualified immunity purposes, it was at least arguable at the\n time of Howards’ arrest that Hartman extended to retaliatory ar-\n rests.

STEVEN HOWARDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case requires us to decide whether two federal law\nenforcement agents are immune from suit for allegedly ar-\nresting a suspect in retaliation for his political speech, when\nthe agents had probable cause to arrest the suspect for\ncommitting a federal crime.\n                               I\n    On June 16, 2006, Vice President Richard Cheney vis-\nited a shopping mall in Beaver Creek, Colorado. A Secret\nService protective detail accompanied the Vice President.\nPetitioners Gus Reichle and Dan Doyle were members of\nthat detail.\n    Respondent Steven Howards was also at the mall. He\nwas engaged in a cell phone conversation when he noticed\nthe Vice President greeting members of the public. Agent\nDoyle overheard Howards say, during this conversation,\n“ ‘I’m going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he’s\nkilled today.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 4. Agent Doyle told\ntwo other agents what he had heard, and the three of\nthem began monitoring Howards more closely.\n    Agent Doyle watched Howards enter the line to meet\n2                      REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Vice President. When Howards approached the Vice\nPresident, he told him that his “ ‘policies in Iraq are dis-\ngusting.’ ” Ibid. The Vice President simply thanked How-\nards and moved along, but Howards touched the Vice\nPresident’s shoulder as the Vice President departed.1\nHowards then walked away.\n   Several agents observed Howards’ encounter with the\nVice President. The agents determined that Agent Reichle,\nwho coordinated the protective intelligence team respon-\nsible for interviewing individuals suspected of violat-\ning the law, should question Howards. Agent Reichle had\nnot personally heard Howards’ comments or seen his con-\ntact with the Vice President, but Agent Doyle briefed\nAgent Reichle on what had happened.\n   Agent Reichle approached Howards, presented his\nbadge and identified himself, and asked to speak with\nhim. Howards refused and attempted to walk away. At\nthat point, Agent Reichle stepped in front of Howards and\nasked if he had assaulted the Vice President. Pointing his\nfinger at Agent Reichle, Howards denied assaulting the\nVice President and told Agent Reichle, “if you don’t want\nother people sharing their opinions, you should have him\n[the Vice President] avoid public places.” Howards v.\nMcLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1137 (CA10 2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). During this exchange, Agent\nReichle also asked Howards whether he had touched the\nVice President. Howards falsely denied doing so. After\nconfirming that Agent Doyle had indeed seen Howards\ntouch the Vice President, Reichle arrested Howards.\n   The Secret Service transferred Howards to the custody\nof the local sheriff ’s department. Howards was charged by\nlocal officials with harassment in violation of state law.\n——————\n  1 The parties dispute the manner of the touch. Howards described it\n\nas an open-handed pat, while several Secret Service agents described it\nas a forceful push. This dispute does not affect our analysis.\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nThe charge was eventually dismissed.\n                              II\n   Howards brought this action in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Colorado under Rev. Stat.\n§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.\nNarcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).2 Howards alleged\nthat he was arrested and searched without probable cause,\nin violation of the Fourth Amendment. Howards also al-\nleged that he was arrested in retaliation for criticizing\nthe Vice President, in violation of the First Amendment.\n   Petitioners Reichle and Doyle moved for summary\njudgment on the ground that they were entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. The District Court denied the motion. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 46–61. On interlocutory appeal, a\ndivided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 634\nF. 3d 1131.\n   The Court of Appeals held that petitioners enjoyed\nqualified immunity with respect to Howards’ Fourth\nAmendment claim. The court concluded that petitioners\nhad probable cause to arrest Howards for making a mate-\nrially false statement to a federal official in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §1001 because he falsely denied touching the Vice\nPresident. 634 F. 3d, at 1142. Thus, the court concluded\nthat neither Howards’ arrest nor search incident to the\narrest violated the Fourth Amendment.3 Id., at 1142–\n1143.\n   However, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners quali-\nfied immunity from Howards’ First Amendment claim.\n——————\n  2 Howards named several Secret Service agents as defendants, but\n\nonly Agents Reichle and Doyle are petitioners here. We address only\nthose parts of the lower courts’ decisions that involve petitioners\nReichle and Doyle.\n  3 Howards does not challenge the Court of Appeals’ probable-cause\n\ndetermination.\n4                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court first determined that Howards had established\na material factual dispute regarding whether petitioners\nwere substantially motivated by Howards’ speech when\nthey arrested him. Id., at 1144–1145. The court then\nrejected petitioners’ argument that, under this Court’s\ndecision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), prob-\nable cause to arrest defeats a First Amendment claim of\nretaliatory arrest. The court concluded that Hartman\nestablished such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution\nclaims and, therefore, did not upset prior Tenth Circuit\nprecedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest\nviolates the First Amendment even if supported by proba-\nble cause. 634 F. 3d, at 1148.\n  Judge Paul Kelly dissented from the court’s denial of\nqualified immunity. He would have held that when How-\nards was arrested, it was not clearly established that an\narrest supported by probable cause could violate the First\nAmendment. In Judge Kelly’s view, Hartman called into\nserious question the Tenth Circuit’s prior precedent on\nretaliatory arrests. 634 F. 3d, at 1151. He noted that\nother Circuits had applied Hartman to retaliatory arrests\nand that there was a “strong argument” in favor of doing\nso. 634 F. 3d, at 1151–1152.\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: whether a First\nAmendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the\npresence of probable cause to support the arrest, and\nwhether clearly established law at the time of Howards’\narrest so held. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). If the answer\nto either question is “no,” then the agents are entitled to\nqualified immunity. We elect to address only the second\nquestion. We conclude that, at the time of Howards’ ar-\nrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest support-\ned by probable cause could violate the First Amendment.\nWe, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap-\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

See Ashcroft v. al-\nKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). In Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009), we held that courts\nmay grant qualified immunity on the ground that a pur-\nported right was not “clearly established” by prior case\nlaw, without resolving the often more difficult question\nwhether the purported right exists at all. Id., at 227. This\napproach comports with our usual reluctance to decide\nconstitutional questions unnecessarily. Id., at 241; see\nalso Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ – ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 9–10); al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n   To be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently\nclear “that every ‘reasonable official would [have under-\nstood] that what he is doing violates that right.’ ” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU. S. 635, 640 (1987)). In other words, “existing precedent\nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). This\n“clearly established” standard protects the balance be-\ntween vindication of constitutional rights and government\nofficials’ effective performance of their duties by ensuring\n——————\n   4 This Court has recognized an implied cause of action for damages\n\nagainst federal officials for Fourth Amendment violations. See Bivens\nv. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). We have\nnever held that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims. See\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 675 (2009) (assuming without deciding\nthat a First Amendment free exercise claim is actionable under Bivens);\nBush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 368 (1983) (refusing to extend Bivens to a\nFirst Amendment speech claim involving federal employment). We\nneed not (and do not) decide here whether Bivens extends to First\nAmendment retaliatory arrest claims.\n6                      REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat officials can “ ‘reasonably . . . anticipate when their\nconduct may give rise to liability for damages.’ ” Anderson,\nsupra, at 639 (quoting Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195\n(1984)).\n  The “clearly established” standard is not satisfied here.\nThis Court has never recognized a First Amendment right\nto be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by\nprobable cause; nor was such a right otherwise clearly\nestablished at the time of Howards’ arrest.\n                                A\n   Howards contends that our cases have “settled” the rule\nthat, “ ‘as a general matter[,] the First Amendment prohib-\nits government officials from subjecting an individual to\nretaliatory actions’ ” for his speech. See Brief for Respond-\nent 39 (quoting Hartman, supra, at 256). But we have\npreviously explained that the right allegedly violated must\nbe established, “ ‘not as a broad general proposition,’ ”\nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198 (2004)\n(per curiam), but in a “particularized” sense so that the\n“contours” of the right are clear to a reasonable official,\nAnderson, supra, at 640. Here, the right in question is not\nthe general right to be free from retaliation for one’s\nspeech, but the more specific right to be free from a retali-\natory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable\ncause. This Court has never held that there is such a\nright.5\n——————\n  5 The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.\n\n806 (1996), was misplaced. There, we held that a traffic stop supported\nby probable cause did not violate the Fourth Amendment regardless\nof the officer’s actual motivations, but we explained that the Equal\nProtection Clause would prohibit an officer from selectively enforcing\nthe traffic laws based on race. Id., at 813. Citing Whren, the Court of\nAppeals noted that “[i]t is well established that an act which is lawful\nunder the Fourth Amendment may still violate other provisions of the\nConstitution.” Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1149, n. 15\n(CA10 2011). But, again, we do not define clearly established law at\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   We next consider Tenth Circuit precedent. Assuming ar-\nguendo that controlling Court of Appeals’ authority could\nbe a dispositive source of clearly established law in the\ncircumstances of this case, the Tenth Circuit’s cases do not\nsatisfy the “clearly established” standard here.\n   Relying on DeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F. 2d 618 (1990), and\nPoole v. County of Otero, 271 F. 3d 955 (2001), the Court of\nAppeals concluded that, at the time of Howards’ arrest, its\nprecedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an\narrest in retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment\nrights, irrespective of probable cause. In DeLoach, a case\ninvolving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prose-\ncution, the court held that “[a]n act taken in retaliation for\nthe exercise of a constitutionally protected right is action-\nable under §1983 even if the act, when taken for a differ-\nent reason, would have been proper.” 922 F. 2d, at\n620 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Poole, a sub-\nsequent retaliatory prosecution case, the court relied on\nDeLoach for the proposition that a plaintiff ’s illegal con-\nduct is “not relevant to his First Amendment claim.” 271\nF. 3d, at 961.\n   The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Poole was\nabrogated by this Court’s subsequent decision in Hartman\nv. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, which held that a plaintiff cannot\nstate a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the\nFirst Amendment if the charges were supported by proba-\nble cause. But the Court of Appeals determined that\nHartman’s no-probable-cause requirement did not extend\nto claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb\n\n—————— \n\nsuch a “high level of generality.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n\n(2011) (slip op., at 10). Whren’s discussion of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment does not indicate, much less “clearly establish,” that an arrest\n\nsupported by probable cause could nonetheless violate the First\n\nAmendment. \n\n8                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits prior precedent in DeLoach. Accordingly, the court\nconcluded, “when Mr. Howards was arrested it was clearly\nestablished that an arrest made in retaliation of an indi-\nvidual’s First Amendment rights is unlawful, even if the\narrest is supported by probable cause.” 634 F. 3d, at 1148.\n   We disagree. At the time of Howards’ arrest, Hartman’s\nimpact on the Tenth Circuit’s precedent governing retal-\niatory arrests was far from clear. Although the facts of\nHartman involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reason-\nable officers could have questioned whether the rule of\nHartman also applied to arrests.\n   Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that\ntreated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly.\nHartman resolved a split among the Courts of Appeals\nabout the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prose-\ncution suits, but some of the conflicting court of appeals\ncases involved both an arrest and a prosecution that were\nalleged to be retaliation for the exercise of First Amend-\nment rights. See 547 U. S., at 255–256, 259, n. 6 (citing\nMozzochi v. Borden, 959 F. 2d 1174 (CA2 1992); Singer v.\nFulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F. 3d 110 (CA2 1995); Keenan v.\nTejeda, 290 F. 3d 252 (CA5 2002); Wood v. Kesler, 323\nF. 3d 872 (CA11 2003)). Those cases made no distinction\nbetween claims of retaliatory arrest and claims of retalia-\ntory prosecution when considering the relevance of prob-\nable cause. See Mozzochi, supra, at 1179–1180; Singer,\nsupra, at 120; Keenan, supra, at 260; Wood, supra, at 883.\nIndeed, the close relationship between retaliatory arrest\nand prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the Tenth\nCircuit’s own decision in DeLoach. DeLoach, too, involved\nallegations of both retaliatory arrest and retaliatory pros-\necution, and the Tenth Circuit analyzed the two claims as\none. 922 F. 2d, at 620–621.\n   A reasonable official also could have interpreted Hart-\nman’s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Hartman\nfirst observed that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, evi-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndence showing whether there was probable cause for the\ncharges would always be “available and apt to prove or\ndisprove retaliatory causation.” 547 U. S., at 261. In this\nCourt’s view, the presence of probable cause, while not\na “guarantee” that retaliatory motive did not cause the\nprosecution, still precluded any prima facie inference that\nretaliatory motive was the but-for cause of the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. Id., at 265. This was especially true because, as\nHartman next emphasized, retaliatory prosecution claims\ninvolve particularly attenuated causation between the de-\nfendant’s alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. Id., at 259–261. In a retaliatory prosecution case,\nthe key defendant is typically not the prosecutor who\nmade the charging decision that injured the plaintiff,\nbecause prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for their\ndecisions to prosecute. Rather, the key defendant is the\nperson who allegedly prompted the prosecutor’s decision.\nThus, the intervening decision of the third-party prosecu-\ntor widens the causal gap between the defendant’s animus\nand the plaintiff ’s injury. Id., at 261–263.\n  Like retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the pres-\nence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be\navailable in virtually every retaliatory arrest case. Such\nevidence could be thought similarly fatal to a plaintiff ’s\nclaim that animus caused his arrest, given that retaliatory\narrest cases also present a tenuous causal connection\nbetween the defendant’s alleged animus and the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. An officer might bear animus toward the content\nof a suspect’s speech. But the officer may decide to arrest\nthe suspect because his speech provides evidence of a\ncrime or suggests a potential threat. See, e.g., Wayte v.\nUnited States, 470 U. S. 598, 612–613 (1985) (noting that\nletters of protest written to the Selective Service, in which\nthe author expressed disagreement with the draft, “pro-\nvided strong, perhaps conclusive evidence” of the nonregis-\ntrant’s intent not to comply—one of the elements of the\n10                      REICHLE v.

Like\nretaliatory prosecution cases, then, the connection be-\ntween alleged animus and injury may be weakened in the\narrest context by a police officer’s wholly legitimate con-\nsideration of speech.\n   To be sure, we do not suggest that Hartman’s rule in\nfact extends to arrests. Nor do we suggest that every as-\npect of Hartman’s rationale could apply to retaliatory\narrests. Hartman concluded that the causal connection in\nretaliatory prosecution cases is attenuated because those\ncases necessarily involve the animus of one person and\nthe injurious action of another, 547 U. S., at 262, but in\nmany retaliatory arrest cases, it is the officer bearing the al-\nleged animus who makes the injurious arrest. Moreover,\nHartman noted that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, the\ncausal connection between the defendant’s animus and the\nprosecutor’s decision is further weakened by the “pre-\nsumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial deci-\nsionmaking.” Id., at 263. That presumption does not\napply here. Nonetheless, the fact remains that, for quali-\nfied immunity purposes, at the time of Howards’ arrest it\nwas at least arguable that Hartman’s rule extended to\nretaliatory arrests.6\n   Decisions from other Federal Courts of Appeals in the\nwake of Hartman support this assessment. Shortly before\n——————\n  6 Howards argues that petitioners violated his clearly established\n\nFirst Amendment right even if Hartman’s rule applies equally to\nretaliatory arrests. According to Howards, Hartman did not hold that a\nprosecution violates the First Amendment only when it is unsupported\nby probable cause. Rather, Howards argues, Hartman made probable\ncause relevant only to a plaintiff ’s ability to recover damages for a First\nAmendment violation. See Brief for Respondent 37–41. We need not\nresolve whether Hartman is best read as defining the scope of the First\nAmendment right or as simply establishing a prerequisite for recovery.\nNor need we decide whether that distinction matters. It suffices, for\nqualified immunity purposes, that the answer would not have been\nclear to a reasonable official when Howards was arrested.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nHowards’ arrest, the Sixth Circuit held that Hartman\nrequired a plaintiff alleging a retaliatory arrest to show\nthat the defendant officer lacked probable cause. See\nBarnes v. Wright, 449 F. 3d 709, 720 (2006) (reasoning\nthat the Hartman “rule sweeps broadly”). That court’s\ntreatment of Hartman confirms that the inapplicability of\nHartman to arrests would not have been clear to a reason-\nable officer when Howards was arrested. Moreover, since\nHowards’ arrest, additional Courts of Appeals have con-\ncluded that Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement\nextends to retaliatory arrests. See, e.g., McCabe v. Parker,\n608 F. 3d 1068, 1075 (CA8 2010); Phillips v. Irvin, 222\nFed. Appx. 928, 929 (CA11 2007) (per curiam). As we have\npreviously observed, “[i]f judges thus disagree on a consti-\ntutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money\ndamages for picking the losing side of the controversy.”\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999).7\n                        *     *   *\n  Hartman injected uncertainty into the law governing\nretaliatory arrests, particularly in light of Hartman’s\nrationale and the close relationship between retaliatory\narrest and prosecution claims. This uncertainty was only\nconfirmed by subsequent appellate decisions that disa-\ngreed over whether the reasoning in Hartman applied\nsimilarly to retaliatory arrests. Accordingly, when How-\nards was arrested it was not clearly established that an\narrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a\nFirst Amendment violation. Petitioners Reichle and Doyle\nare thus entitled to qualified immunity.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\n——————\n  7 Indeed, the Tenth Circuit itself has applied Hartman outside the\n\ncontext of retaliatory prosecution.

STEVEN HOWARDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n  Were defendants ordinary law enforcement officers, I\nwould hold that Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006),\ndoes not support their entitlement to qualified immunity.\nHartman involved a charge of retaliatory prosecution. As\nthe Court explains, the defendant in such a case cannot\nbe the prosecutor who made the decision to pursue charges.\nSee ante, at 9; Hartman, 547 U. S., at 262 (noting\nthat prosecutors are “absolutely immune from liability for\nthe decision to prosecute”). Rather, the defendant will be\nanother government official who, motivated by retaliatory\nanimus, convinced the prosecutor to act. See ibid.; ante, at\n9. Thus, the “causal connection [a plaintiff must establish\nin a retaliatory-prosecution case] is not merely between\nthe retaliatory animus of one person and that person’s\nown injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus\nof one person and the action of another.” Hartman, 547\nU. S., at 262. This “distinct problem of causation” justified\nthe absence-of-probable-cause requirement we recognized\nin Hartman. Id., at 263 (Proof of an absence of probable\ncause to prosecute is needed “to bridge the gap between\nthe nonprosecuting government agent’s motive and the\nprosecutor’s action.”). See also id., at 259 (“[T]he need to\nprove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with\n2                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n              GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndetails specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, . . . pro-\nvides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause\nrequirement.” (emphasis added)).\n  A similar causation problem will not arise in the typi-\ncal retaliatory-arrest case. Unlike prosecutors, arresting\nofficers are not wholly immune from suit. As a result, a\nplaintiff can sue the arresting officer directly and need\nonly show that the officer (not some other official) acted\nwith a retaliatory motive. Because, in the usual retaliatory-\narrest case, there is no gap to bridge between one gov-\nernment official’s animus and a second government offi-\ncial’s action, Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement is\ninapplicable.\n  Nevertheless, I concur in the Court’s judgment. Officers\nassigned to protect public officials must make singularly\nswift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the\nperson they are guarding is in jeopardy. In performing\nthat protective function, they rightly take into account\nwords spoken to, or in the proximity of, the person whose\nsafety is their charge. Whatever the views of Secret Ser-\nvice Agents Reichle and Doyle on the administration’s\npolicies in Iraq, they were duty bound to take the con-\ntent of Howards’ statements into account in determining\nwhether he posed an immediate threat to the Vice Presi-\ndent’s physical security. Retaliatory animus cannot be\ninferred from the assessment they made in that regard. If\nrational, that assessment should not expose them to\nclaims for civil damages. Cf. 18 U. S. C. §3056(d) (know-\ningly and willfully resisting federal law enforcement agent\nengaged in protective function is punishable by fine (up to\n$1,000) and imprisonment (up to one year)); §1751(e)\n(assaulting President or Vice President is a crime punish-\nable by fine and imprisonment up to ten years).\n</pre>", "id": 801500, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/04/reichle_v._howards.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 21, 2012—Decided June 4, 2012\nPetitioners Reichle and Doyle were members of a Secret Service detail\n  protecting Vice President Richard Cheney while he greeted members\n  of the public at a shopping mall. Agent Doyle overheard respondent\n  Howards, who was speaking into his cell phone, state that he “was\n  going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he’s killed today.”\n  Doyle and other agents observed Howards enter the line to meet the\n  Vice President, tell the Vice President that his “policies in Iraq are\n  disgusting,” and touch the Vice President’s shoulder as the Vice Pres-\n  ident was leaving. After being briefed by Doyle, Agent Reichle inter-\n  viewed and then arrested Howards, who was charged with harass-\n  ment. After that charge was dismissed, Howards brought an action\n  against petitioners and others under 42 U. S. C. §1983 and Bivens v.\n  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388. Howards claimed\n  that he was arrested and searched without probable cause, in viola-\n  tion of the Fourth Amendment, and that the arrest violated the First\n  Amendment because it was made in retaliation for Howards’ criti-\n  cism of the Vice President. Petitioners moved for summary judgment\n  on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the\n  Federal District Court denied the motion. On appeal, the Tenth Cir-\n  cuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the Fourth\n  Amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest\n  Howards, but the court affirmed with regard to the First Amendment\n  claim. In doing so, the court rejected petitioners’ argument that, un-\n  der Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, probable cause to arrest defeats\n  a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. It concluded instead\n  that Hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus\n  did not upset prior Tenth Circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory\n  arrest violates the First Amendment even if supported by probable\n2                       REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    cause.\nHeld: Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity because, at the\n time of Howards’ arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest\n supported by probable cause could give rise to a First Amendment vi-\n olation. Pp. 5−12.\n    (a) Courts may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a pur-\n ported right was not “clearly established” by prior case law. Pearson\n v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236. To be clearly established, a right\n must be sufficiently clear “that every ‘reasonable official would [have\n understood] that what he is doing violates that right.’ ” Ashcroft v. al-\n Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5−6.\n    (b) The “clearly established” standard is not satisfied here. This\n Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from\n a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause; nor was such\n a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards’ arrest.\n P. 6.\n    (c) At that time, Hartman’s impact on the Tenth Circuit’s precedent\n was far from clear. Although Hartman’s facts involved only a retalia-\n tory prosecution, reasonable law enforcement officers could have\n questioned whether its rule also applied to arrests. First, Hartman\n was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest\n claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly. It resolved a\n Circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory\n prosecution claims, but some of the conflicting cases involved both re-\n taliatory prosecution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no dis-\n tinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable\n cause. Second, a reasonable official could have interpreted Hart-\n man’s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Like in retaliatory\n prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable\n cause for the arrest will be available in virtually all retaliatory arrest\n cases, and the causal link between the defendant’s alleged retaliatory\n animus and the plaintiff’s injury may be tenuous. Finally, decisions\n from other Circuits in the wake of Hartman support the conclusion\n that, for qualified immunity purposes, it was at least arguable at the\n time of Howards’ arrest that Hartman extended to retaliatory ar-\n rests.

A Secret\nService protective detail accompanied the Vice President.\nPetitioners Gus Reichle and Dan Doyle were members of\nthat detail.\n    Respondent Steven Howards was also at the mall. He\nwas engaged in a cell phone conversation when he noticed\nthe Vice President greeting members of the public. Agent\nDoyle overheard Howards say, during this conversation,\n“ ‘I’m going to ask [the Vice President] how many kids he’s\nkilled today.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 4. Agent Doyle told\ntwo other agents what he had heard, and the three of\nthem began monitoring Howards more closely.\n    Agent Doyle watched Howards enter the line to meet\n2                      REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Vice President. When Howards approached the Vice\nPresident, he told him that his “ ‘policies in Iraq are dis-\ngusting.’ ” Ibid. The Vice President simply thanked How-\nards and moved along, but Howards touched the Vice\nPresident’s shoulder as the Vice President departed.1\nHowards then walked away.\n   Several agents observed Howards’ encounter with the\nVice President. The agents determined that Agent Reichle,\nwho coordinated the protective intelligence team respon-\nsible for interviewing individuals suspected of violat-\ning the law, should question Howards. Agent Reichle had\nnot personally heard Howards’ comments or seen his con-\ntact with the Vice President, but Agent Doyle briefed\nAgent Reichle on what had happened.\n   Agent Reichle approached Howards, presented his\nbadge and identified himself, and asked to speak with\nhim. Howards refused and attempted to walk away. At\nthat point, Agent Reichle stepped in front of Howards and\nasked if he had assaulted the Vice President. Pointing his\nfinger at Agent Reichle, Howards denied assaulting the\nVice President and told Agent Reichle, “if you don’t want\nother people sharing their opinions, you should have him\n[the Vice President] avoid public places.” Howards v.\nMcLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1137 (CA10 2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). During this exchange, Agent\nReichle also asked Howards whether he had touched the\nVice President. Howards falsely denied doing so. After\nconfirming that Agent Doyle had indeed seen Howards\ntouch the Vice President, Reichle arrested Howards.\n   The Secret Service transferred Howards to the custody\nof the local sheriff ’s department. Howards was charged by\nlocal officials with harassment in violation of state law.\n——————\n  1 The parties dispute the manner of the touch.

Stat.\n§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.\nNarcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).2 Howards alleged\nthat he was arrested and searched without probable cause,\nin violation of the Fourth Amendment. Howards also al-\nleged that he was arrested in retaliation for criticizing\nthe Vice President, in violation of the First Amendment.\n   Petitioners Reichle and Doyle moved for summary\njudgment on the ground that they were entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. The District Court denied the motion. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 46–61. On interlocutory appeal, a\ndivided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 634\nF. 3d 1131.\n   The Court of Appeals held that petitioners enjoyed\nqualified immunity with respect to Howards’ Fourth\nAmendment claim. The court concluded that petitioners\nhad probable cause to arrest Howards for making a mate-\nrially false statement to a federal official in violation of 18\nU. S. C. §1001 because he falsely denied touching the Vice\nPresident. 634 F. 3d, at 1142. Thus, the court concluded\nthat neither Howards’ arrest nor search incident to the\narrest violated the Fourth Amendment.3 Id., at 1142–\n1143.\n   However, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners quali-\nfied immunity from Howards’ First Amendment claim.\n——————\n  2 Howards named several Secret Service agents as defendants, but\n\nonly Agents Reichle and Doyle are petitioners here. We address only\nthose parts of the lower courts’ decisions that involve petitioners\nReichle and Doyle.\n  3 Howards does not challenge the Court of Appeals’ probable-cause\n\ndetermination.\n4                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court first determined that Howards had established\na material factual dispute regarding whether petitioners\nwere substantially motivated by Howards’ speech when\nthey arrested him. Id., at 1144–1145. The court then\nrejected petitioners’ argument that, under this Court’s\ndecision in Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), prob-\nable cause to arrest defeats a First Amendment claim of\nretaliatory arrest. The court concluded that Hartman\nestablished such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution\nclaims and, therefore, did not upset prior Tenth Circuit\nprecedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest\nviolates the First Amendment even if supported by proba-\nble cause. 634 F. 3d, at 1148.\n  Judge Paul Kelly dissented from the court’s denial of\nqualified immunity. He would have held that when How-\nards was arrested, it was not clearly established that an\narrest supported by probable cause could violate the First\nAmendment. In Judge Kelly’s view, Hartman called into\nserious question the Tenth Circuit’s prior precedent on\nretaliatory arrests. 634 F. 3d, at 1151. He noted that\nother Circuits had applied Hartman to retaliatory arrests\nand that there was a “strong argument” in favor of doing\nso. 634 F. 3d, at 1151–1152.\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: whether a First\nAmendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the\npresence of probable cause to support the arrest, and\nwhether clearly established law at the time of Howards’\narrest so held. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). If the answer\nto either question is “no,” then the agents are entitled to\nqualified immunity. We elect to address only the second\nquestion. We conclude that, at the time of Howards’ ar-\nrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest support-\ned by probable cause could violate the First Amendment.\nWe, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap-\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S. 194, 198 (2004)\n(per curiam), but in a “particularized” sense so that the\n“contours” of the right are clear to a reasonable official,\nAnderson, supra, at 640. Here, the right in question is not\nthe general right to be free from retaliation for one’s\nspeech, but the more specific right to be free from a retali-\natory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable\ncause. This Court has never held that there is such a\nright.5\n——————\n  5 The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.\n\n806 (1996), was misplaced. There, we held that a traffic stop supported\nby probable cause did not violate the Fourth Amendment regardless\nof the officer’s actual motivations, but we explained that the Equal\nProtection Clause would prohibit an officer from selectively enforcing\nthe traffic laws based on race. Id., at 813. Citing Whren, the Court of\nAppeals noted that “[i]t is well established that an act which is lawful\nunder the Fourth Amendment may still violate other provisions of the\nConstitution.” Howards v. McLaughlin, 634 F. 3d 1131, 1149, n. 15\n(CA10 2011). But, again, we do not define clearly established law at\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   We next consider Tenth Circuit precedent. Assuming ar-\nguendo that controlling Court of Appeals’ authority could\nbe a dispositive source of clearly established law in the\ncircumstances of this case, the Tenth Circuit’s cases do not\nsatisfy the “clearly established” standard here.\n   Relying on DeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F. 2d 618 (1990), and\nPoole v. County of Otero, 271 F. 3d 955 (2001), the Court of\nAppeals concluded that, at the time of Howards’ arrest, its\nprecedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an\narrest in retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment\nrights, irrespective of probable cause. In DeLoach, a case\ninvolving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prose-\ncution, the court held that “[a]n act taken in retaliation for\nthe exercise of a constitutionally protected right is action-\nable under §1983 even if the act, when taken for a differ-\nent reason, would have been proper.” 922 F. 2d, at\n620 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Poole, a sub-\nsequent retaliatory prosecution case, the court relied on\nDeLoach for the proposition that a plaintiff ’s illegal con-\nduct is “not relevant to his First Amendment claim.” 271\nF. 3d, at 961.\n   The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Poole was\nabrogated by this Court’s subsequent decision in Hartman\nv. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, which held that a plaintiff cannot\nstate a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the\nFirst Amendment if the charges were supported by proba-\nble cause. But the Court of Appeals determined that\nHartman’s no-probable-cause requirement did not extend\nto claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb\n\n—————— \n\nsuch a “high level of generality.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n\n(2011) (slip op., at 10). Whren’s discussion of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment does not indicate, much less “clearly establish,” that an arrest\n\nsupported by probable cause could nonetheless violate the First\n\nAmendment. \n\n8                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits prior precedent in DeLoach. Accordingly, the court\nconcluded, “when Mr. Howards was arrested it was clearly\nestablished that an arrest made in retaliation of an indi-\nvidual’s First Amendment rights is unlawful, even if the\narrest is supported by probable cause.” 634 F. 3d, at 1148.\n   We disagree. At the time of Howards’ arrest, Hartman’s\nimpact on the Tenth Circuit’s precedent governing retal-\niatory arrests was far from clear. Although the facts of\nHartman involved only a retaliatory prosecution, reason-\nable officers could have questioned whether the rule of\nHartman also applied to arrests.\n   Hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that\ntreated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly.\nHartman resolved a split among the Courts of Appeals\nabout the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prose-\ncution suits, but some of the conflicting court of appeals\ncases involved both an arrest and a prosecution that were\nalleged to be retaliation for the exercise of First Amend-\nment rights. See 547 U. S., at 255–256, 259, n. 6 (citing\nMozzochi v. Borden, 959 F. 2d 1174 (CA2 1992); Singer v.\nFulton Cty. Sheriff, 63 F. 3d 110 (CA2 1995); Keenan v.\nTejeda, 290 F. 3d 252 (CA5 2002); Wood v. Kesler, 323\nF. 3d 872 (CA11 2003)). Those cases made no distinction\nbetween claims of retaliatory arrest and claims of retalia-\ntory prosecution when considering the relevance of prob-\nable cause. See Mozzochi, supra, at 1179–1180; Singer,\nsupra, at 120; Keenan, supra, at 260; Wood, supra, at 883.\nIndeed, the close relationship between retaliatory arrest\nand prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the Tenth\nCircuit’s own decision in DeLoach. DeLoach, too, involved\nallegations of both retaliatory arrest and retaliatory pros-\necution, and the Tenth Circuit analyzed the two claims as\none. 922 F. 2d, at 620–621.\n   A reasonable official also could have interpreted Hart-\nman’s rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests. Hartman\nfirst observed that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, evi-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndence showing whether there was probable cause for the\ncharges would always be “available and apt to prove or\ndisprove retaliatory causation.” 547 U. S., at 261. In this\nCourt’s view, the presence of probable cause, while not\na “guarantee” that retaliatory motive did not cause the\nprosecution, still precluded any prima facie inference that\nretaliatory motive was the but-for cause of the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. Id., at 265. This was especially true because, as\nHartman next emphasized, retaliatory prosecution claims\ninvolve particularly attenuated causation between the de-\nfendant’s alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. Id., at 259–261. In a retaliatory prosecution case,\nthe key defendant is typically not the prosecutor who\nmade the charging decision that injured the plaintiff,\nbecause prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for their\ndecisions to prosecute. Rather, the key defendant is the\nperson who allegedly prompted the prosecutor’s decision.\nThus, the intervening decision of the third-party prosecu-\ntor widens the causal gap between the defendant’s animus\nand the plaintiff ’s injury. Id., at 261–263.\n  Like retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the pres-\nence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be\navailable in virtually every retaliatory arrest case. Such\nevidence could be thought similarly fatal to a plaintiff ’s\nclaim that animus caused his arrest, given that retaliatory\narrest cases also present a tenuous causal connection\nbetween the defendant’s alleged animus and the plaintiff ’s\ninjury. An officer might bear animus toward the content\nof a suspect’s speech. But the officer may decide to arrest\nthe suspect because his speech provides evidence of a\ncrime or suggests a potential threat. See, e.g., Wayte v.\nUnited States, 470 U. S. 598, 612–613 (1985) (noting that\nletters of protest written to the Selective Service, in which\nthe author expressed disagreement with the draft, “pro-\nvided strong, perhaps conclusive evidence” of the nonregis-\ntrant’s intent not to comply—one of the elements of the\n10                      REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\noffense” of willful failure to register for the draft). Like\nretaliatory prosecution cases, then, the connection be-\ntween alleged animus and injury may be weakened in the\narrest context by a police officer’s wholly legitimate con-\nsideration of speech.\n   To be sure, we do not suggest that Hartman’s rule in\nfact extends to arrests. Nor do we suggest that every as-\npect of Hartman’s rationale could apply to retaliatory\narrests. Hartman concluded that the causal connection in\nretaliatory prosecution cases is attenuated because those\ncases necessarily involve the animus of one person and\nthe injurious action of another, 547 U. S., at 262, but in\nmany retaliatory arrest cases, it is the officer bearing the al-\nleged animus who makes the injurious arrest. Moreover,\nHartman noted that, in retaliatory prosecution cases, the\ncausal connection between the defendant’s animus and the\nprosecutor’s decision is further weakened by the “pre-\nsumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial deci-\nsionmaking.” Id., at 263. That presumption does not\napply here. Nonetheless, the fact remains that, for quali-\nfied immunity purposes, at the time of Howards’ arrest it\nwas at least arguable that Hartman’s rule extended to\nretaliatory arrests.6\n   Decisions from other Federal Courts of Appeals in the\nwake of Hartman support this assessment. Shortly before\n——————\n  6 Howards argues that petitioners violated his clearly established\n\nFirst Amendment right even if Hartman’s rule applies equally to\nretaliatory arrests. According to Howards, Hartman did not hold that a\nprosecution violates the First Amendment only when it is unsupported\nby probable cause. Rather, Howards argues, Hartman made probable\ncause relevant only to a plaintiff ’s ability to recover damages for a First\nAmendment violation. See Brief for Respondent 37–41. We need not\nresolve whether Hartman is best read as defining the scope of the First\nAmendment right or as simply establishing a prerequisite for recovery.\nNor need we decide whether that distinction matters. It suffices, for\nqualified immunity purposes, that the answer would not have been\nclear to a reasonable official when Howards was arrested.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nHowards’ arrest, the Sixth Circuit held that Hartman\nrequired a plaintiff alleging a retaliatory arrest to show\nthat the defendant officer lacked probable cause. See\nBarnes v. Wright, 449 F. 3d 709, 720 (2006) (reasoning\nthat the Hartman “rule sweeps broadly”). That court’s\ntreatment of Hartman confirms that the inapplicability of\nHartman to arrests would not have been clear to a reason-\nable officer when Howards was arrested. Moreover, since\nHowards’ arrest, additional Courts of Appeals have con-\ncluded that Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement\nextends to retaliatory arrests. See, e.g., McCabe v. Parker,\n608 F. 3d 1068, 1075 (CA8 2010); Phillips v. Irvin, 222\nFed. Appx. 928, 929 (CA11 2007) (per curiam). As we have\npreviously observed, “[i]f judges thus disagree on a consti-\ntutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money\ndamages for picking the losing side of the controversy.”\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999).7\n                        *     *   *\n  Hartman injected uncertainty into the law governing\nretaliatory arrests, particularly in light of Hartman’s\nrationale and the close relationship between retaliatory\narrest and prosecution claims. This uncertainty was only\nconfirmed by subsequent appellate decisions that disa-\ngreed over whether the reasoning in Hartman applied\nsimilarly to retaliatory arrests. Accordingly, when How-\nards was arrested it was not clearly established that an\narrest supported by probable cause could give rise to a\nFirst Amendment violation. Petitioners Reichle and Doyle\nare thus entitled to qualified immunity.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\n——————\n  7 Indeed, the Tenth Circuit itself has applied Hartman outside the\n\ncontext of retaliatory prosecution.

Himes, 598 F. 3d 708,\n719 (2010) (requiring the absence of probable cause in the context of a\nclaim alleging that government officials suspended a business license in\nretaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights).\n12                REICHLE v.

Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006),\ndoes not support their entitlement to qualified immunity.\nHartman involved a charge of retaliatory prosecution. As\nthe Court explains, the defendant in such a case cannot\nbe the prosecutor who made the decision to pursue charges.\nSee ante, at 9; Hartman, 547 U. S., at 262 (noting\nthat prosecutors are “absolutely immune from liability for\nthe decision to prosecute”). Rather, the defendant will be\nanother government official who, motivated by retaliatory\nanimus, convinced the prosecutor to act. See ibid.; ante, at\n9. Thus, the “causal connection [a plaintiff must establish\nin a retaliatory-prosecution case] is not merely between\nthe retaliatory animus of one person and that person’s\nown injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus\nof one person and the action of another.” Hartman, 547\nU. S., at 262. This “distinct problem of causation” justified\nthe absence-of-probable-cause requirement we recognized\nin Hartman. Id., at 263 (Proof of an absence of probable\ncause to prosecute is needed “to bridge the gap between\nthe nonprosecuting government agent’s motive and the\nprosecutor’s action.”). See also id., at 259 (“[T]he need to\nprove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with\n2                  REICHLE v. HOWARDS\n\n              GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndetails specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, . . . pro-\nvides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause\nrequirement.” (emphasis added)).\n  A similar causation problem will not arise in the typi-\ncal retaliatory-arrest case. Unlike prosecutors, arresting\nofficers are not wholly immune from suit. As a result, a\nplaintiff can sue the arresting officer directly and need\nonly show that the officer (not some other official) acted\nwith a retaliatory motive. Because, in the usual retaliatory-\narrest case, there is no gap to bridge between one gov-\nernment official’s animus and a second government offi-\ncial’s action, Hartman’s no-probable-cause requirement is\ninapplicable.\n  Nevertheless, I concur in the Court’s judgment. Officers\nassigned to protect public officials must make singularly\nswift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the\nperson they are guarding is in jeopardy. In performing\nthat protective function, they rightly take into account\nwords spoken to, or in the proximity of, the person whose\nsafety is their charge. Whatever the views of Secret Ser-\nvice Agents Reichle and Doyle on the administration’s\npolicies in Iraq, they were duty bound to take the con-\ntent of Howards’ statements into account in determining\nwhether he posed an immediate threat to the Vice Presi-\ndent’s physical security. Retaliatory animus cannot be\ninferred from the assessment they made in that regard. If\nrational, that assessment should not expose them to\nclaims for civil damages. Cf. 18 U. S. C. §3056(d) (know-\ningly and willfully resisting federal law enforcement agent\nengaged in protective function is punishable by fine (up to\n$1,000) and imprisonment (up to one year)); §1751(e)\n(assaulting President or Vice President is a crime punish-\nable by fine and imprisonment up to ten years).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/801500/", "sha1": "18fa69f6d8e311f80cb44e12b36af20712a18abd", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-06-04T07:42:57"}
