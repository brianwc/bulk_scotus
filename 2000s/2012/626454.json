Argued October 12, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012\nPetitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state\n  trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a\n  bench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest after he failed to appear\n  at a hearing to enforce a fine. He was initially detained in the Bur-\n  lington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Cor-\n  rectional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the\n  fine had been paid. At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming\n  detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for\n  scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed. Petition-\n  er claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out\n  his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. At the second jail, peti-\n  tioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while\n  an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an\n  officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arm-\n  pits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his\n  clothes examined. Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift\n  his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting. He filed a 42\n  U. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the gov-\n  ernment entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging\n  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that per-\n  sons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive\n  searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of\n  weapons, drugs, or other contraband. The court granted him sum-\n  mary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” nonindictable offenders\n  without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment. The\n  Third Circuit reversed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2     FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                 COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n621 F. 3d 296, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails\n  struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of\n  the institutions, and thus the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n  do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro-\n  poses. Pp. 5−18, 19.\n     (a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the\n  expertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discre-\n  tion to devise reasonable solutions to problems. A regulation imping-\n  ing on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is rea-\n  sonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley,\n  482 U. S. 78, 89. This Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558,\n  upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional fa-\n  cilities “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of\n  a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from\n  outside the institution[s],” deferring to the judgment of correctional\n  officials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to\n  deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.\n  In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586−587, the Court upheld a\n  general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling\n  threat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions\n  for certain detainees. The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,\n  522−523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband\n  depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable\n  exceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of\n  inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is\n  concealing a prohibited item. These cases establish that correctional\n  officials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to de-\n  tect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and\n  that “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\n  that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considera-\n  tions courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\n  matters,” Block, supra, at 584–585.\n     Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to\n  be processed at jails. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354.\n  Pp. 5−9.\n     (b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives\n  involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detain-\n  ees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue ab-\n  sent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.\n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thor-\n  ough search as a standard part of the intake process. The admission\n  of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee popula-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntion, and the new detainees themselves. Officials therefore must\nscreen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring\nimmediate medical attention. It may be difficult to identify and treat\nmedical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual in-\nspection. Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving\nthem reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for\nsigns of gang affiliation as part of the intake process. Additionally,\ncorrectional officials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and\nother prohibited items new detainees may possess. Drugs can make\ninmates aggressive toward officers or each other, and drug trading\ncan lead to violent confrontations. Contraband has value in a jail’s\nculture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods\ncan lead to violence, extortion, and disorder. Pp. 9−13.\n   (c) Petitioner’s proposal―that new detainees not arrested for seri-\nous crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from\ninvasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to sus-\npect them of hiding contraband―is unworkable. The seriousness of\nan offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be\ndifficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the\nproposed exemption. Even persons arrested for a minor offense may\nbe coerced by others into concealing contraband. Exempting people\narrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may\nput them at greater risk and result in more contraband being\nbrought into the detention facility.\n   It also may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and pri-\nor offenses before the intake search. Jail officials know little at the\noutset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about\nhis identity. The officers conducting an initial search often do not\nhave access to criminal history records. And those records can be in-\naccurate or incomplete. Even with accurate information, officers\nwould encounter serious implementation difficulties. They would be\nrequired to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were\nserious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol. Other\npossible classifications based on characteristics of individual detain-\nees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of\ndiscriminatory application. To avoid liability, officers might be in-\nclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creat-\ning unnecessary risk for the entire jail population. While the re-\nstrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy\nof some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to eve-\nryone in the facility, including the less serious offenders. The Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed\nframework. Pp. 13−18, 19.\n4     FLORENCE v.

FLORENCE, PETITIONER v. BOARD OF\n\n   CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF\n\n             BURLINGTON ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 2, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Part IV.*\n  Correctional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed\na responsibility, to ensure that jails are not made less\nsecure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on\ntheir bodies. Facility personnel, other inmates, and the\nnew detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these\nthreats are introduced into the jail population. This case\npresents the question of what rules, or limitations, the\nConstitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who\nare to be held in jail while their cases are being processed.\nThe term “jail” is used here in a broad sense to include\nprisons and other detention facilities.         The specific\nmeasures being challenged will be described in more\ndetail; but, in broad terms, the controversy concerns\nwhether every detainee who will be admitted to the gen-\neral population may be required to undergo a close visual\ninspection while undressed.\n  The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court\n——————\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV of this opinion.\n2    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhas sufficient expertise and information in the record to\nmandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions\nand limitations sought by those who challenge the visual\nsearch procedures at issue. In addressing this type of\nconstitutional claim courts must defer to the judgment of\ncorrectional officials unless the record contains substantial\nevidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or un-\njustified response to problems of jail security. That\nnecessary showing has not been made in this case.\n                              I\n   In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, peti-\ntioner Albert Florence was arrested after fleeing from\npolice officers in Essex County, New Jersey. He was\ncharged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly\nweapon. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser\noffenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly in-\nstallments. In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments\nand failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench\nwarrant was issued for his arrest. He paid the outstand-\ning balance less than a week later; but, for some unex-\nplained reason, the warrant remained in a statewide\ncomputer database.\n   Two years later, in Burlington County, New Jersey,\npetitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile\nby a state trooper. Based on the outstanding warrant in\nthe computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and\ntook him to the Burlington County Detention Center. He\nwas held there for six days and then was transferred to\nthe Essex County Correctional Facility. It is not the ar-\nrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that\ngives rise to the claims before the Court.\n   Burlington County jail procedures required every ar-\nrestee to shower with a delousing agent. Officers would\ncheck arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contra-\nband as they disrobed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner claims he was also instructed to open his\nmouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and\nlift his genitals. (It is not clear whether this last step was\npart of the normal practice. See ibid.) Petitioner shared a\ncell with at least one other person and interacted with\nother inmates following his admission to the jail. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17.\n   The Essex County Correctional Facility, where peti-\ntioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail\nin New Jersey. App. 70a. It admits more than 25,000 in-\nmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at\nany given time. When petitioner was transferred there,\nall arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and\nwaited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.\nWhen they left the holding cell, they were instructed to\nremove their clothing while an officer looked for body\nmarkings, wounds, and contraband. Apparently without\ntouching the detainees, an officer looked at their ears,\nnose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits,\nand other body openings. Id., at 57a–59a; App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 137a–144a. This policy applied regardless of the\ncircumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the\ndetainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history. Peti-\ntioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn\naround, and cough in a squatting position as part of the\nprocess. After a mandatory shower, during which his\nclothes were inspected, petitioner was admitted to the\nfacility. App. 3a–4a, 52a, 258a. He was released the next\nday, when the charges against him were dismissed.\n   Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated\nthe jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants.\nThe suit was commenced in the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey. Seeking relief under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 for violations of his Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that per-\nsons arrested for a minor offense could not be required\n4    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto remove their clothing and expose the most private areas\nof their bodies to close visual inspection as a routine part\nof the intake process. Rather, he contended, officials could\nconduct this kind of search only if they had reason to\nsuspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs,\nor other contraband. The District Court certified a class of\nindividuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense\nunder New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington\nCounty or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked\neven though an officer had not articulated any reasonable\nsuspicion they were concealing contraband.\n   After discovery, the court granted petitioner’s motion\nfor summary judgment on the unlawful search claim. It\nconcluded that any policy of “strip searching” nonindict-\nable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the\nFourth Amendment. A divided panel of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding\nthat the procedures described by the District Court struck\na reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the\nsecurity needs of the two jails. 621 F. 3d 296 (2010). The\ncase proceeds on the understanding that the officers\nsearched detainees prior to their admission to the general\npopulation, as the Court of Appeals seems to have as-\nsumed. See id., at 298, 311. Petitioner has not argued\nthis factual premise is incorrect.\n   The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on file,\nand some cases of this Court refer to a “strip search.” The\nterm is imprecise. It may refer simply to the instruction\nto remove clothing while an officer observes from a dis-\ntance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual in-\nspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it\nmay include directing detainees to shake their heads or to\nrun their hands through their hair to dislodge what might\nbe hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise\narms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the\nears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncough in a squatting position. In the instant case, the\nterm does not include any touching of unclothed areas\nby the inspecting officer. There are no allegations that\nthe detainees here were touched in any way as part of the\nsearches.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing\nconclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires\ncorrectional officials to exempt some detainees who will be\nadmitted to a jail’s general population from the searches\nhere at issue. This Court granted certiorari to address the\nquestion. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The difficulties of operating a detention center must not\nbe underestimated by the courts. Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 84–85 (1987). Jails (in the stricter sense of\nthe term, excluding prison facilities) admit more than 13\nmillion inmates a year. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear\n2010—Statistical Tables 2 (2011). The largest facilities\nprocess hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be\ncrowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation,\nor because of detainees arriving from other jurisdictions.\nMaintaining safety and order at these institutions re-\nquires the expertise of correctional officials, who must\nhave substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions\nto the problems they face. The Court has confirmed the\nimportance of deference to correctional officials and ex-\nplained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s consti-\ntutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests.” Turner, supra, at 89;\nsee Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131–132 (2003).\nBut see Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 510–511\n(2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications).\n  The Court’s opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520\n(1979), is the starting point for understanding how this\n6    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nframework applies to Fourth Amendment challenges.\nThat case addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees\nin any correctional facility run by the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection\nas a part of a strip search conducted after every contact\nvisit with a person from outside the institution.” Id., at\n558. Inmates at the federal Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter in New York City argued there was no security\njustification for these searches. Officers searched guests\nbefore they entered the visiting room, and the inmates\nwere under constant surveillance during the visit. Id., at\n577–578 (Marshall, J., dissenting). There had been but\none instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak con-\ntraband back into the facility. See id., at 559 (majority\nopinion). The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy.\nIt deferred to the judgment of correctional officials that\nthe inspections served not only to discover but also to\ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohib-\nited items inside. Id., at 558. The Court explained that\nthere is no mechanical way to determine whether intru-\nsions on an inmate’s privacy are reasonable. Id., at 559.\nThe need for a particular search must be balanced against\nthe resulting invasion of personal rights. Ibid.\n   Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and\nprisons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell. In\nBlock v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the\nCourt concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could\nban all contact visits because of the threat they posed:\n    “They open the institution to the introduction of\n    drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can\n    easily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contra-\n    band in countless ways and pass them to an inmate\n    unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And\n    these items can readily be slipped from the clothing of\n    an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    permitted close contact with inmates.” Id., at 586.\nThere were “many justifications” for imposing a general\nban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain\ndetainees. Id., at 587. Among other problems, it would be\n“a difficult if not impossible task” to identify “inmates who\nhave propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.”\nIbid. This was made “even more difficult by the brevity of\ndetention and the constantly changing nature of the in-\nmate population.” Ibid.\n   The Court has also recognized that deterring the posses-\nsion of contraband depends in part on the ability to con-\nduct searches without predictable exceptions. In Hudson\nv. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question\nof whether prison officials could perform random searches\nof inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect\na particular individual of concealing a prohibited item.\nId., at 522–523. The Court upheld the constitutionality of\nthe practice, recognizing that “ ‘[f]or one to advocate that\nprison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an\nenunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at\na particular inmate is to ignore the realities of prison\noperation.’ ” Id., at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Common-\nwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)).\nInmates would adapt to any pattern or loopholes they\ndiscovered in the search protocol and then undermine the\nsecurity of the institution. 468 U. S., at 529.\n   These cases establish that correctional officials must be\npermitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect\nand deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.\nSee Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (“[M]aintaining institutional\nsecurity and preserving internal order and discipline are\nessential goals that may require limitation or retraction of\nretained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners\nand pretrial detainees”).

This Court\nhas repeated the admonition that, “ ‘in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these consid-\nerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert\njudgment in such matters.’ ” Block, supra, at 584–585;\nBell, supra, at 548.\n   In many jails officials seek to improve security by re-\nquiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be\ndetained. These procedures have been used in different\nplaces throughout the country, from Cranston, Rhode\nIsland, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho. See\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 108–109 (CA1\n2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d 393, 394 (CA10\n1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984)\n(per curiam); see also, e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San\nFrancisco, 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Fran-\ncisco, California); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11\n2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v. Crouch, 872\nF. 2d 1248, 1251 (CA6 1989) (Jefferson Cty., Ky.); Weber v.\nDell, 804 F. 2d 796, 797–798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty.,\nN. Y.); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5\n1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.).\n   Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the\ndetainees processed at these facilities. This is, in part, a\nconsequence of the exercise of state authority that was the\nsubject of Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).\nAtwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental ques-\ntion of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in\nthe first place. The case involved a woman who was ar-\nrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her\nchildren were wearing their seatbelts.

The Court held that a Fourth\nAmendment restriction on this power would put officers in\nan “almost impossible spot.” Id., at 350. Their ability to\narrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the pre-\ncise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat\noffender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling\nneed to detain someone. Id., at 348–349. The Court re-\njected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred\ncustodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of\nconstitutional law. It ruled, based on established princi-\nples, that officers may make an arrest based upon proba-\nble cause to believe the person has committed a criminal\noffense in their presence. See id., at 354. The Court\nstated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is\nnot well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-by-\ncase determinations of government need, lest every discre-\ntionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion\nfor constitutional review.” Id., at 347.\n   Atwater did not address whether the Constitution im-\nposes special restrictions on the searches of offenders\nsuspected of committing minor offenses once they are\ntaken to jail. Some Federal Courts of Appeals have held\nthat corrections officials may not conduct a strip search of\nthese detainees, even if no touching is involved, absent\nreasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. 621 F. 3d,\nat 303–304, and n. 4. The Courts of Appeals to address\nthis issue in the last decade, however, have come to the\nopposite conclusion. See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame\nv. Dillard, 637 F. 3d 380 (CADC 2011); Powell, supra;\nBull, supra.

The\nCourt has held that deference must be given to the offi-\ncials in charge of the jail unless there is “substantial\nevidence” demonstrating their response to the situation is\nexaggerated. Block, 468 U. S., at 584–585 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Petitioner has not met this standard,\nand the record provides full justifications for the proce-\ndures used.\n                                A\n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in con-\nducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake\nprocess. The admission of inmates creates numerous risks\nfor facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and\nfor a new detainee himself or herself. The danger of intro-\nducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well\ndocumented. See, e.g., Deger & Quick, The Enduring\nMenace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention\nin a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174–\n175, 177–178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and\nPrisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007).\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons recommends that staff\nscreen new detainees for these conditions. See Clinical\nPractice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clini-\ncal Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011).\nPersons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries\nrequiring immediate medical attention. It may be difficult\nto identify and treat these problems until detainees re-\nmove their clothes for a visual inspection. See Prison and\nJail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P.

The groups recruit new members by\nforce, engage in assaults against staff, and give other\ninmates a reason to arm themselves. Ibid. Fights among\nfeuding gangs can be deadly, and the officers who must\nmaintain order are put in harm’s way. PBA Brief 17.\nThese considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify\na visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of\ngang affiliation as part of the intake process. The identi-\nfication and isolation of gang members before they are\nadmitted protects everyone in the facility. Cf. Fraise v.\nTerhune, 283 F. 3d 506, 509–510 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.)\n(describing a statewide policy authorizing the identifica-\ntion and isolation of gang members in prison).\n   Detecting contraband concealed by new detainees, fur-\nthermore, is a most serious responsibility. Weapons,\ndrugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a jail.\nCf. Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528 (recognizing “the constant\nfight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit\ndrugs, and other contraband”). Correctional officers have\nhad to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor\nblades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their\nperson, including in their body cavities. See Bull, 595\nF. 3d, at 967, 969; Brief for New Jersey County Jail War-\ndens Association as Amicus Curiae 17–18 (hereinafter\nNew Jersey Wardens Brief). They have also found crack,\nheroin, and marijuana. Brief for City and County of San\nFrancisco et al. as Amici Curiae 9–11 (hereinafter San\nFrancisco Brief). The use of drugs can embolden inmates\n12   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nin aggression toward officers or each other; and, even\napart from their use, the trade in these substances can\nlead to violent confrontations. See PBA Brief 11.\n   There are many other kinds of contraband. The text-\nbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.\nSee Prisons: Today and Tomorrow 237 (J. Pollock ed.\n1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in viola-\ntion of prison rules. Contraband obviously includes drugs\nor weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even\nsome types of clothing”). Everyday items can undermine\nsecurity if introduced into a detention facility:\n     “Lighters and matches are fire and arson risks or po-\n     tential weapons. Cell phones are used to orchestrate\n     violence and criminality both within and without jail-\n     house walls. Pills and medications enhance suicide\n     risks. Chewing gum can block locking devices; hair-\n     pins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and\n     weapons.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 8–9.\nSomething as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a\nsignificant danger. Inmates commit more than 10,000\nassaults on correctional staff every year and many more\namong themselves. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice\nStatistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and\nFederal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003).\n   Contraband creates additional problems because scarce\nitems, including currency, have value in a jail’s culture\nand underground economy. Correctional officials inform\nus “[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence,\nextortion, and disorder.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 2.\nGangs exacerbate the problem. They “orchestrate thefts,\ncommit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take\nthe contraband from the weak.” Id., at 9–10. This puts\nthe entire facility, including detainees being held for a\nbrief term for a minor offense, at risk. Gangs do coerce\ninmates who have access to the outside world, such as\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Id., at 10; see, e.g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect\nHas Term to Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005,\np. B1 (“Weekend-only jail sentences are a common punish-\nment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).\nThese inmates, who might be thought to pose the least\nrisk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into\njail. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10. Concealing con-\ntraband often takes little time and effort. It might be done\nas an officer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief\ncommotion in a group holding cell. Something small\nmight be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear,\nbetween the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the\nmouth or some other body cavity.\n   It is not surprising that correctional officials have\nsought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease,\ngang affiliation, and contraband. Jails are often crowded,\nunsanitary, and dangerous places. There is a substantial\ninterest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own\nwill or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or\nwork at these institutions at even greater risk when he is\nadmitted to the general population.\n                             B\n  Petitioner acknowledges that correctional officials must\nbe allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake\nprocess and that this will require at least some detainees\nto lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position.\nThese procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are\ndesigned to uncover contraband that can go undetected by\na patdown, metal detector, and other less invasive\nsearches. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23\n(hereinafter United States Brief); New Jersey Wardens\nBrief 19, n. 6. Petitioner maintains there is little benefit\nto conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee\nwho has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any\n14   FLORENCE v.

In his view these de-\ntainees should be exempt from this process unless they\ngive officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding\ncontraband. It is reasonable, however, for correctional\nofficials to conclude this standard would be unworkable.\nThe record provides evidence that the seriousness of an\noffense is a poor predictor of who has contraband and\nthat it would be difficult in practice to determine whether\nindividual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.\n                             1\n  People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be\nthe most devious and dangerous criminals. Cf. Clements v.\nLogan, 454 U. S. 1304, 1305 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., in\nchambers) (deputy at a detention center shot by misde-\nmeanant who had not been strip searched). Hours after\nthe Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was\nstopped by a state trooper who noticed he was driving\nwithout a license plate. Johnston, Suspect Won’t Answer\nAny Questions, N. Y.

Reasonable\ncorrectional officials could conclude these uncertainties\nmean they must conduct the same thorough search of\neveryone who will be admitted to their facilities.\n  Experience shows that people arrested for minor of-\nfenses have tried to smuggle prohibited items into jail,\nsometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for the\nconcealment. They may have some of the same incentives\nas a serious criminal to hide contraband. A detainee\nmight risk carrying cash, cigarettes, or a penknife to\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Others may make a quick decision to hide\nunlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at\nthe time of their arrest. This record has concrete exam-\nples. Officers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility,\nfor example, discovered that a man arrested for driving\nunder the influence had “2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of\nrolling papers, 20 matches, and 5 sleeping pills” taped\nunder his scrotum. Brief for Atlantic County et al. as\nAmici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). A\nperson booked on a misdemeanor charge of disorderly\nconduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter,\ntobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his\nrectal cavity. See United States Brief 25, n. 15. San\nFrancisco officials have discovered contraband hidden in\nbody cavities of people arrested for trespassing, public\nnuisance, and shoplifting. San Francisco Brief 3. There\nhave been similar incidents at jails throughout the coun-\ntry. See United States Brief 25, n. 15.\n  Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not them-\nselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may\nbe coerced into doing so by others. See New Jersey War-\ndens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (“It is not unrea-\nsonable to assume, for instance, that low security risk\ndetainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or\nweapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact\nvisits”). This could happen any time detainees are held in\nthe same area, including in a van on the way to the station\nor in the holding cell of the jail. If, for example, a person\narrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is not\nsubject to the same search as others, this will be well\nknown to other detainees with jail experience. A hardened\ncriminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, ap-\nproach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of\na crime, a weapon, or some other contraband. As an ex-\npert in this case explained, “the interaction and mingling\nbetween misdemeanants and felons will only increase the\n16   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\namount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only\nconduct admission searches on felons.” App. 381a. Ex-\nempting people arrested for minor offenses from a stand-\nard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and\nresult in more contraband being brought into the deten-\ntion facility. This is a substantial reason not to mandate\nthe exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional\nlaw.\n                              2\n  It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify\ninmates by their current and prior offenses before the\nintake search. Jails can be even more dangerous than\nprisons because officials there know so little about the\npeople they admit at the outset. See New Jersey Wardens\nBrief 11–14. An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie\nabout his identity. The officers who conduct an initial\nsearch often do not have access to criminal history records.\nSee, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13. And\nthose records can be inaccurate or incomplete. See De-\npartment of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989). Petitioner’s rap sheet is\nan example. It did not reflect his previous arrest for pos-\nsession of a deadly weapon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19. In\nthe absence of reliable information it would be illogical to\nrequire officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do\nnot pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.\n  The laborious administration of prisons would become\nless effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were\nthe practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested\nby petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.\nEven if they had accurate information about a detainee’s\ncurrent and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s pro-\nposed regime, would encounter serious implementation\ndifficulties. They would be required, in a few minutes, to\ndetermine whether any of the underlying offenses were\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Other possible classifications based on charac-\nteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be\nunworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory\napplication. Most officers would not be well equipped to\nmake any of these legal determinations during the pres-\nsures of the intake process. Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985–987\n(Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin,\n466 U. S. 740, 761–762 (1984) (White, J., dissenting)\n(“[T]he Court’s approach will necessitate a case-by-case\nevaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a dif-\nficult task for which officers and courts are poorly\nequipped”). To avoid liability, officers might be inclined\nnot to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus\ncreating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.\nCf. Atwater, 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22.\n   The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater.\nThe petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment\nprohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of\nthe suspected crime “could not ultimately carry any jail\ntime” and there was “no compelling need for immediate\ndetention.” Id., at 346. That rule “promise[d] very little in\nthe way of administrability.” Id., at 350. Officers could\nnot be expected to draw the proposed lines on a moment’s\nnotice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would\nhave discouraged them from arresting criminals in any\nquestionable circumstances. Id., at 350–351 (“An officer\nnot quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail\ntime or not quite certain about a suspect’s risk of flight\nwould not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn\nout that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and\nthe defendant was long gone on the day of trial”). The\nFourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater.\nThe Court held that officers who have probable cause to\nbelieve even a minor criminal offense has been committed\nin their presence may arrest the offender. See id., at 354.\n18   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of Kthe Court \n\n                    Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nIndividual jurisdictions can of course choose “to impose\nmore restrictive safeguards through statutes limiting\nwarrantless arrests for minor offenders.” Id., at 352.\n   One of the central principles in Atwater applies with\nequal force here. Officers who interact with those sus-\npected of violating the law have an “essential interest in\nreadily administrable rules.” Id., at 347; accord, New York\nv. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981). The officials in charge\nof the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any compli-\ncated constitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less\nthorough inspections of some detainees based on their\nbehavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other\nfactors. They offer significant reasons why the Constitu-\ntion must not prevent them from conducting the same\nsearch on any suspected offender who will be admitted to\nthe general population in their facilities. The restrictions\nsuggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the\nprivacy of some detainees but at the risk of increased\ndanger to everyone in the facility, including the less seri-\nous offenders themselves.\n                             IV\n  This case does not require the Court to rule on the types\nof searches that would be reasonable in instances where,\nfor example, a detainee will be held without assignment to\nthe general jail population and without substantial contact\nwith other detainees. This describes the circumstances in\nAtwater. See 532 U. S., at 324 (“Officers took Atwater’s\n‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one\nhour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and\nreleased on $310 bond”). The accommodations provided in\nthese situations may diminish the need to conduct some\naspects of the searches at issue. Cf. United States Brief 30\n(discussing the segregation, and less invasive searches, of\nindividuals held by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for\nmisdemeanors or civil contempt).

S., at 528\n(“[I]ntentional harassment of even the most hardened\ncriminals cannot be tolerated by a civilized society”); Bell,\n441 U. S., at 560. There also may be legitimate concerns\nabout the invasiveness of searches that involve the touch-\ning of detainees.

As with JUSTICE ALITO,\nhowever, it is important for me that the Court does not\nforeclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it an-\nnounces.

Those circumstances\ninclude the facts that Florence was detained not for a\nminor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for\nhis arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if\nFlorence were to be detained, to holding him in the gen-\neral jail population.\n  Factual nuances have not played a significant role as\nthis case has been presented to the Court. Both courts\nbelow regarded acknowledged factual disputes as “imma-\nterial” to their conflicting dispositions, 621 F. 3d 296, 300\n(CA3 2010), and before this Court Florence challenged\nsuspicionless strip searches “no matter what the circum-\nstances.” Pet. for Cert. i.\n  The Court makes a persuasive case for the general\napplicability of the rule it announces.

The Court holds that jail adminis-\ntrators may require all arrestees who are committed to\nthe general population of a jail to undergo visual strip\nsearches not involving physical contact by corrections\nofficers. To perform the searches, officers may direct the\narrestees to disrobe, shower, and submit to a visual in-\nspection. As part of the inspection, the arrestees may be\nrequired to manipulate their bodies.\n   Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliat-\ning and deeply offensive to many, but there are reason-\nable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are\nadmitted to the general population of a jail. As the Court\nexplains, there is a serious danger that some detainees\nwill attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contra-\nband into the jail. Some detainees may have lice, which\ncan easily spread to others in the facility, and some de-\ntainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail\nis required to provide medical treatment. In addition, if a\ndetainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed\nwith detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue.\n   Petitioner and the dissent would permit corrections\nofficers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here\n2     FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                 COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nonly if the officers have a reasonable basis for thinking\nthat a particular arrestee may present a danger to other\ndetainees or members of the jail staff. But as the Court\nexplains, corrections officers are often in a very poor posi-\ntion to make such a determination, and the threat to the\nhealth and safety of detainees and staff, should the offic-\ners miscalculate, is simply too great.\n   It is important to note, however, that the Court does not\nhold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip\nsearch of an arrestee whose detention has not been re-\nviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in avail-\nable facilities apart from the general population. Most of\nthose arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and\nmost are released from custody prior to or at the time of\ntheir initial appearance before a magistrate. In some\ncases, the charges are dropped. In others, arrestees are\nreleased either on their own recognizance or on minimal\nbail. In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration. For\nthese persons, admission to the general jail population,\nwith the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may\nnot be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure\nis feasible. For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) and possibly even some local jails appear to segre-\ngate temporary detainees who are minor offenders from\nthe general population. See, e.g., Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 30; Bull v.

Similarly, as described by the Court of Appeals in\nBull, 595 F. 3d 964, the San Francisco County jail system distinguishes\nbetween arrestees who are eligible for release because, for instance,\nthey can post bail within 12 hours and those who must be housed for an\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

This question\nis phrased more broadly than what is at issue. The\ncase is limited to strip searches of those arrestees\nentering a jail’s general population, see 621 F. 3d 296,\n298 (CA3 2010). And the kind of strip search in ques-\ntion involves more than undressing and taking a\nshower (even if guards monitor the shower area for\nthreatened disorder). Rather, the searches here in-\nvolve close observation of the private areas of a per-\nson’s body and for that reason constitute a far more\nserious invasion of that person’s privacy.\n  The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue\nhere is not unique. A similar practice is well described\nin Dodge v.

For females, the procedures are similar ex-\n    cept females must in addition, squat to expose the\n    vagina.’ ” Id., at 46.\nBecause the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical\ninformation about the need for such a search in respect\nto minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in\nthis case do not differ significantly, I shall use the succinct\nDodge description as a template for the kind of strip\nsearch to which the Question Presented refers. See, e.g.,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 3a–4a (alleging that officers in-\nspected his genitals from an arm’s length away, required\nhim to lift his genitals, and examined his anal cavity).\n  In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a\nminor offense that does not involve drugs or violence—say\na traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil\nmatter, or any other such misdemeanor—is an “unreason-\nable searc[h]” forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless\nprison authorities have reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat the individual possesses drugs or other contraband.\nAnd I dissent from the Court’s contrary determination.\n                             I\n   Those confined in prison retain basic constitutional\nrights. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner\nv. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not\nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protec-\ntions of the Constitution”). The constitutional right at\nissue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of\n“unreasonable searches and seizures.” And, as the Court\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnotes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment\nbalancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates in\nBell v. Wolfish, supra. The Court said:\n    “The test of reasonableness under the Fourth\n    Amendment is not capable of precise definition or me-\n    chanical application. In each case it requires a bal-\n    ancing of the need for the particular search against\n    the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\n    Courts must consider the scope of the particular in-\n    trusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justi-\n    fication for initiating it, and the place in which it is\n    conducted.” Id., at 559.\nI have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the\nplace, scope and manner of “the particular intrusion.”\nBell, 441 U. S., at 559. I now explain why I believe that\nthe “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and\nlacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the cate-\ngory of minor offenders at issue.\n                             II\n   A strip search that involves a stranger peering without\nconsent at a naked individual, and in particular at the\nmost private portions of that person’s body, is a serious in-\nvasion of privacy. We have recently said, in respect to a\nschoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “mean-\ning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may\nreasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category\nof its own demanding its own specific suspicions.” Safford\nUnified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 11). The Courts of Appeals have more\ndirectly described the privacy interests at stake, writing,\nfor example, that practices similar to those at issue here\nare “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,\nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, [and] repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submission.” Mary Beth G. v.\n4    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nChicago, 723 F. 2d 1263, 1272 (CA7 1984) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted); see also, e.g., Blackburn v. Snow, 771\nF. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“ ‘[A]ll courts’ ” have recognized\nthe “ ‘ severe if not gross interference with a person’s pri-\nvacy’ ” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting\nArruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))). These\nkinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in\nBell, supra, at 558 (guards strip searched prisoners after\nthey received outside visits). Even when carried out in a\nrespectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,\nsee ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful,\nhumiliating, and degrading. And the harm to privacy\ninterests would seem particularly acute where the person\nsearched may well have no expectation of being subject\nto such a search, say, because she had simply received a\ntraffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he\nhad not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had\nbeen arrested for a minor trespass.\n   In Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001),\nfor example, police arrested a mother driving with her two\nchildren because their seat belts were not buckled. This\nCourt held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest\nfor a minor seatbelt offense. Id., at 323. But, in doing so,\nit pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour\n(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond)\nand that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jew-\nelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not\n“ ‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical inter-\nests.’ ” Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517\nU. S. 806, 818 (1996)). Would this Court have upheld the\narrest had the magistrate not been immediately available,\nhad the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had\nthey subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?\nCf. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56\n(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).\n   The petitioner, Albert W.

They include a\nnun, a Sister of Divine Providence for 50 years, who was ar-\nrested for trespassing during an antiwar demonstration.\nBrief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al. as Amici Curiae 6.\nThey include women who were strip-searched during\nperiods of lactation or menstruation. Id., at 11–12 (de-\nscribing humiliating experience of female student who was\nstrip searched while menstruating); Archuleta v.

They include individuals\ndetained for such infractions as driving with a noisy muf-\nfler, driving with an inoperable headlight, failing to use a\nturn signal, or riding a bicycle without an audible bell.\nBrief for Petitioner 11, 25; see also Mary Beth G., supra, at\n1267, n. 2 (considering strip search of a person arrested for\nhaving outstanding parking tickets and a person arrested\nfor making an improper left turn); Jones v.

See ante, at 2 (ALITO, J. concurring) (“admission to\ngeneral jail population, with the concomitant humiliation\nof a strip search, may not be reasonable” for those “whose\ndetention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and\nwho could not be held in available facilities apart from the\n6    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ngeneral population”).\n  I need not go on. I doubt that we seriously disagree\nabout the nature of the strip search or about the serious\naffront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it\npresents. The basic question before us is whether such\na search is nonetheless justified when an individual ar-\nrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the\ngeneral jail or prison population.\n                              III\n    The majority, like the respondents, argues that strip\nsearches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such\nas lice, that might spread in confinement, (2) to identify\ngang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special hous-\ning to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, includ-\ning drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum,\nwhich might prove harmful or dangerous in prison. In\nevaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize:\nthat managing a jail or prison is an “inordinately difficult\nundertaking,” Turner, 482 U. S., at 85; that prison regula-\ntions that interfere with important constitutional interests\nare generally valid as long as they are “reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests,” id., at 89; that finding\ninjuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing\nthe threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are\n“legitimate penological interests,” ibid.; and that we nor-\nmally defer to the expertise of jail and prison administra-\ntors in such matters, id., at 85.\n    Nonetheless, the “particular” invasion of interests, Bell,\n441 U. S., at 559, must be “ ‘reasonably related’ ” to the jus-\ntifying “penological interest” and the need must not be\n“ ‘exaggerated.’ ” Turner, supra, at 87. It is at this point\nthat I must part company with the majority. I have found\nno convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of\nreasonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those\narrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to fur-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nther the penal interests mentioned. And there are strong\nreasons to believe they are not justified.\n  The lack of justification is fairly obvious with respect to\nthe first two penological interests advanced. The searches\nalready employed at Essex and Burlington include: (a)\npat-frisking all inmates; (b) making inmates go through\nmetal detectors (including the Body Orifice Screening\nSystem (BOSS) chair used at Essex County Correctional\nFacility that identifies metal hidden within the body); (c)\nmaking inmates shower and use particular delousing\nagents or bathing supplies; and (d) searching inmates’\nclothing. In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees\ncould be lawfully subject to being viewed in their under-\ngarments by jail officers or during showering (for security\npurposes). Brief for Petitioner 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7–8\n(“Showering in the presence of officers is not something\nthat requires reasonable suspicion”). No one here has\noffered any reason, example, or empirical evidence sug-\ngesting the inadequacy of such practices for detecting\ninjuries, diseases, or tattoos. In particular, there is no\nconnection between the genital lift and the “squat and\ncough” that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health\nor gang concerns. See Brief for Academics on Gang Be-\nhavior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New\nJersey et al. as Amici Curiae.\n  The lack of justification for such a strip search is less\nobvious but no less real in respect to the third interest,\nnamely that of detecting contraband. The information\ndemonstrating the lack of justification is of three kinds.\nFirst, there are empirically based conclusions reached in\nspecific cases. The New York Federal District Court, to\nwhich I have referred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons\nadmitted to the Orange County correctional facility be-\ntween 1999 and 2003. Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69.\nThese 23,000 persons underwent a strip search of the kind\ndescribed, supra, at 1. Of these 23,000 persons, the court\n8    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nwrote, “the County encountered three incidents of drugs\nrecovered from an inmate’s anal cavity and two incidents\nof drugs falling from an inmate’s underwear during the\ncourse of a strip search.” 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69. The\ncourt added that in four of these five instances there may\nhave been “reasonable suspicion” to search, leaving only\none instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy\n“arguably” detected additional contraband. Id., at 70. The\nstudy is imperfect, for search standards changed during\nthe time it was conducted. Id., at 50–51. But the large\nnumber of inmates, the small number of “incidents,” and\nthe District Court’s own conclusions make the study pro-\nbative though not conclusive.\n   Similarly, in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2\n2001), the court received data produced by the county\njail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip\nsearches, similar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new\ninmates over a period of five years. Brief for Plaintiff-\nAppellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00–7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16\n(citing to its App. 343a–493a). In 16 instances the\nsearches led to the discovery of contraband. The record\nfurther showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband\nwould have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes\nand outer-clothing. In the three instances in which contra-\nband was found on the detainee’s body or in a body cavity,\nthere was a drug or felony history that would have justi-\nfied a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion.\nIbid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as\nAmicus Curiae 10.\n   Second, there is the plethora of recommendations of\nprofessional bodies, such as correctional associations, that\nhave studied and thoughtfully considered the matter. The\nAmerican Correctional Association (ACA)—an association\nthat informs our view of “what is obtainable and what is\nacceptable in corrections philosophy,” Brown v. Plata, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 43)—has promulgated a\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

See Dept. of Justice, BOP\nProgram Statement 5140.38, p. 5. (2004), http://www.\nbop.gov/policy/progstat/5140_038.pdf.\n   Third, there is general experience in areas where the\nlaw has forbidden here-relevant suspicionless searches.\nLaws in at least 10 States prohibit suspicionless strip\nsearches. See, e.g., Mo. Stat. Ann. §544.193.2 (2002) (“No\nperson arrested or detained for a traffic offense or an\noffense which does not constitute a felony may be subject\nto a strip search or a body cavity search . . . unless there is\nprobable cause to believe that such person is concealing a\nweapon . . . or contraband”); Kan.

Code §10.79.130(1) (2010) (similar).\n   At the same time at least seven Courts of Appeals have\nconsidered the question and have required reasonable\nsuspicion that an arrestee is concealing weapons or con-\ntraband before a strip search of one arrested for a minor\noffense can take place.

Respondents\nhave not presented convincing grounds to believe that\nadministration of these legal standards has increased the\nsmuggling of contraband into prison.\n   Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set\nforth any clear example of an instance in which contra-\nband was smuggled into the general jail population during\nintake that could not have been discovered if the jail was\nemploying a reasonable suspicion standard. The majority\ndoes cite general examples from Atlantic County and\nWashington State where contraband has been recovered\nin correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving\nunder the influence and disorderly conduct. Ante, at 15.\nSimilarly, the majority refers to information, provided by\nSan Francisco jail authorities, stating that they have\nfound handcuff keys, syringes, crack pipes, drugs, and\nknives during body-cavity searches, including during\nsearches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for\nillegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prosti-\ntution and public nuisance (“bindles of crack cocaine”).\nBrief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici\nCuriae 7–13; Bull, supra, at 969; ante, at 15. And associ-\nated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual\ncavity searches of all those admitted to the general popu-\nlation in San Francisco may account for the discovery of\ncontraband in approximately 15 instances per year. Bull,\nsupra, at 969.\n   But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us\nwhether reasonable suspicion was present or absent in any\nof the 15 instances. Nor is there any showing by the\nmajority that the few unclear examples of contraband\nrecovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or any-\nwhere else could not have been discovered through a policy\n12   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat required reasonable suspicion for strip searches. And\nwithout some such indication, I am left without an exam-\nple of any instance in which contraband was found on an\nindividual through an inspection of their private parts or\nbody cavities which could not have been found under a\npolicy requiring reasonable suspicion. Hence, at a mini-\nmum these examples, including San Francisco’s statistics,\ndo not provide a significant counterweight to those pre-\nsented in Dodge and Shain.\n   Nor do I find the majority’s lack of examples surprising.\nAfter all, those arrested for minor offenses are often\nstopped and arrested unexpectedly. And they conse-\nquently will have had little opportunity to hide things in\ntheir body cavities. Thus, the widespread advocacy by\nprison experts and the widespread application in many\nStates and federal circuits of “reasonable suspicion” re-\nquirements indicates an ability to apply such standards in\npractice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal\ninterest in preventing the smuggling of contraband.\n   The majority is left with the word of prison officials in\nsupport of its contrary proposition. And though that word\nis important, it cannot be sufficient. Cf. Dept. of Justice,\nNational Institute of Corrections, W. Collins, Jails and the\nConstitution: An Overview 28–29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though\nprison officials often “passionately believed” similar re-\nquirements would lead to contraband-related security\nproblems, once those requirements were imposed those\n“problems did not develop”).\n   The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S. 520, itself.\nAnte, at 5–6. In that case, the Court considered a prison\npolicy requiring a strip search of all detainees after “con-\ntact visits” with unimprisoned visitors. 441 U. S., at 558.\nThe Court found that policy justified. Id., at 560. Con-\ntrary to the majority’s suggestion, that case does not pro-\nvide precedent for the proposition that the word of prison\nofficials (accompanied by a “single instance” of empirical\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nexample) is sufficient to support a strip search policy.\nAnte, at 6. The majority correctly points out that there\nwas but “one instance” in which the policy had led to the\ndiscovery of an effort to smuggle contraband. Bell, 441\nU. S., at 558. But the Court understood that the prison\nhad been open only four months. Id., at 526. And the\nCourt was also presented with other examples where\ninmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact\nvisits. Id., at 559.\n   It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison jus-\ntified in conducting postcontact searches even as to pre-\ntrial detainees who had been brought before a magistrate,\ndenied bail, and “committed to the detention facility only\nbecause no other less drastic means [could] reasonably\nassure [their] presence at trial.” 441 U. S., at 546, n. 28.\nThe Court recognized that those ordered detained by a\nmagistrate were often those “charged with serious crimes,\nor who have prior records.” Ibid. For that reason, those\ndetainees posed at least the same security risk as con-\nvicted inmates, if not “a greater risk to jail security and\norder,” and a “greater risk of escape.” Ibid. And, of\ncourse, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors\nhad the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case,\nunlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after\nan unexpected arrest).\n   The Bell Court had no occasion to focus upon those\narrested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial officer’s de-\ntermination that they should be committed to prison. I\nshare JUSTICE ALITO’s intuition that the calculus may be\ndifferent in such cases, given that “[m]ost of those arrested\nfor minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are re-\nleased from custody prior to or at the time of their initial\nappearance before a magistrate.” Ante, at 2 (concurring\nopinion). As he notes, this case does not address, and\n“reserves judgment on,” whether it is always reasonable\n“to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee’s detention\n14   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhas been reviewed by a judicial officer.” Ante, at 3. In my\nview, it is highly questionable that officials would be\njustified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world\nof the general jail population and subjecting to a strip\nsearch someone with no criminal background arrested for\njaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.\nIndeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Fed-\neral Government and many States segregate such individ-\nuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions\nprovide that such individuals be released without deten-\ntion in the ordinary case. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§853.6 (West Supp. 2012).\n   In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for\nthe Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to\nadmit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail\npopulation, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip\nsearch,” prior to any review by a judicial officer. Ante, at 2\n(ALITO, J., concurring).\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for\nthe strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would\nsubject those arrested for minor offenses to serious inva-\nsions of their personal privacy.

Argued October 12, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012\nPetitioner was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Jersey state\n  trooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a\n  bench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest after he failed to appear\n  at a hearing to enforce a fine. He was initially detained in the Bur-\n  lington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Cor-\n  rectional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the\n  fine had been paid. At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming\n  detainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for\n  scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed. Petition-\n  er claims that he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out\n  his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals. At the second jail, peti-\n  tioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while\n  an officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an\n  officer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arm-\n  pits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his\n  clothes examined. Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift\n  his genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting. He filed a 42\n  U. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the gov-\n  ernment entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging\n  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that per-\n  sons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive\n  searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of\n  weapons, drugs, or other contraband. The court granted him sum-\n  mary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” nonindictable offenders\n  without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment. The\n  Third Circuit reversed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2     FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                 COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n621 F. 3d 296, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails\n  struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of\n  the institutions, and thus the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n  do not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro-\n  poses. Pp. 5−18, 19.\n     (a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers requires the\n  expertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discre-\n  tion to devise reasonable solutions to problems. A regulation imping-\n  ing on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is rea-\n  sonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley,\n  482 U. S. 78, 89. This Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558,\n  upheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional fa-\n  cilities “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of\n  a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from\n  outside the institution[s],” deferring to the judgment of correctional\n  officials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to\n  deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.\n  In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586−587, the Court upheld a\n  general ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling\n  threat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions\n  for certain detainees. The Court, in Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,\n  522−523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband\n  depends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable\n  exceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of\n  inmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is\n  concealing a prohibited item. These cases establish that correctional\n  officials must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to de-\n  tect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and\n  that “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\n  that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considera-\n  tions courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\n  matters,” Block, supra, at 584–585.\n     Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to\n  be processed at jails. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354.\n  Pp. 5−9.\n     (b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives\n  involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detain-\n  ees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue ab-\n  sent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.\n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in conducting a thor-\n  ough search as a standard part of the intake process. The admission\n  of new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee popula-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntion, and the new detainees themselves. Officials therefore must\nscreen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring\nimmediate medical attention. It may be difficult to identify and treat\nmedical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual in-\nspection. Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving\nthem reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for\nsigns of gang affiliation as part of the intake process. Additionally,\ncorrectional officials have to detect weapons, drugs, alcohol, and\nother prohibited items new detainees may possess. Drugs can make\ninmates aggressive toward officers or each other, and drug trading\ncan lead to violent confrontations. Contraband has value in a jail’s\nculture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods\ncan lead to violence, extortion, and disorder. Pp. 9−13.\n   (c) Petitioner’s proposal―that new detainees not arrested for seri-\nous crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from\ninvasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to sus-\npect them of hiding contraband―is unworkable. The seriousness of\nan offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be\ndifficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the\nproposed exemption. Even persons arrested for a minor offense may\nbe coerced by others into concealing contraband. Exempting people\narrested for minor offenses from a standard search protocol thus may\nput them at greater risk and result in more contraband being\nbrought into the detention facility.\n   It also may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and pri-\nor offenses before the intake search. Jail officials know little at the\noutset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about\nhis identity. The officers conducting an initial search often do not\nhave access to criminal history records. And those records can be in-\naccurate or incomplete. Even with accurate information, officers\nwould encounter serious implementation difficulties. They would be\nrequired to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were\nserious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol. Other\npossible classifications based on characteristics of individual detain-\nees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of\ndiscriminatory application. To avoid liability, officers might be in-\nclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creat-\ning unnecessary risk for the entire jail population. While the re-\nstrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy\nof some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to eve-\nryone in the facility, including the less serious offenders. The Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed\nframework. Pp. 13−18, 19.\n4     FLORENCE v.

Facility personnel, other inmates, and the\nnew detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these\nthreats are introduced into the jail population. This case\npresents the question of what rules, or limitations, the\nConstitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who\nare to be held in jail while their cases are being processed.\nThe term “jail” is used here in a broad sense to include\nprisons and other detention facilities.         The specific\nmeasures being challenged will be described in more\ndetail; but, in broad terms, the controversy concerns\nwhether every detainee who will be admitted to the gen-\neral population may be required to undergo a close visual\ninspection while undressed.\n  The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court\n——————\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV of this opinion.\n2    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhas sufficient expertise and information in the record to\nmandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions\nand limitations sought by those who challenge the visual\nsearch procedures at issue. In addressing this type of\nconstitutional claim courts must defer to the judgment of\ncorrectional officials unless the record contains substantial\nevidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or un-\njustified response to problems of jail security. That\nnecessary showing has not been made in this case.\n                              I\n   In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, peti-\ntioner Albert Florence was arrested after fleeing from\npolice officers in Essex County, New Jersey. He was\ncharged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly\nweapon. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser\noffenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly in-\nstallments. In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments\nand failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench\nwarrant was issued for his arrest. He paid the outstand-\ning balance less than a week later; but, for some unex-\nplained reason, the warrant remained in a statewide\ncomputer database.\n   Two years later, in Burlington County, New Jersey,\npetitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile\nby a state trooper. Based on the outstanding warrant in\nthe computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and\ntook him to the Burlington County Detention Center. He\nwas held there for six days and then was transferred to\nthe Essex County Correctional Facility. It is not the ar-\nrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that\ngives rise to the claims before the Court.\n   Burlington County jail procedures required every ar-\nrestee to shower with a delousing agent. Officers would\ncheck arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contra-\nband as they disrobed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner claims he was also instructed to open his\nmouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and\nlift his genitals. (It is not clear whether this last step was\npart of the normal practice. See ibid.) Petitioner shared a\ncell with at least one other person and interacted with\nother inmates following his admission to the jail. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17.\n   The Essex County Correctional Facility, where peti-\ntioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail\nin New Jersey. App. 70a. It admits more than 25,000 in-\nmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at\nany given time. When petitioner was transferred there,\nall arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and\nwaited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.\nWhen they left the holding cell, they were instructed to\nremove their clothing while an officer looked for body\nmarkings, wounds, and contraband. Apparently without\ntouching the detainees, an officer looked at their ears,\nnose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits,\nand other body openings. Id., at 57a–59a; App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 137a–144a. This policy applied regardless of the\ncircumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the\ndetainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history. Peti-\ntioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn\naround, and cough in a squatting position as part of the\nprocess. After a mandatory shower, during which his\nclothes were inspected, petitioner was admitted to the\nfacility. App. 3a–4a, 52a, 258a. He was released the next\nday, when the charges against him were dismissed.\n   Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated\nthe jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants.\nThe suit was commenced in the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey. Seeking relief under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 for violations of his Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that per-\nsons arrested for a minor offense could not be required\n4    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto remove their clothing and expose the most private areas\nof their bodies to close visual inspection as a routine part\nof the intake process. Rather, he contended, officials could\nconduct this kind of search only if they had reason to\nsuspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs,\nor other contraband. The District Court certified a class of\nindividuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense\nunder New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington\nCounty or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked\neven though an officer had not articulated any reasonable\nsuspicion they were concealing contraband.\n   After discovery, the court granted petitioner’s motion\nfor summary judgment on the unlawful search claim. It\nconcluded that any policy of “strip searching” nonindict-\nable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the\nFourth Amendment. A divided panel of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding\nthat the procedures described by the District Court struck\na reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the\nsecurity needs of the two jails. 621 F. 3d 296 (2010). The\ncase proceeds on the understanding that the officers\nsearched detainees prior to their admission to the general\npopulation, as the Court of Appeals seems to have as-\nsumed. See id., at 298, 311. Petitioner has not argued\nthis factual premise is incorrect.\n   The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on file,\nand some cases of this Court refer to a “strip search.” The\nterm is imprecise. It may refer simply to the instruction\nto remove clothing while an officer observes from a dis-\ntance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual in-\nspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it\nmay include directing detainees to shake their heads or to\nrun their hands through their hair to dislodge what might\nbe hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise\narms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the\nears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

In the instant case, the\nterm does not include any touching of unclothed areas\nby the inspecting officer. There are no allegations that\nthe detainees here were touched in any way as part of the\nsearches.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing\nconclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires\ncorrectional officials to exempt some detainees who will be\nadmitted to a jail’s general population from the searches\nhere at issue. This Court granted certiorari to address the\nquestion. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The difficulties of operating a detention center must not\nbe underestimated by the courts. Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 84–85 (1987). Jails (in the stricter sense of\nthe term, excluding prison facilities) admit more than 13\nmillion inmates a year. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear\n2010—Statistical Tables 2 (2011). The largest facilities\nprocess hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be\ncrowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation,\nor because of detainees arriving from other jurisdictions.\nMaintaining safety and order at these institutions re-\nquires the expertise of correctional officials, who must\nhave substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions\nto the problems they face. The Court has confirmed the\nimportance of deference to correctional officials and ex-\nplained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s consti-\ntutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests.” Turner, supra, at 89;\nsee Overton v.

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nframework applies to Fourth Amendment challenges.\nThat case addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees\nin any correctional facility run by the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection\nas a part of a strip search conducted after every contact\nvisit with a person from outside the institution.” Id., at\n558. Inmates at the federal Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter in New York City argued there was no security\njustification for these searches. Officers searched guests\nbefore they entered the visiting room, and the inmates\nwere under constant surveillance during the visit. Id., at\n577–578 (Marshall, J., dissenting). There had been but\none instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak con-\ntraband back into the facility. See id., at 559 (majority\nopinion). The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy.\nIt deferred to the judgment of correctional officials that\nthe inspections served not only to discover but also to\ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohib-\nited items inside. Id., at 558. The Court explained that\nthere is no mechanical way to determine whether intru-\nsions on an inmate’s privacy are reasonable. Id., at 559.\nThe need for a particular search must be balanced against\nthe resulting invasion of personal rights. Ibid.\n   Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and\nprisons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell. In\nBlock v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the\nCourt concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could\nban all contact visits because of the threat they posed:\n    “They open the institution to the introduction of\n    drugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can\n    easily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contra-\n    band in countless ways and pass them to an inmate\n    unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers. And\n    these items can readily be slipped from the clothing of\n    an innocent child, or transferred by other visitors\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    permitted close contact with inmates.” Id., at 586.\nThere were “many justifications” for imposing a general\nban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain\ndetainees. Id., at 587. Among other problems, it would be\n“a difficult if not impossible task” to identify “inmates who\nhave propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.”\nIbid. This was made “even more difficult by the brevity of\ndetention and the constantly changing nature of the in-\nmate population.” Ibid.\n   The Court has also recognized that deterring the posses-\nsion of contraband depends in part on the ability to con-\nduct searches without predictable exceptions. In Hudson\nv. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question\nof whether prison officials could perform random searches\nof inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect\na particular individual of concealing a prohibited item.\nId., at 522–523. The Court upheld the constitutionality of\nthe practice, recognizing that “ ‘[f]or one to advocate that\nprison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an\nenunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at\na particular inmate is to ignore the realities of prison\noperation.’ ” Id., at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Common-\nwealth, 222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)).\nInmates would adapt to any pattern or loopholes they\ndiscovered in the search protocol and then undermine the\nsecurity of the institution. 468 U. S., at 529.\n   These cases establish that correctional officials must be\npermitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect\nand deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.\nSee Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (“[M]aintaining institutional\nsecurity and preserving internal order and discipline are\nessential goals that may require limitation or retraction of\nretained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners\nand pretrial detainees”). The task of determining whether\na policy is reasonably related to legitimate security inter-\n8    FLORENCE v.

This Court\nhas repeated the admonition that, “ ‘in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the\nofficials have exaggerated their response to these consid-\nerations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert\njudgment in such matters.’ ” Block, supra, at 584–585;\nBell, supra, at 548.\n   In many jails officials seek to improve security by re-\nquiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be\ndetained. These procedures have been used in different\nplaces throughout the country, from Cranston, Rhode\nIsland, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho. See\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F. 3d 107, 108–109 (CA1\n2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F. 2d 393, 394 (CA10\n1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984)\n(per curiam); see also, e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San\nFrancisco, 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Fran-\ncisco, California); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11\n2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v. Crouch, 872\nF. 2d 1248, 1251 (CA6 1989) (Jefferson Cty., Ky.); Weber v.\nDell, 804 F. 2d 796, 797–798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty.,\nN. Y.); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5\n1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.).\n   Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the\ndetainees processed at these facilities. This is, in part, a\nconsequence of the exercise of state authority that was the\nsubject of Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).\nAtwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental ques-\ntion of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in\nthe first place. The case involved a woman who was ar-\nrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her\nchildren were wearing their seatbelts. The arrestee ar-\ngued the Fourth Amendment prohibited her custodial\narrest without a warrant when an offense could not result\nin jail time and there was no compelling need for immedi-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

The Court held that a Fourth\nAmendment restriction on this power would put officers in\nan “almost impossible spot.” Id., at 350. Their ability to\narrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the pre-\ncise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat\noffender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling\nneed to detain someone. Id., at 348–349. The Court re-\njected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred\ncustodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of\nconstitutional law. It ruled, based on established princi-\nples, that officers may make an arrest based upon proba-\nble cause to believe the person has committed a criminal\noffense in their presence. See id., at 354. The Court\nstated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is\nnot well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-by-\ncase determinations of government need, lest every discre-\ntionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion\nfor constitutional review.” Id., at 347.\n   Atwater did not address whether the Constitution im-\nposes special restrictions on the searches of offenders\nsuspected of committing minor offenses once they are\ntaken to jail. Some Federal Courts of Appeals have held\nthat corrections officials may not conduct a strip search of\nthese detainees, even if no touching is involved, absent\nreasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. 621 F. 3d,\nat 303–304, and n. 4. The Courts of Appeals to address\nthis issue in the last decade, however, have come to the\nopposite conclusion. See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame\nv. Dillard, 637 F. 3d 380 (CADC 2011); Powell, supra;\nBull, supra. The current case is set against this precedent\nand governed by the principles announced in Turner and\nBell.\n                            III\n  The question here is whether undoubted security im-\nperatives involved in jail supervision override the asser-\n10   FLORENCE v.

The\nCourt has held that deference must be given to the offi-\ncials in charge of the jail unless there is “substantial\nevidence” demonstrating their response to the situation is\nexaggerated. Block, 468 U. S., at 584–585 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Petitioner has not met this standard,\nand the record provides full justifications for the proce-\ndures used.\n                                A\n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in con-\nducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake\nprocess. The admission of inmates creates numerous risks\nfor facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and\nfor a new detainee himself or herself. The danger of intro-\nducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well\ndocumented. See, e.g., Deger & Quick, The Enduring\nMenace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention\nin a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174–\n175, 177–178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and\nPrisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007).\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons recommends that staff\nscreen new detainees for these conditions. See Clinical\nPractice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clini-\ncal Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011).\nPersons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries\nrequiring immediate medical attention. It may be difficult\nto identify and treat these problems until detainees re-\nmove their clothes for a visual inspection. See Prison and\nJail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P. Carlson\n& G. Garrett eds., 2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Carlson &\nGarrett).\n  Jails and prisons also face grave threats posed by the\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

The groups recruit new members by\nforce, engage in assaults against staff, and give other\ninmates a reason to arm themselves. Ibid. Fights among\nfeuding gangs can be deadly, and the officers who must\nmaintain order are put in harm’s way. PBA Brief 17.\nThese considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify\na visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of\ngang affiliation as part of the intake process. The identi-\nfication and isolation of gang members before they are\nadmitted protects everyone in the facility. Cf. Fraise v.\nTerhune, 283 F. 3d 506, 509–510 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.)\n(describing a statewide policy authorizing the identifica-\ntion and isolation of gang members in prison).\n   Detecting contraband concealed by new detainees, fur-\nthermore, is a most serious responsibility. Weapons,\ndrugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a jail.\nCf. Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528 (recognizing “the constant\nfight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit\ndrugs, and other contraband”). Correctional officers have\nhad to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor\nblades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their\nperson, including in their body cavities. See Bull, 595\nF. 3d, at 967, 969; Brief for New Jersey County Jail War-\ndens Association as Amicus Curiae 17–18 (hereinafter\nNew Jersey Wardens Brief). They have also found crack,\nheroin, and marijuana. Brief for City and County of San\nFrancisco et al. as Amici Curiae 9–11 (hereinafter San\nFrancisco Brief). The use of drugs can embolden inmates\n12   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nin aggression toward officers or each other; and, even\napart from their use, the trade in these substances can\nlead to violent confrontations. See PBA Brief 11.\n   There are many other kinds of contraband. The text-\nbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.\nSee Prisons: Today and Tomorrow 237 (J. Pollock ed.\n1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in viola-\ntion of prison rules. Contraband obviously includes drugs\nor weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even\nsome types of clothing”). Everyday items can undermine\nsecurity if introduced into a detention facility:\n     “Lighters and matches are fire and arson risks or po-\n     tential weapons. Cell phones are used to orchestrate\n     violence and criminality both within and without jail-\n     house walls. Pills and medications enhance suicide\n     risks. Chewing gum can block locking devices; hair-\n     pins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and\n     weapons.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 8–9.\nSomething as simple as an overlooked pen can pose a\nsignificant danger. Inmates commit more than 10,000\nassaults on correctional staff every year and many more\namong themselves. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice\nStatistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and\nFederal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003).\n   Contraband creates additional problems because scarce\nitems, including currency, have value in a jail’s culture\nand underground economy. Correctional officials inform\nus “[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence,\nextortion, and disorder.” New Jersey Wardens Brief 2.\nGangs exacerbate the problem. They “orchestrate thefts,\ncommit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take\nthe contraband from the weak.” Id., at 9–10. This puts\nthe entire facility, including detainees being held for a\nbrief term for a minor offense, at risk. Gangs do coerce\ninmates who have access to the outside world, such as\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npeople serving their time on the weekends, to sneak things\ninto the jail. Id., at 10; see, e.g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect\nHas Term to Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005,\np. B1 (“Weekend-only jail sentences are a common punish-\nment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).\nThese inmates, who might be thought to pose the least\nrisk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into\njail. See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10. Concealing con-\ntraband often takes little time and effort. It might be done\nas an officer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief\ncommotion in a group holding cell. Something small\nmight be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear,\nbetween the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the\nmouth or some other body cavity.\n   It is not surprising that correctional officials have\nsought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease,\ngang affiliation, and contraband. Jails are often crowded,\nunsanitary, and dangerous places. There is a substantial\ninterest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own\nwill or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or\nwork at these institutions at even greater risk when he is\nadmitted to the general population.\n                             B\n  Petitioner acknowledges that correctional officials must\nbe allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake\nprocess and that this will require at least some detainees\nto lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position.\nThese procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are\ndesigned to uncover contraband that can go undetected by\na patdown, metal detector, and other less invasive\nsearches. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23\n(hereinafter United States Brief); New Jersey Wardens\nBrief 19, n. 6. Petitioner maintains there is little benefit\nto conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee\nwho has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any\n14   FLORENCE v.

In his view these de-\ntainees should be exempt from this process unless they\ngive officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding\ncontraband. It is reasonable, however, for correctional\nofficials to conclude this standard would be unworkable.\nThe record provides evidence that the seriousness of an\noffense is a poor predictor of who has contraband and\nthat it would be difficult in practice to determine whether\nindividual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.\n                             1\n  People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be\nthe most devious and dangerous criminals. Cf. Clements v.\nLogan, 454 U. S. 1304, 1305 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., in\nchambers) (deputy at a detention center shot by misde-\nmeanant who had not been strip searched). Hours after\nthe Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was\nstopped by a state trooper who noticed he was driving\nwithout a license plate. Johnston, Suspect Won’t Answer\nAny Questions, N. Y.

Reasonable\ncorrectional officials could conclude these uncertainties\nmean they must conduct the same thorough search of\neveryone who will be admitted to their facilities.\n  Experience shows that people arrested for minor of-\nfenses have tried to smuggle prohibited items into jail,\nsometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for the\nconcealment. They may have some of the same incentives\nas a serious criminal to hide contraband. A detainee\nmight risk carrying cash, cigarettes, or a penknife to\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Others may make a quick decision to hide\nunlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at\nthe time of their arrest. This record has concrete exam-\nples. Officers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility,\nfor example, discovered that a man arrested for driving\nunder the influence had “2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of\nrolling papers, 20 matches, and 5 sleeping pills” taped\nunder his scrotum. Brief for Atlantic County et al. as\nAmici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). A\nperson booked on a misdemeanor charge of disorderly\nconduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter,\ntobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his\nrectal cavity. See United States Brief 25, n. 15. San\nFrancisco officials have discovered contraband hidden in\nbody cavities of people arrested for trespassing, public\nnuisance, and shoplifting. San Francisco Brief 3. There\nhave been similar incidents at jails throughout the coun-\ntry. See United States Brief 25, n. 15.\n  Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not them-\nselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may\nbe coerced into doing so by others. See New Jersey War-\ndens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (“It is not unrea-\nsonable to assume, for instance, that low security risk\ndetainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or\nweapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact\nvisits”). This could happen any time detainees are held in\nthe same area, including in a van on the way to the station\nor in the holding cell of the jail. If, for example, a person\narrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is not\nsubject to the same search as others, this will be well\nknown to other detainees with jail experience. A hardened\ncriminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, ap-\nproach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of\na crime, a weapon, or some other contraband. As an ex-\npert in this case explained, “the interaction and mingling\nbetween misdemeanants and felons will only increase the\n16   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\namount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only\nconduct admission searches on felons.” App. 381a. Ex-\nempting people arrested for minor offenses from a stand-\nard search protocol thus may put them at greater risk and\nresult in more contraband being brought into the deten-\ntion facility. This is a substantial reason not to mandate\nthe exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional\nlaw.\n                              2\n  It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify\ninmates by their current and prior offenses before the\nintake search. Jails can be even more dangerous than\nprisons because officials there know so little about the\npeople they admit at the outset. See New Jersey Wardens\nBrief 11–14. An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie\nabout his identity. The officers who conduct an initial\nsearch often do not have access to criminal history records.\nSee, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13. And\nthose records can be inaccurate or incomplete. See De-\npartment of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989). Petitioner’s rap sheet is\nan example. It did not reflect his previous arrest for pos-\nsession of a deadly weapon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19. In\nthe absence of reliable information it would be illogical to\nrequire officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do\nnot pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.\n  The laborious administration of prisons would become\nless effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were\nthe practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested\nby petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.\nEven if they had accurate information about a detainee’s\ncurrent and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s pro-\nposed regime, would encounter serious implementation\ndifficulties. They would be required, in a few minutes, to\ndetermine whether any of the underlying offenses were\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nserious enough to authorize the more invasive search\nprotocol. Other possible classifications based on charac-\nteristics of individual detainees also might prove to be\nunworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory\napplication. Most officers would not be well equipped to\nmake any of these legal determinations during the pres-\nsures of the intake process. Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985–987\n(Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin,\n466 U. S. 740, 761–762 (1984) (White, J., dissenting)\n(“[T]he Court’s approach will necessitate a case-by-case\nevaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a dif-\nficult task for which officers and courts are poorly\nequipped”). To avoid liability, officers might be inclined\nnot to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus\ncreating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.\nCf. Atwater, 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22.\n   The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater.\nThe petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment\nprohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of\nthe suspected crime “could not ultimately carry any jail\ntime” and there was “no compelling need for immediate\ndetention.” Id., at 346. That rule “promise[d] very little in\nthe way of administrability.” Id., at 350. Officers could\nnot be expected to draw the proposed lines on a moment’s\nnotice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would\nhave discouraged them from arresting criminals in any\nquestionable circumstances. Id., at 350–351 (“An officer\nnot quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail\ntime or not quite certain about a suspect’s risk of flight\nwould not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn\nout that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and\nthe defendant was long gone on the day of trial”). The\nFourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater.\nThe Court held that officers who have probable cause to\nbelieve even a minor criminal offense has been committed\nin their presence may arrest the offender. See id., at 354.\n18   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   Opinion of Kthe Court \n\n                    Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nIndividual jurisdictions can of course choose “to impose\nmore restrictive safeguards through statutes limiting\nwarrantless arrests for minor offenders.” Id., at 352.\n   One of the central principles in Atwater applies with\nequal force here. Officers who interact with those sus-\npected of violating the law have an “essential interest in\nreadily administrable rules.” Id., at 347; accord, New York\nv. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981). The officials in charge\nof the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any compli-\ncated constitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less\nthorough inspections of some detainees based on their\nbehavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other\nfactors. They offer significant reasons why the Constitu-\ntion must not prevent them from conducting the same\nsearch on any suspected offender who will be admitted to\nthe general population in their facilities. The restrictions\nsuggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the\nprivacy of some detainees but at the risk of increased\ndanger to everyone in the facility, including the less seri-\nous offenders themselves.\n                             IV\n  This case does not require the Court to rule on the types\nof searches that would be reasonable in instances where,\nfor example, a detainee will be held without assignment to\nthe general jail population and without substantial contact\nwith other detainees.

Those circumstances\ninclude the facts that Florence was detained not for a\nminor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for\nhis arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if\nFlorence were to be detained, to holding him in the gen-\neral jail population.\n  Factual nuances have not played a significant role as\nthis case has been presented to the Court. Both courts\nbelow regarded acknowledged factual disputes as “imma-\nterial” to their conflicting dispositions, 621 F. 3d 296, 300\n(CA3 2010), and before this Court Florence challenged\nsuspicionless strip searches “no matter what the circum-\nstances.” Pet. for Cert. i.\n  The Court makes a persuasive case for the general\napplicability of the rule it announces.

The Court holds that jail adminis-\ntrators may require all arrestees who are committed to\nthe general population of a jail to undergo visual strip\nsearches not involving physical contact by corrections\nofficers. To perform the searches, officers may direct the\narrestees to disrobe, shower, and submit to a visual in-\nspection. As part of the inspection, the arrestees may be\nrequired to manipulate their bodies.\n   Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliat-\ning and deeply offensive to many, but there are reason-\nable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are\nadmitted to the general population of a jail. As the Court\nexplains, there is a serious danger that some detainees\nwill attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contra-\nband into the jail. Some detainees may have lice, which\ncan easily spread to others in the facility, and some de-\ntainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail\nis required to provide medical treatment. In addition, if a\ndetainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed\nwith detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue.\n   Petitioner and the dissent would permit corrections\nofficers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here\n2     FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                 COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nonly if the officers have a reasonable basis for thinking\nthat a particular arrestee may present a danger to other\ndetainees or members of the jail staff. But as the Court\nexplains, corrections officers are often in a very poor posi-\ntion to make such a determination, and the threat to the\nhealth and safety of detainees and staff, should the offic-\ners miscalculate, is simply too great.\n   It is important to note, however, that the Court does not\nhold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip\nsearch of an arrestee whose detention has not been re-\nviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in avail-\nable facilities apart from the general population. Most of\nthose arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and\nmost are released from custody prior to or at the time of\ntheir initial appearance before a magistrate. In some\ncases, the charges are dropped. In others, arrestees are\nreleased either on their own recognizance or on minimal\nbail. In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration. For\nthese persons, admission to the general jail population,\nwith the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may\nnot be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure\nis feasible. For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) and possibly even some local jails appear to segre-\ngate temporary detainees who are minor offenders from\nthe general population. See, e.g., Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 30; Bull v. City & Cty. of San Francisco,\n595 F. 3d 964, 968 (CA9 2010) (en banc).*\n——————\n  * In its amicus brief, the United States informs us that, according to\nBOP policy, prison and jail officials cannot subject persons arrested for\nmisdemeanor or civil contempt offenses to visual body-cavity searches\nwithout their consent or without reasonable suspicion that they are\nconcealing contraband.

This question\nis phrased more broadly than what is at issue. The\ncase is limited to strip searches of those arrestees\nentering a jail’s general population, see 621 F. 3d 296,\n298 (CA3 2010). And the kind of strip search in ques-\ntion involves more than undressing and taking a\nshower (even if guards monitor the shower area for\nthreatened disorder). Rather, the searches here in-\nvolve close observation of the private areas of a per-\nson’s body and for that reason constitute a far more\nserious invasion of that person’s privacy.\n  The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue\nhere is not unique. A similar practice is well described\nin Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F. Supp. 2d 41\n(SDNY 2003). In that New York case, the “strip\nsearch” (as described in a relevant prison manual)\ninvolved:\n    “ ‘a visual inspection of the inmate’s naked body. This\n    should include the inmate opening his mouth and\n2    FLORENCE v.

For females, the procedures are similar ex-\n    cept females must in addition, squat to expose the\n    vagina.’ ” Id., at 46.\nBecause the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical\ninformation about the need for such a search in respect\nto minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in\nthis case do not differ significantly, I shall use the succinct\nDodge description as a template for the kind of strip\nsearch to which the Question Presented refers. See, e.g.,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 3a–4a (alleging that officers in-\nspected his genitals from an arm’s length away, required\nhim to lift his genitals, and examined his anal cavity).\n  In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a\nminor offense that does not involve drugs or violence—say\na traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil\nmatter, or any other such misdemeanor—is an “unreason-\nable searc[h]” forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless\nprison authorities have reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat the individual possesses drugs or other contraband.\nAnd I dissent from the Court’s contrary determination.\n                             I\n   Those confined in prison retain basic constitutional\nrights. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner\nv. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not\nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protec-\ntions of the Constitution”). The constitutional right at\nissue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of\n“unreasonable searches and seizures.” And, as the Court\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnotes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment\nbalancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates in\nBell v. Wolfish, supra. The Court said:\n    “The test of reasonableness under the Fourth\n    Amendment is not capable of precise definition or me-\n    chanical application. In each case it requires a bal-\n    ancing of the need for the particular search against\n    the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\n    Courts must consider the scope of the particular in-\n    trusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justi-\n    fication for initiating it, and the place in which it is\n    conducted.” Id., at 559.\nI have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the\nplace, scope and manner of “the particular intrusion.”\nBell, 441 U. S., at 559. I now explain why I believe that\nthe “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and\nlacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the cate-\ngory of minor offenders at issue.\n                             II\n   A strip search that involves a stranger peering without\nconsent at a naked individual, and in particular at the\nmost private portions of that person’s body, is a serious in-\nvasion of privacy. We have recently said, in respect to a\nschoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “mean-\ning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may\nreasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category\nof its own demanding its own specific suspicions.” Safford\nUnified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 11). The Courts of Appeals have more\ndirectly described the privacy interests at stake, writing,\nfor example, that practices similar to those at issue here\nare “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,\nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, [and] repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submission.” Mary Beth G. v.\n4    FLORENCE v.

Snow, 771\nF. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“ ‘[A]ll courts’ ” have recognized\nthe “ ‘ severe if not gross interference with a person’s pri-\nvacy’ ” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting\nArruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))). These\nkinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in\nBell, supra, at 558 (guards strip searched prisoners after\nthey received outside visits). Even when carried out in a\nrespectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,\nsee ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful,\nhumiliating, and degrading. And the harm to privacy\ninterests would seem particularly acute where the person\nsearched may well have no expectation of being subject\nto such a search, say, because she had simply received a\ntraffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he\nhad not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had\nbeen arrested for a minor trespass.\n   In Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001),\nfor example, police arrested a mother driving with her two\nchildren because their seat belts were not buckled. This\nCourt held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest\nfor a minor seatbelt offense. Id., at 323. But, in doing so,\nit pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour\n(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond)\nand that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jew-\nelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not\n“ ‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical inter-\nests.’ ” Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517\nU. S. 806, 818 (1996)). Would this Court have upheld the\narrest had the magistrate not been immediately available,\nhad the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had\nthey subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?\nCf. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56\n(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).\n   The petitioner, Albert W.

See ante, at 2 (ALITO, J. concurring) (“admission to\ngeneral jail population, with the concomitant humiliation\nof a strip search, may not be reasonable” for those “whose\ndetention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and\nwho could not be held in available facilities apart from the\n6    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ngeneral population”).\n  I need not go on. I doubt that we seriously disagree\nabout the nature of the strip search or about the serious\naffront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it\npresents. The basic question before us is whether such\na search is nonetheless justified when an individual ar-\nrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the\ngeneral jail or prison population.\n                              III\n    The majority, like the respondents, argues that strip\nsearches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such\nas lice, that might spread in confinement, (2) to identify\ngang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special hous-\ning to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, includ-\ning drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum,\nwhich might prove harmful or dangerous in prison. In\nevaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize:\nthat managing a jail or prison is an “inordinately difficult\nundertaking,” Turner, 482 U. S., at 85; that prison regula-\ntions that interfere with important constitutional interests\nare generally valid as long as they are “reasonably related\nto legitimate penological interests,” id., at 89; that finding\ninjuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing\nthe threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are\n“legitimate penological interests,” ibid.; and that we nor-\nmally defer to the expertise of jail and prison administra-\ntors in such matters, id., at 85.\n    Nonetheless, the “particular” invasion of interests, Bell,\n441 U. S., at 559, must be “ ‘reasonably related’ ” to the jus-\ntifying “penological interest” and the need must not be\n“ ‘exaggerated.’ ” Turner, supra, at 87. It is at this point\nthat I must part company with the majority. I have found\nno convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of\nreasonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those\narrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to fur-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nther the penal interests mentioned. And there are strong\nreasons to believe they are not justified.\n  The lack of justification is fairly obvious with respect to\nthe first two penological interests advanced. The searches\nalready employed at Essex and Burlington include: (a)\npat-frisking all inmates; (b) making inmates go through\nmetal detectors (including the Body Orifice Screening\nSystem (BOSS) chair used at Essex County Correctional\nFacility that identifies metal hidden within the body); (c)\nmaking inmates shower and use particular delousing\nagents or bathing supplies; and (d) searching inmates’\nclothing. In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees\ncould be lawfully subject to being viewed in their under-\ngarments by jail officers or during showering (for security\npurposes). Brief for Petitioner 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7–8\n(“Showering in the presence of officers is not something\nthat requires reasonable suspicion”). No one here has\noffered any reason, example, or empirical evidence sug-\ngesting the inadequacy of such practices for detecting\ninjuries, diseases, or tattoos. In particular, there is no\nconnection between the genital lift and the “squat and\ncough” that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health\nor gang concerns. See Brief for Academics on Gang Be-\nhavior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New\nJersey et al. as Amici Curiae.\n  The lack of justification for such a strip search is less\nobvious but no less real in respect to the third interest,\nnamely that of detecting contraband. The information\ndemonstrating the lack of justification is of three kinds.\nFirst, there are empirically based conclusions reached in\nspecific cases. The New York Federal District Court, to\nwhich I have referred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons\nadmitted to the Orange County correctional facility be-\ntween 1999 and 2003. Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69.\nThese 23,000 persons underwent a strip search of the kind\ndescribed, supra, at 1. Of these 23,000 persons, the court\n8    FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nwrote, “the County encountered three incidents of drugs\nrecovered from an inmate’s anal cavity and two incidents\nof drugs falling from an inmate’s underwear during the\ncourse of a strip search.” 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69. The\ncourt added that in four of these five instances there may\nhave been “reasonable suspicion” to search, leaving only\none instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy\n“arguably” detected additional contraband. Id., at 70. The\nstudy is imperfect, for search standards changed during\nthe time it was conducted. Id., at 50–51. But the large\nnumber of inmates, the small number of “incidents,” and\nthe District Court’s own conclusions make the study pro-\nbative though not conclusive.\n   Similarly, in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2\n2001), the court received data produced by the county\njail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip\nsearches, similar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new\ninmates over a period of five years. Brief for Plaintiff-\nAppellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00–7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16\n(citing to its App. 343a–493a). In 16 instances the\nsearches led to the discovery of contraband. The record\nfurther showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband\nwould have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes\nand outer-clothing. In the three instances in which contra-\nband was found on the detainee’s body or in a body cavity,\nthere was a drug or felony history that would have justi-\nfied a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion.\nIbid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as\nAmicus Curiae 10.\n   Second, there is the plethora of recommendations of\nprofessional bodies, such as correctional associations, that\nhave studied and thoughtfully considered the matter. The\nAmerican Correctional Association (ACA)—an association\nthat informs our view of “what is obtainable and what is\nacceptable in corrections philosophy,” Brown v. Plata, 563\nU.

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof Prisons (BOP) itself forbids suspicionless strip searches\nfor minor offenders, though it houses separately (and does\nnot admit to the general jail population) a person who does\nnot consent to such a search. See Dept. of Justice, BOP\nProgram Statement 5140.38, p. 5. (2004), http://www.\nbop.gov/policy/progstat/5140_038.pdf.\n   Third, there is general experience in areas where the\nlaw has forbidden here-relevant suspicionless searches.\nLaws in at least 10 States prohibit suspicionless strip\nsearches. See, e.g., Mo. Stat. Ann. §544.193.2 (2002) (“No\nperson arrested or detained for a traffic offense or an\noffense which does not constitute a felony may be subject\nto a strip search or a body cavity search . . . unless there is\nprobable cause to believe that such person is concealing a\nweapon . . . or contraband”); Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–2521(a)\n(2007) (similar); Iowa Code §804.30 (2009) (similar); 725\nIll. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, §5/103–1(c) (2011) (similar but\nrequiring “reasonable belief ”); 501 Ky. Admin. Regs.\n3:120, §3(1)(b) (2011) (similar); Tenn. Code Ann. §40–7–\n119 (2006) (similar); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–3–405(1)\n(2011) (no strip search absent individualized suspicion\nunless person has been arraigned and court orders that\nsuspect be detained); Fla. Stat. §901.211(2) (2010) (simi-\nlar); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §764.25a(2) (2000) (similar);\nWash. Rev. Code §10.79.130(1) (2010) (similar).\n   At the same time at least seven Courts of Appeals have\nconsidered the question and have required reasonable\nsuspicion that an arrestee is concealing weapons or con-\ntraband before a strip search of one arrested for a minor\noffense can take place. See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island,\n239 F. 3d 107, 112–113 (CA1 2001); Weber v. Dell, 804\nF. 2d 796, 802 (CA2 1986); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F. 2d\n1007, 1013 (CA4 1981); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty.

But see 621 F. 3d, at 311\n(case below); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco,\n595 F. 3d 964, 975 (CA9 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett,\n541 F. 3d 1298, 1307 (CA11 2008) (en banc). Respondents\nhave not presented convincing grounds to believe that\nadministration of these legal standards has increased the\nsmuggling of contraband into prison.\n   Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set\nforth any clear example of an instance in which contra-\nband was smuggled into the general jail population during\nintake that could not have been discovered if the jail was\nemploying a reasonable suspicion standard. The majority\ndoes cite general examples from Atlantic County and\nWashington State where contraband has been recovered\nin correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving\nunder the influence and disorderly conduct. Ante, at 15.\nSimilarly, the majority refers to information, provided by\nSan Francisco jail authorities, stating that they have\nfound handcuff keys, syringes, crack pipes, drugs, and\nknives during body-cavity searches, including during\nsearches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for\nillegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prosti-\ntution and public nuisance (“bindles of crack cocaine”).\nBrief for City and County of San Francisco et al. as Amici\nCuriae 7–13; Bull, supra, at 969; ante, at 15. And associ-\nated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual\ncavity searches of all those admitted to the general popu-\nlation in San Francisco may account for the discovery of\ncontraband in approximately 15 instances per year. Bull,\nsupra, at 969.\n   But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us\nwhether reasonable suspicion was present or absent in any\nof the 15 instances. Nor is there any showing by the\nmajority that the few unclear examples of contraband\nrecovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or any-\nwhere else could not have been discovered through a policy\n12   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat required reasonable suspicion for strip searches. And\nwithout some such indication, I am left without an exam-\nple of any instance in which contraband was found on an\nindividual through an inspection of their private parts or\nbody cavities which could not have been found under a\npolicy requiring reasonable suspicion. Hence, at a mini-\nmum these examples, including San Francisco’s statistics,\ndo not provide a significant counterweight to those pre-\nsented in Dodge and Shain.\n   Nor do I find the majority’s lack of examples surprising.\nAfter all, those arrested for minor offenses are often\nstopped and arrested unexpectedly. And they conse-\nquently will have had little opportunity to hide things in\ntheir body cavities. Thus, the widespread advocacy by\nprison experts and the widespread application in many\nStates and federal circuits of “reasonable suspicion” re-\nquirements indicates an ability to apply such standards in\npractice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal\ninterest in preventing the smuggling of contraband.\n   The majority is left with the word of prison officials in\nsupport of its contrary proposition. And though that word\nis important, it cannot be sufficient. Cf. Dept. of Justice,\nNational Institute of Corrections, W. Collins, Jails and the\nConstitution: An Overview 28–29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though\nprison officials often “passionately believed” similar re-\nquirements would lead to contraband-related security\nproblems, once those requirements were imposed those\n“problems did not develop”).\n   The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S. 520, itself.\nAnte, at 5–6. In that case, the Court considered a prison\npolicy requiring a strip search of all detainees after “con-\ntact visits” with unimprisoned visitors. 441 U. S., at 558.\nThe Court found that policy justified. Id., at 560. Con-\ntrary to the majority’s suggestion, that case does not pro-\nvide precedent for the proposition that the word of prison\nofficials (accompanied by a “single instance” of empirical\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nexample) is sufficient to support a strip search policy.\nAnte, at 6. The majority correctly points out that there\nwas but “one instance” in which the policy had led to the\ndiscovery of an effort to smuggle contraband. Bell, 441\nU. S., at 558. But the Court understood that the prison\nhad been open only four months. Id., at 526. And the\nCourt was also presented with other examples where\ninmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact\nvisits. Id., at 559.\n   It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison jus-\ntified in conducting postcontact searches even as to pre-\ntrial detainees who had been brought before a magistrate,\ndenied bail, and “committed to the detention facility only\nbecause no other less drastic means [could] reasonably\nassure [their] presence at trial.” 441 U. S., at 546, n. 28.\nThe Court recognized that those ordered detained by a\nmagistrate were often those “charged with serious crimes,\nor who have prior records.” Ibid. For that reason, those\ndetainees posed at least the same security risk as con-\nvicted inmates, if not “a greater risk to jail security and\norder,” and a “greater risk of escape.” Ibid. And, of\ncourse, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors\nhad the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case,\nunlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after\nan unexpected arrest).\n   The Bell Court had no occasion to focus upon those\narrested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial officer’s de-\ntermination that they should be committed to prison. I\nshare JUSTICE ALITO’s intuition that the calculus may be\ndifferent in such cases, given that “[m]ost of those arrested\nfor minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are re-\nleased from custody prior to or at the time of their initial\nappearance before a magistrate.” Ante, at 2 (concurring\nopinion). As he notes, this case does not address, and\n“reserves judgment on,” whether it is always reasonable\n“to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee’s detention\n14   FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF\n                COUNTY OF BURLINGTON\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhas been reviewed by a judicial officer.” Ante, at 3. In my\nview, it is highly questionable that officials would be\njustified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world\nof the general jail population and subjecting to a strip\nsearch someone with no criminal background arrested for\njaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.\nIndeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Fed-\neral Government and many States segregate such individ-\nuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions\nprovide that such individuals be released without deten-\ntion in the ordinary case. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§853.6 (West Supp. 2012).\n   In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for\nthe Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to\nadmit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail\npopulation, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip\nsearch,” prior to any review by a judicial officer. Ante, at 2\n(ALITO, J., concurring).\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for\nthe strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would\nsubject those arrested for minor offenses to serious inva-\nsions of their personal privacy. I consequently dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/626454/", "sha1": "6a1c6c790db1480978ea5058fa204d6a5fa2274a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-04-02T07:34:41"}
