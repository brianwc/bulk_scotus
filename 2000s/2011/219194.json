DUKES ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10–277.      Argued March 29, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011\nRespondents, current or former employees of petitioner Wal-Mart,\n  sought judgment against the company for injunctive and declaratory\n  relief, punitive damages, and backpay, on behalf of themselves and a\n  nationwide class of some 1.5 million female employees, because of\n  Wal-Mart’s alleged discrimination against women in violation of Title\n  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They claim that local managers\n  exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately\n  in favor of men, which has an unlawful disparate impact on female\n  employees; and that Wal-Mart’s refusal to cabin its managers’ au\n  thority amounts to disparate treatment. The District Court certified\n  the class, finding that respondents satisfied Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 23(a), and Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement of showing that “the\n  party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that\n  apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corre\n  sponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n  whole.” The Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed, concluding, inter\n  alia, that respondents met Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement\n  and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2)\n  class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory\n  and injunctive relief requests. It also ruled that the class action\n  could be manageably tried without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to\n  present its statutory defenses if the District Court selected a random\n  set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and\n  value of the untested claims from the sample set.\nHeld:\n    1. The certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with\n Rule 23(a). Pp. 8–20.\n       (a) Rule 23(a)(2) requires a party seeking class certification to\n2                 WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    prove that the class has common “questions of law or fact.” Their\n    claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that\n    it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determina\n    tion of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the\n    validity of each one of the claims in one stroke. Here, proof of com\n    monality necessarily overlaps with respondents’ merits contention\n    that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.\n    The crux of a Title VII inquiry is “the reason for a particular em\n    ployment decision,” Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467\n    U. S. 867, 876, and respondents wish to sue for millions of employ\n    ment decisions at once. Without some glue holding together the al\n    leged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that ex\n    amination of all the class members’ claims will produce a common\n    answer to the crucial discrimination question. Pp. 8–12.\n          (b) General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147,\n    describes the proper approach to commonality. On the facts of this\n    case, the conceptual gap between an individual’s discrimination claim\n    and “the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same\n    injury,” id., at 157–158, must be bridged by “[s]ignificant proof that\n    an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination,” id.,\n    at 159, n. 15. Such proof is absent here. Wal-Mart’s announced pol\n    icy forbids sex discrimination, and the company has penalties for de\n    nials of equal opportunity. Respondents’ only evidence of a general\n    discrimination policy was a sociologist’s analysis asserting that Wal-\n    Mart’s corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias. But be\n    cause he could not estimate what percent of Wal-Mart employment\n    decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testi\n    mony was worlds away from “significant proof” that Wal-Mart “oper\n    ated under a general policy of discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.\n          (c) The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence convinc\n    ingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of giving local supervisors\n    discretion over employment matters. While such a policy could be\n    the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim, recognizing that a\n    claim “can” exist does not mean that every employee in a company\n    with that policy has a common claim. In a company of Wal-Mart’s\n    size and geographical scope, it is unlikely that all managers would\n    exercise their discretion in a common way without some common di\n    rection. Respondents’ attempt to show such direction by means of\n    statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short. Pp. 14–20.\n       2. Respondents’ backpay claims were improperly certified under\n    Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 20–27.\n          (a) Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule\n    23(b)(2), at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the\n    requested injunctive or declaratory relief. It is unnecessary to decide\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  whether monetary claims can ever be certified under the Rule be\n  cause, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief, like backpay,\n  are excluded. Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single, indivisible\n  remedy would provide relief to each class member. The Rule’s his\n  tory and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims be\n  long instead in Rule 23(b)(3), with its procedural protections of pre\n  dominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out.\n  Pp. 20–23.\n       (b) Respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims\n  were appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims\n  do not “predominate” over their injunctive and declaratory relief re\n  quests. That interpretation has no basis in the Rule’s text and does\n  obvious violence to the Rule’s structural features. The mere “pre\n  dominance” of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify\n  eliminating Rule 23(b)(3)’s procedural protections, and creates incen\n  tives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid mone\n  tary relief claims. Moreover, a district court would have to reevalu\n  ate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who\n  leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunc\n  tive or declaratory relief. By contrast, in a properly certified (b)(3)\n  class action for backpay, it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs\n  are still employed at Wal-Mart. It follows that backpay claims\n  should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 23–26.\n       (c) It is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of “in\n  cidental” monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpre\n  tation of Rule 23(b)(2) and the Due Process Clause because respon\n  dents’ backpay claims are not incidental to their requested\n  injunction. Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of\n  each employee’s eligibility for backpay. Once a plaintiff establishes a\n  pattern or practice of discrimination, a district court must usually\n  conduct “additional proceedings . . . to determine the scope of indi\n  vidual relief.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 361. The\n  company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demon\n  strate that its action was lawful. Id., at 362. The Ninth Circuit erred\n  in trying to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. Because\n  Rule 23 cannot be interpreted to “abridge, enlarge or modify any sub\n  stantive right,” 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), a class cannot be certified on the\n  premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory de\n  fenses to individual claims.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals\napproved the certification of a class comprising about one\nand a half million plaintiffs, current and former female\nemployees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the\ndiscretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay\nand promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminat\ning against women. In addition to injunctive and declara\ntory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay. We\nconsider whether the certification of the plaintiff class\nwas consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nand (b)(2).\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation’s largest private\nemployer. It operates four types of retail stores through\nout the country: Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighbor\nhood Markets, and Sam’s Clubs. Those stores are divided\ninto seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41\nregions of 80 to 85 stores apiece. Each store has between\n2             WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff posi\ntions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400\nstores and employs more than one million people.\n   Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally\ncommitted to local managers’ broad discretion, which is\nexercised “in a largely subjective manner.” 222 F. R. D.\n137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004). Local store managers may in\ncrease the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with\nonly limited corporate oversight. As for salaried employ\nees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher\ncorporate authorities have discretion to set their pay with\nin preestablished ranges.\n   Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart per\nmits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria\nwhen selecting candidates as “support managers,” which is\nthe first step on the path to management. Admission to\nWal-Mart’s management training program, however, does\nrequire that a candidate meet certain objective criteria,\nincluding an above-average performance rating, at least\none year’s tenure in the applicant’s current position, and a\nwillingness to relocate. But except for those requirements,\nregional and district managers have discretion to use their\nown judgment when selecting candidates for management\ntraining. Promotion to higher office—e.g., assistant man\nager, co-manager, or store manager—is similarly at the\ndiscretion of the employee’s superiors after prescribed\nobjective factors are satisfied.\n                              B\n   The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit, representing the\n1.5 million members of the certified class, are three cur\nrent or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the\ncompany discriminated against them on the basis of their\nsex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\namended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1 et seq.1\n   Betty Dukes began working at a Pittsburg, California,\nWal-Mart in 1994. She started as a cashier, but later\nsought and received a promotion to customer service man\nager. After a series of disciplinary violations, however,\nDukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter.\nDukes concedes she violated company policy, but contends\nthat the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for\ninvoking internal complaint procedures and that male\nemployees have not been disciplined for similar infrac\ntions. Dukes also claims two male greeters in the Pitts\nburg store are paid more than she is.\n   Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam’s Club stores\nin Missouri and California for most of her adult life. She\nhas held a number of positions, including a supervisory\nposition. She claims that a male manager yelled at her\nfrequently and screamed at female employees, but not at\nmen. The manager in question “told her to ‘doll up,’ to\nwear some makeup, and to dress a little better.” App.\n1003a.\n   The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a\nWal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001.\nIn 2000, she approached the store manager on more than\none occasion about management training, but was brushed\noff. Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for\nadvancement because of her sex. She initiated internal\ncomplaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply\ndirectly to the district manager if she thought her store\nmanager was being unfair. Arana, however, decided\nagainst that and never applied for management training\nagain. In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with\nWal-Mart’s timekeeping policy.\n   These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that\n——————\n 1 The complaint included seven named plaintiffs, but only three re\n\nmain part of the certified class as narrowed by the Court of Appeals.\n4            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the\nadvancement of women. Rather, they claim that their\nlocal managers’ discretion over pay and promotions is\nexercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an\nunlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–2(k). And, respondents say, because Wal-\nMart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its manag\ners’ authority amounts to disparate treatment, see\n§2000e–2(a). Their complaint seeks injunctive and de\nclaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does\nnot ask for compensatory damages.\n  Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that\nthe discrimination to which they have been subjected is\ncommon to all Wal-Mart’s female employees. The basic\ntheory of their case is that a strong and uniform “corporate\nculture” permits bias against women to infect, perhaps\nsubconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each\none of Wal-Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby mak\ning every woman at the company the victim of one com\nmon discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish\nto litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at\nWal-Mart’s stores in a nationwide class action.\n                             C\n  Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23. Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certifi\ncation must demonstrate, first, that:\n       “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all mem-\n    bers is impracticable,\n       “(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\n    class,\n       “(3) the claims or defenses of the representative par\n    ties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,\n    and\n       “(4) the representative parties will fairly and ade\n    quately protect the interests of the class” (paragraph\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n     breaks added).\nSecond, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the\nthree requirements listed in Rule 23(b). Respondents rely\non Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing\nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.”2\n   Invoking these provisions, respondents moved the Dis\ntrict Court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of “ ‘[a]ll\nwomen employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store\nat any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or\nmay be subjected to Wal-Mart’s challenged pay and man\nagement track promotions policies and practices.’ ” 222\nF. R. D., at 141–142 (quoting Plaintiff ’s Motion for Class\nCertification in case No. 3:01–cv–02252–CRB (ND Cal.),\nDoc. 99, p. 37). As evidence that there were indeed “ques\ntions of law or fact common to” all the women of Wal-Mart,\nas Rule 23(a)(2) requires, respondents relied chiefly on\nthree forms of proof: statistical evidence about pay and\npromotion disparities between men and women at the\ncompany, anecdotal reports of discrimination from about\n120 of Wal-Mart’s female employees, and the testimony of\na sociologist, Dr. William Bielby, who conducted a “social\n\n——————\n   2 Rule 23(b)(1) allows a class to be maintained where “prosecuting\n\nseparate actions by or against individual class members would create a\nrisk of ” either “(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications,” or “(B)\nadjudications . . . that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the\ninterests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudica\ntions or would substantially impair or impeded their ability to protect\ntheir interests.” Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained\nwhere “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members,” and a class\naction would be “superior to other available methods for fairly and\nefficiently adjudicating the controversy.” The applicability of these\nprovisions to the plaintiff class is not before us.\n6               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nframework analysis” of Wal-Mart’s “culture” and person\nnel practices, and concluded that the company was “vul\nnerable” to gender discrimination. 603 F. 3d 571, 601\n(CA9 2010) (en banc).\n   Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this\nevidence. It also offered its own countervailing statistical\nand other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)’s require\nments of commonality, typicality, and adequate represen\ntation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents’\nmonetary claims for backpay could not be certified under\nRule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunc\ntive and declaratory relief, and second because the back\npay claims could not be manageably tried as a class with\nout depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain\nstatutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here,\nthe District Court granted respondents’ motion and certi\nfied their proposed class.3\n                               D\n   A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially af\nfirmed the District Court’s certification order. 603 F. 3d\n571. The majority concluded that respondents’ evidence of\ncommonality was sufficient to “raise the common question\nwhether Wal-Mart’s female employees nationwide were\nsubjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a\nnumber of independent discriminatory acts) that may\nhave worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in\nviolation of Title VII.” Id., at 612 (emphasis deleted). It\nalso agreed with the District Court that the named plain\ntiffs’ claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole\n——————\n   3 The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion\n\nopportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no\napplicant data could exist for such positions. 222 F. R. D. 137, 182 (ND\nCal. 2004). It also decided to afford class members notice of the ac\ntion and the right to opt-out of the class with respect to respondents’\npunitive-damages claim. Id., at 173.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto satisfy Rule 23(a)(3), and that they could serve as ade\nquate class representatives, see Rule 23(a)(4). Id., at 614–\n615. With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth\nCircuit held that respondents’ backpay claims could be\ncertified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not\n“predominat[e]” over the requests for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, meaning they were not “superior in\nstrength, influence, or authority” to the nonmonetary\nclaims. Id., at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).4\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action\ncould be manageably tried as a class action because the\nDistrict Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit\napproved in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767, 782–\n787 (1996). There compensatory damages for some 9,541\nclass members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at\nrandom, referring those claims to a special master for\nvaluation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of\nthe untested claims from the sample set. See 603 F. 3d, at\n625–626. The Court of Appeals “s[aw] no reason why a\nsimilar procedure to that used in Hilao could not be em\nployed in this case.” Id., at 627. It would allow Wal-Mart\n“to present individual defenses in the randomly selected\n‘sample cases,’ thus revealing the approximate percentage\nof class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was\ndue to something other than gender discrimination.”\nIbid., n. 56 (emphasis deleted).\n——————\n  4 To  enable that result, the Court of Appeals trimmed the (b)(2) class\nin two ways: First, it remanded that part of the certification order\nwhich included respondents’ punitive-damages claim in the (b)(2) class,\nso that the District Court might consider whether that might cause the\nmonetary relief to predominate. 603 F. 3d, at 621. Second, it accepted\nin part Wal-Mart’s argument that since class members whom it no\nlonger employed had no standing to seek injunctive or declaratory\nrelief, as to them monetary claims must predominate. It excluded from\nthe certified class “those putative class members who were no longer\nWal-Mart employees at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed,” id., at\n623 (emphasis added).\n8               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v.

Rule 23(a) ensures that the named\nplaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class\nwhose claims they wish to litigate.

Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 131–132 (2009). For example: Do all\nof us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our manag\ners have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful em\nployment practice? What remedies should we get? Recit\ning these questions is not sufficient to obtain class\ncertification. Commonality requires the plaintiff to dem\nonstrate that the class members “have suffered the same\ninjury,” Falcon, supra, at 157. This does not mean merely\nthat they have all suffered a violation of the same pro\nvision of law. Title VII, for example, can be violated in\nmany ways—by intentional discrimination, or by hiring\nand promotion criteria that result in disparate impact,\nand by the use of these practices on the part of many\ndifferent superiors in a single company. Quite obviously,\nthe mere claim by employees of the same company that\nthey have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate\nimpact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all\ntheir claims can productively be litigated at once. Their\nclaims must depend upon a common contention—for ex\nample, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of\nthe same supervisor. That common contention, moreover,\nmust be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide\nresolution—which means that determination of its truth\nor falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the valid\nity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\n     “What matters to class certification . . . is not the rais\n     ing of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but,\n     rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to gen\n——————\ncon, 457 U.

A\nparty seeking class certification must affirmatively dem\nonstrate his compliance with the Rule—that is, he must be\nprepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently nu\nmerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc. We\nrecognized in Falcon that “sometimes it may be necessary\nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming\nto rest on the certification question,” 457 U. S., at 160, and\nthat certification is proper only if “the trial court is satis\nfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of\nRule 23(a) have been satisfied,” id., at 161; see id., at 160\n(“[A]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a)\nremains . . . indispensable”).

S. 156, 177 (1974), is sometimes mistakenly cited to the con\ntrary: “We find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that\ngives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the\nmerits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as\na class action.” But in that case, the judge had conducted a preliminary\ninquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety\nof certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) (he had already done that, see\nid., at 165), but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule\n23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants. To the extent the quoted\nstatement goes beyond the permissibility of a merits inquiry for any\nother pretrial purpose, it is the purest dictum and is contradicted by\nour other cases.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

Federal Reserve Bank of Rich\nmond, 467 U. S. 867, 876 (1984). Here respondents wish\n\n——————\n   Perhaps the most common example of considering a merits question\nat the Rule 23 stage arises in class-action suits for securities fraud.\nRule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting only individ\nual members” would often be an insuperable barrier to class certifica\ntion, since each of the individual investors would have to prove reliance\non the alleged misrepresentation. But the problem dissipates if the\nplaintiffs can establish the applicability of the so-called “fraud on the\nmarket” presumption, which says that all traders who purchase stock\nin an efficient market are presumed to have relied on the accuracy of a\ncompany’s public statements. To invoke this presumption, the plain\ntiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification must prove that their shares were\ntraded on an efficient market, Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton\nCo., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5), an issue they will surely\nhave to prove again at trial in order to make out their case on the\nmerits.\n   7 In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to “establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that . . . discrimination was the com\npany’s standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the\nunusual practice.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358\n(1977); see also Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 772\n(1976). If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference\nthat all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and\nwill justify “an award of prospective relief,” such as “an injunctive order\nagainst the continuation of the discriminatory practice.” Teamsters,\nsupra, at 361.\n12            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto sue about literally millions of employment decisions at\nonce. Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for\nall those decisions together, it will be impossible to say\nthat examination of all the class members’ claims for relief\nwill produce a common answer to the crucial question why\nwas I disfavored.\n                             B\n  This Court’s opinion in Falcon describes how the com\nmonality issue must be approached. There an employee\nwho claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion\non account of race obtained certification of a class compris\ning all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all\napplicants wrongfully denied jobs. 457 U. S., at 152. We\nrejected that composite class for lack of commonality and\ntypicality, explaining:\n     “Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an in\n     dividual’s claim that he has been denied a promotion\n     [or higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his\n     otherwise unsupported allegation that the company\n     has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of\n     a class of persons who have suffered the same injury\n     as that individual, such that the individual’s claim\n     and the class claim will share common questions of\n     law or fact and that the individual’s claim will be typi\n     cal of the class claims.” Id., at 157–158.\nFalcon suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap\nmight be bridged. First, if the employer “used a biased\ntesting procedure to evaluate both applicants for employ\nment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of\nevery applicant or employee who might have been preju\ndiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality\nand typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).” Id., at 159,\nn. 15. Second, “[s]ignificant proof that an employer oper\nated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncould justify a class of both applicants and employees\nif the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and pro\nmotion practices in the same general fashion, such as\nthrough entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.”\nIbid. We think that statement precisely describes respon\ndents’ burden in this case. The first manner of bridging\nthe gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has\nno testing procedure or other companywide evaluation\nmethod that can be charged with bias. The whole point of\npermitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evalu\nating employees under a common standard.\n   The second manner of bridging the gap requires “signifi\ncant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general\npolicy of discrimination.” That is entirely absent here.\nWal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination,\nsee App. 1567a–1596a, and as the District Court recog\nnized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal\nemployment opportunity, 222 F. R. D., at 154. The only\nevidence of a “general policy of discrimination” respon\ndents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby,\ntheir sociological expert. Relying on “social framework”\nanalysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a “strong\ncorporate culture,” that makes it “ ‘vulnerable’ ” to “gender\nbias.” Id., at 152. He could not, however, “determine with\nany specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaning\nful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his\ndeposition . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calcu\nlate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment\ndecisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped\nthinking.” 222 F. R. D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The\nparties dispute whether Bielby’s testimony even met the\nstandards for the admission of expert testimony under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 702 and our Daubert case,\nsee Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509\n14               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 579 (1993).8 The District Court concluded that\nDaubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certifica\ntion stage of class-action proceedings. 222 F. R. D., at 191.\nWe doubt that is so, but even if properly considered,\nBielby’s testimony does nothing to advance respondents’\ncase. “[W]hether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employ\nment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by\nstereotyped thinking” is the essential question on which\nrespondents’ theory of commonality depends. If Bielby\nadmittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely\ndisregard what he has to say. It is worlds away from\n“significant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a gen\neral policy of discrimination.”\n                               C\n  The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence\nconvincingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of allowing\ndiscretion by local supervisors over employment matters.\nOn its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform\nemployment practice that would provide the commonality\nneeded for a class action; it is a policy against having\nuniform employment practices. It is also a very common\n——————\n  8 Bielby’s conclusions in this case have elicited criticism from the very\n\nscholars on whose conclusions he relies for his social-framework analy\nsis. See Monahan, Walker, & Mitchell, Contextual Evidence of Gender\nDiscrimination: The Ascendance of “Social Frameworks,” 94 Va.\nL. Rev. 1715, 1747 (2008) (“[Bielby’s] research into conditions and be\nhavior at Wal-Mart did not meet the standards expected of social\nscientific research into stereotyping and discrimination”); id., at 1745,\n1747 (“[A] social framework necessarily contains only general state\nments about reliable patterns of relations among variables . . . and goes\nno further. . . . Dr. Bielby claimed to present a social framework, but he\ntestified about social facts specific to Wal-Mart”); id., at 1747–1748\n(“Dr. Bielby’s report provides no verifiable method for measuring and\ntesting any of the variables that were crucial to his conclusions and\nreflects nothing more than Dr. Bielby’s ‘expert judgment’ about how\ngeneral stereotyping research applied to all managers across all of Wal-\nMart’s stores nationwide for the multi-year class period”).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand presumptively reasonable way of doing business—one\nthat we have said “should itself raise no inference of dis\ncriminatory conduct,” Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust,\n487 U. S. 977, 990 (1988).\n   To be sure, we have recognized that, “in appropriate\ncases,” giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be\nthe basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact\ntheory—since “an employer’s undisciplined system of\nsubjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same\neffects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional\ndiscrimination.” Id., at 990–991. But the recognition that\nthis type of Title VII claim “can” exist does not lead to\nthe conclusion that every employee in a company using a\nsystem of discretion has such a claim in common. To the\ncontrary, left to their own devices most managers in any\ncorporation—and surely most managers in a corporation\nthat forbids sex discrimination—would select sex-neutral,\nperformance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that\nproduce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to\nreward various attributes that produce disparate impact—\nsuch as scores on general aptitude tests or educational\nachievements, see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.\n424, 431–432 (1971). And still other managers may be\nguilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex\nbased disparity. In such a company, demonstrating the\ninvalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do noth\ning to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s. A party\nseeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to\nshow that all the employees’ Title VII claims will in fact\ndepend on the answers to common questions.\n   Respondents have not identified a common mode of exer\ncising discretion that pervades the entire company—aside\nfrom their reliance on Dr. Bielby’s social frameworks analy\nsis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart’s size\nand geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all\nmanagers would exercise their discretion in a common way\n16            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout some common direction. Respondents attempt to\nmake that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal\nevidence, but their evidence falls well short.\n   The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression\nanalyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician,\nand Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. Drogin con\nducted his analysis region-by-region, comparing the num\nber of women promoted into management positions with\nthe percentage of women in the available pool of hourly\nworkers. After considering regional and national data,\nDrogin concluded that “there are statistically significant\ndisparities between men and women at Wal-Mart . . .\n[and] these disparities . . . can be explained only by gender\ndiscrimination.” 603 F. 3d, at 604 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Bendick compared work-force data from\nWal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that\nWal-Mart “promotes a lower percentage of women than its\ncompetitors.” Ibid.\n   Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are\ninsufficient to establish that respondents’ theory can be\nproved on a classwide basis. In Falcon, we held that one\nnamed plaintiff ’s experience of discrimination was insuffi\ncient to infer that “discriminatory treatment is typical of\n[the employer’s employment] practices.” 457 U. S., at 158.\nA similar failure of inference arises here. As Judge Ikuta\nobserved in her dissent, “[i]nformation about disparities at\nthe regional and national level does not establish the\nexistence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise\nthe inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination\nis implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and\ndistrict level.” 603 F. 3d, at 637. A regional pay disparity,\nfor example, may be attributable to only a small set of\nWal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uni\nform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs’\ntheory of commonality depends.\n   There is another, more fundamental, respect in which\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondents’ statistical proof fails. Even if it established\n(as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs\nfrom the nationwide figures or the regional figures in all of\nWal-Mart’s 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate\nthat commonality of issue exists. Some managers will\nclaim that the availability of women, or qualified women,\nor interested women, in their stores’ area does not mirror\nthe national or regional statistics. And almost all of them\nwill claim to have been applying some sex-neutral,\nperformance-based criteria—whose nature and effects\nwill differ from store to store. In the landmark case of\nours which held that giving discretion to lower-level su\npervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a\ndisparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion conditioned\nthat holding on the corollary that merely proving that the\ndiscretionary system has produced a racial or sexual\ndisparity is not enough. “[T]he plaintiff must begin by\nidentifying the specific employment practice that is chal\nlenged.” Watson, 487 U. S., at 994; accord, Wards Cove\nPacking Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 656 (1989) (approv\ning that statement), superseded by statute on other\ngrounds, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). That is all the more\nnecessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certi\nfied. Other than the bare existence of delegated discre\ntion, respondents have identified no “specific employment\npractice”—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million\nclaims together. Merely showing that Wal-Mart’s policy of\ndiscretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity\ndoes not suffice.\n   Respondents’ anecdotal evidence suffers from the same\ndefects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference\nthat all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions\nare discriminatory. In Teamsters v. United States, 431\nU. S. 324 (1977), in addition to substantial statistical\nevidence of company-wide discrimination, the Government\n(as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial\n18              WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscrimination from particular individuals. See id., at\n338. That number was significant because the company\ninvolved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were\nminorities, id., at 337, and the class itself consisted of\naround 334 persons, United States v. T.I.M.E.-D. C., Inc.,\n517 F. 2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other\ngrounds, Teamsters, supra. The 40 anecdotes thus repre\nsented roughly one account for every eight members of\nthe class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the\nanecdotes came from individuals “spread throughout” the\ncompany who “for the most part” worked at the company’s\noperational centers that employed the largest numbers of\nthe class members. 517 F. 2d, at 315, and n. 30. Here, by\ncontrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting\nexperiences of discrimination—about 1 for every 12,500\nclass members—relating to only some 235 out of Wal-\nMart’s 3,400 stores. 603 F. 3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissent\ning). More than half of these reports are concentrated in\nonly six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri,\nTexas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or\ntwo anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about\nWal-Mart’s operations at all. Id., at 634–635, and n. 10.\nEven if every single one of these accounts is true, that\nwould not demonstrate that the entire company “oper\nate[s] under a general policy of discrimination,” Falcon,\nsupra, at 159, n. 15, which is what respondents must show\nto certify a companywide class.9\n  The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing\n——————\n  9 The dissent says that we have adopted “a rule that a discrimination\nclaim, if accompanied by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers\nproportionate to the size of the class.” Post, at 5, n. 4 (GINSBURG, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not quite accurate.\nA discrimination claimant is free to supply as few anecdotes as he\nwishes. But when the claim is that a company operates under a gen\neral policy of discrimination, a few anecdotes selected from literally\nmillions of employment decisions prove nothing at all.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

See post, at\n8–10 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). That is not so. We quite agree that for purposes of\nRule 23(a)(2) “ ‘[e]ven a single [common] question’ ” will do,\npost, at 10, n. 9 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence\nPrinciple and the Structure of the Class Action, 103\nColum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n. 110 (2003)). We consider\ndissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3)\nrequires) whether common questions predominate, but in\norder to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether\nthere is “[e]ven a single [common] question.” And there is\nnot here. Because respondents provide no convincing\nproof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion\npolicy, we have concluded that they have not established\nthe existence of any common question.10\n  In sum, we agree with Chief Judge Kozinski that the\nmembers of the class:\n     “held a multitude of different jobs, at different levels\n     of Wal-Mart’s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time,\n     in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a ka\n     leidoscope of supervisors (male and female), subject to\n     a variety of regional policies that all differed. . . .\n     Some thrived while others did poorly.

Our opinion in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v.\nBrown, 511 U. S. 117, 121 (1994) (per curiam) expressed\nserious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief\nmay be certified under that provision. We now hold that\nthey may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief\nis not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.\n                             A\n   Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole.” One possible reading of\nthis provision is that it applies only to requests for such\ninjunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the\nclass certification of monetary claims at all. We need not\nreach that broader question in this case, because we think\nthat, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like\nthe backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The\nkey to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the\ninjunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion\nthat the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared\nunlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none\nof them.” Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132. In other\nwords, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction\nor declaratory judgment would provide relief to each\nmember of the class. It does not authorize class certifica\ntion when each individual class member would be entitled\nto a different injunction or declaratory judgment against\nthe defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certi\nfication when each class member would be entitled to an\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Windsor,\n521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we\nhave previously looked to the historical models on which\nthe Rule was based, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 841–845 (1999). As we observed in Amchem, “[c]ivil\nrights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class\nbased discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is\nmeant to capture. 521 U. S., at 614. In particular, the\nRule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to\nracial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single\nclasswide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory\nCommittee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the\nplaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with\ntheir classwide injunction.

S. 979 (1956).\n  Permitting the combination of individualized and class\nwide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the\nstructure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) and\n(b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class\ntreatment—that individual adjudications would be impos\nsible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,11 or that the relief\n——————\n  11 Rule 23(b)(1) applies where separate actions by or against individ\n\nual class members would create a risk of “establish[ing] incompatible\nstandards of conduct for the party opposing the class,” Rule 23(b)(1)(A),\nsuch as “where the party is obliged by law to treat the members of the\nclass alike,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 614\n(1997), or where individual adjudications “as a practical matter, would\nbe dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the\n22               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsought must perforce affect the entire class at once, as in a\n(b)(2) class. For that reason these are also mandatory\nclasses: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or\n(b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige\nthe District Court to afford them notice of the action. Rule\n23(b)(3), by contrast, is an “adventuresome innovation” of\nthe 1966 amendments, Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted), framed for situations “in\nwhich ‘class-action treatment is not as clearly called for’,”\nid., at 615 (quoting Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28\nU. S. C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)). It allows class certifica\ntion in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater\nprocedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that “the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members pre\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and\n(b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class\nmembers are entitled to receive “the best notice that is\npracticable under the circumstances” and to withdraw\nfrom the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).\n   Given that structure, we think it clear that individ\nualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3). The\nprocedural protections attending the (b)(3) class—\npredominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the\nright to opt out—are missing from (b)(2) not because the\nRule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers\nthem unnecessary to a (b)(2) class. When a class seeks an\nindivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once,\nthere is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into\n\n——————\nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their\nability to protect their interests,” Rule 23(b)(1)(B), such as in “ ‘limited\nfund’ cases, . . . in which numerous persons make claims against a fund\ninsufficient to satisfy all claims,” Amchem, supra, at 614.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether class issues predominate or whether class action\nis a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Pre\ndominance and superiority are self-evident. But with\nrespect to each class member’s individualized claim for\nmoney, that is not so—which is precisely why (b)(3) re\nquires the judge to make findings about predominance and\nsuperiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does\nnot require that class members be given notice and opt-\nout rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or\nwrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is\nmandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue\nin this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In\nthe context of a class action predominantly for money\ndamages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out\nviolates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,\n472 U. S. 797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that\nto be so where the monetary claims do not predominate,\nthe serious possibility that it may be so provides an addi\ntional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the\nmonetary claims here.\n                               B\n   Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their\nclaims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of\na class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not\n“predominate” over their requests for injunctive and de\nclaratory relief. They rely upon the Advisory Committee’s\nstatement that Rule 23(b)(2) “does not extend to cases in\nwhich the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or\npredominantly to money damages.” 39 F. R. D., at 102\n(emphasis added). The negative implication, they argue,\nis that it does extend to cases in which the appropriate\nfinal relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to\nmoney damages. Of course it is the Rule itself, not the\nAdvisory Committee’s description of it, that governs. And\na mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to\n24           WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish a disposition that has no basis in the Rule’s text,\nand that does obvious violence to the Rule’s structural\nfeatures. The mere “predominance” of a proper (b)(2)\ninjunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of Rule\n23(b)(3)’s procedural protections: It neither establishes the\nsuperiority of class adjudication over individual adjudica\ntion nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to\nsee why the Rule should be read to nullify these protec\ntions whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its\nmonetary claims with a request—even a “predominating\nrequest”—for an injunction.\n   Respondents’ predominance test, moreover, creates\nperverse incentives for class representatives to place at\nrisk potentially valid claims for monetary relief. In this\ncase, for example, the named plaintiffs declined to include\nemployees’ claims for compensatory damages in their\ncomplaint. That strategy of including only backpay claims\nmade it more likely that monetary relief would not “pre\ndominate.” But it also created the possibility (if the pre\ndominance test were correct) that individual class mem\nbers’ compensatory-damages claims would be precluded by\nlitigation they had no power to hold themselves apart\nfrom. If it were determined, for example, that a particular\nclass member is not entitled to backpay because her denial\nof increased pay or a promotion was not the product of\ndiscrimination, that employee might be collaterally es\ntopped from independently seeking compensatory dam\nages based on that same denial. That possibility under\nscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary\nclaims to decide for themselves whether to tie their fates to\nthe class representatives’ or go it alone—a choice Rule\n23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have.\n   The predominance test would also require the District\nCourt to reevaluate the roster of class members continu\nally. The Ninth Circuit recognized the necessity for this\nwhen it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby Wal-Mart lack standing to seek injunctive or declara\ntory relief against its employment practices. The Court of\nAppeals’ response to that difficulty, however, was not to\neliminate all former employees from the certified class,\nbut to eliminate only those who had left the company’s\nemploy by the date the complaint was filed. That solution\nhas no logical connection to the problem, since those who\nhave left their Wal-Mart jobs since the complaint was filed\nhave no more need for prospective relief than those who\nleft beforehand. As a consequence, even though the valid\nity of a (b)(2) class depends on whether “final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole,” Rule 23(b)(2) (emphasis\nadded), about half the members of the class approved by\nthe Ninth Circuit have no claim for injunctive or declara\ntory relief at all. Of course, the alternative (and logical)\nsolution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave\ntheir employment may have struck the Court of Appeals\nas wasteful of the District Court’s time. Which indeed it\nis, since if a backpay action were properly certified for\nclass treatment under (b)(3), the ability to litigate a plain\ntiff ’s backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on\nthe irrelevant question whether she is still employed at\nWal-Mart. What follows from this, however, is not that\nsome arbitrary limitation on class membership should be\nimposed but that the backpay claims should not be certi\nfied under Rule 23(b)(2) at all.\n   Finally, respondents argue that their backpay claims\nare appropriate for a (b)(2) class action because a backpay\naward is equitable in nature. The latter may be true, but\nit is irrelevant. The Rule does not speak of “equitable”\nremedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory\njudgments. As Title VII itself makes pellucidly clear,\nbackpay is neither. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B)(i)\nand (ii) (distinguishing between declaratory and injunc\ntive relief and the payment of “backpay,” see §2000e–\n26             WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n5(g)(2)(A)).\n                              C\n   In Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F. 3d 402, 415\n(CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would\npermit the certification of monetary relief that is “inciden\ntal to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,” which it\ndefined as “damages that flow directly from liability to\nthe class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the\ninjunctive or declaratory relief.” In that court’s view, such\n“incidental damage should not require additional hearings\nto resolve the disparate merits of each individual’s case; it\nshould neither introduce new substantial legal or factual\nissues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.”\nIbid. We need not decide in this case whether there are\nany forms of “incidental” monetary relief that are consis\ntent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have\nannounced and that comply with the Due Process Clause.\nRespondents do not argue that they can satisfy this stan\ndard, and in any event they cannot.\n   Contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s view, Wal-Mart is enti\ntled to individualized determinations of each employee’s\neligibility for backpay. Title VII includes a detailed reme\ndial scheme. If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an\nemployer has discriminated against him in violation of the\nstatute, the court “may enjoin the respondent from en\ngaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order\nsuch affirmative action as may be appropriate, [including]\nreinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without\nbackpay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court\ndeems appropriate.” §2000e–5(g)(1). But if the employer\ncan show that it took an adverse employment action\nagainst an employee for any reason other than discrimina\ntion, the court cannot order the “hiring, reinstatement, or\npromotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment\nto him of any backpay.” §2000e–5(g)(2)(A).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have established a procedure for trying pattern-or\npractice cases that gives effect to these statutory require\nments. When the plaintiff seeks individual relief such as\nreinstatement or backpay after establishing a pattern or\npractice of discrimination, “a district court must usually\nconduct additional proceedings . . . to determine the scope\nof individual relief.” Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 361. At this\nphase, the burden of proof will shift to the company, but it\nwill have the right to raise any individual affirmative\ndefenses it may have, and to “demonstrate that the indi\nvidual applicant was denied an employment opportunity\nfor lawful reasons.” Id., at 362.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that it was possible to\nreplace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. A sample\nset of the class members would be selected, as to whom\nliability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a\nresult would be determined in depositions supervised by a\nmaster. The percentage of claims determined to be valid\nwould then be applied to the entire remaining class, and\nthe number of (presumptively) valid claims thus derived\nwould be multiplied by the average backpay award in the\nsample set to arrive at the entire class recovery—without\nfurther individualized proceedings. 603 F. 3d, at 625–627.\nWe disapprove that novel project. Because the Rules\nEnabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to “abridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U. S. C.\n§2072(b); see Ortiz, 527 U. S., at 845, a class cannot be\ncertified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled\nto litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims. And\nbecause the necessity of that litigation will prevent back\npay from being “incidental” to the classwide injunction,\nrespondents’ class could not be certified even assuming,\narguendo, that “incidental” monetary relief can be\nawarded to a 23(b)(2) class.\n                      *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n                                                  Reversed.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

The prac\ntice of delegating to supervisors large discretion to make\npersonnel decisions, uncontrolled by formal standards, has\nlong been known to have the potential to produce dispa\nrate effects. Managers, like all humankind, may be prey\nto biases of which they are unaware.6 The risk of dis\ncrimination is heightened when those managers are pre\ndominantly of one sex, and are steeped in a corporate\nculture that perpetuates gender stereotypes.\n   The plaintiffs’ allegations resemble those in one of the\n——————\n  5 The Court asserts that Drogin showed only average differences at\n\nthe “regional and national level” between male and female employees.\nAnte, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Rev.,\nat 131 (Rule 23(b)(3) requires “some decisive degree of\nsimilarity across the proposed class” because it “speaks\nof common ‘questions’ that ‘predominate’ over individual\nones”).9 “The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry” is\nmeant to “tes[t] whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 623\n(1997). If courts must conduct a “dissimilarities” analysis\nat the Rule 23(a)(2) stage, no mission remains for Rule\n23(b)(3).\n   Because Rule 23(a) is also a prerequisite for Rule\n23(b)(1) and Rule 23(b)(2) classes, the Court’s “dissimilari\nties” position is far reaching.       Individual differences\nshould not bar a Rule 23(b)(1) or Rule 23(b)(2) class, so\nlong as the Rule 23(a) threshold is met. See Amchem\nProducts, 521 U.

Argued March 29, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011\nRespondents, current or former employees of petitioner Wal-Mart,\n  sought judgment against the company for injunctive and declaratory\n  relief, punitive damages, and backpay, on behalf of themselves and a\n  nationwide class of some 1.5 million female employees, because of\n  Wal-Mart’s alleged discrimination against women in violation of Title\n  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They claim that local managers\n  exercise their discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately\n  in favor of men, which has an unlawful disparate impact on female\n  employees; and that Wal-Mart’s refusal to cabin its managers’ au\n  thority amounts to disparate treatment. The District Court certified\n  the class, finding that respondents satisfied Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 23(a), and Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement of showing that “the\n  party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that\n  apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corre\n  sponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n  whole.” The Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed, concluding, inter\n  alia, that respondents met Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement\n  and that their backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2)\n  class because those claims did not predominate over the declaratory\n  and injunctive relief requests. It also ruled that the class action\n  could be manageably tried without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to\n  present its statutory defenses if the District Court selected a random\n  set of claims for valuation and then extrapolated the validity and\n  value of the untested claims from the sample set.\nHeld:\n    1. The certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with\n Rule 23(a). Pp. 8–20.\n       (a) Rule 23(a)(2) requires a party seeking class certification to\n2                 WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    prove that the class has common “questions of law or fact.” Their\n    claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that\n    it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determina\n    tion of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the\n    validity of each one of the claims in one stroke. Here, proof of com\n    monality necessarily overlaps with respondents’ merits contention\n    that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.\n    The crux of a Title VII inquiry is “the reason for a particular em\n    ployment decision,” Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467\n    U. S. 867, 876, and respondents wish to sue for millions of employ\n    ment decisions at once. Without some glue holding together the al\n    leged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that ex\n    amination of all the class members’ claims will produce a common\n    answer to the crucial discrimination question. Pp. 8–12.\n          (b) General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147,\n    describes the proper approach to commonality. On the facts of this\n    case, the conceptual gap between an individual’s discrimination claim\n    and “the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same\n    injury,” id., at 157–158, must be bridged by “[s]ignificant proof that\n    an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination,” id.,\n    at 159, n. 15. Such proof is absent here. Wal-Mart’s announced pol\n    icy forbids sex discrimination, and the company has penalties for de\n    nials of equal opportunity. Respondents’ only evidence of a general\n    discrimination policy was a sociologist’s analysis asserting that Wal-\n    Mart’s corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias. But be\n    cause he could not estimate what percent of Wal-Mart employment\n    decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testi\n    mony was worlds away from “significant proof” that Wal-Mart “oper\n    ated under a general policy of discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.\n          (c) The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence convinc\n    ingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of giving local supervisors\n    discretion over employment matters. While such a policy could be\n    the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim, recognizing that a\n    claim “can” exist does not mean that every employee in a company\n    with that policy has a common claim. In a company of Wal-Mart’s\n    size and geographical scope, it is unlikely that all managers would\n    exercise their discretion in a common way without some common di\n    rection. Respondents’ attempt to show such direction by means of\n    statistical and anecdotal evidence falls well short. Pp. 14–20.\n       2. Respondents’ backpay claims were improperly certified under\n    Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 20–27.\n          (a) Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule\n    23(b)(2), at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the\n    requested injunctive or declaratory relief. It is unnecessary to decide\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single, indivisible\n  remedy would provide relief to each class member. The Rule’s his\n  tory and structure indicate that individualized monetary claims be\n  long instead in Rule 23(b)(3), with its procedural protections of pre\n  dominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out.\n  Pp. 20–23.\n       (b) Respondents nonetheless argue that their backpay claims\n  were appropriately certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims\n  do not “predominate” over their injunctive and declaratory relief re\n  quests. That interpretation has no basis in the Rule’s text and does\n  obvious violence to the Rule’s structural features. The mere “pre\n  dominance” of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify\n  eliminating Rule 23(b)(3)’s procedural protections, and creates incen\n  tives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid mone\n  tary relief claims. Moreover, a district court would have to reevalu\n  ate the roster of class members continuously to excise those who\n  leave their employment and become ineligible for classwide injunc\n  tive or declaratory relief. By contrast, in a properly certified (b)(3)\n  class action for backpay, it would be irrelevant whether the plaintiffs\n  are still employed at Wal-Mart. It follows that backpay claims\n  should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). Pp. 23–26.\n       (c) It is unnecessary to decide whether there are any forms of “in\n  cidental” monetary relief that are consistent with the above interpre\n  tation of Rule 23(b)(2) and the Due Process Clause because respon\n  dents’ backpay claims are not incidental to their requested\n  injunction. Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of\n  each employee’s eligibility for backpay. Once a plaintiff establishes a\n  pattern or practice of discrimination, a district court must usually\n  conduct “additional proceedings . . . to determine the scope of indi\n  vidual relief.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 361. The\n  company can then raise individual affirmative defenses and demon\n  strate that its action was lawful. Id., at 362. The Ninth Circuit erred\n  in trying to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. Because\n  Rule 23 cannot be interpreted to “abridge, enlarge or modify any sub\n  stantive right,” 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), a class cannot be certified on the\n  premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory de\n  fenses to individual claims.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals\napproved the certification of a class comprising about one\nand a half million plaintiffs, current and former female\nemployees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the\ndiscretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay\nand promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminat\ning against women. In addition to injunctive and declara\ntory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay. We\nconsider whether the certification of the plaintiff class\nwas consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nand (b)(2).\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation’s largest private\nemployer. It operates four types of retail stores through\nout the country: Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighbor\nhood Markets, and Sam’s Clubs. Those stores are divided\ninto seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41\nregions of 80 to 85 stores apiece. Each store has between\n2             WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff posi\ntions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400\nstores and employs more than one million people.\n   Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally\ncommitted to local managers’ broad discretion, which is\nexercised “in a largely subjective manner.” 222 F. R. D.\n137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004). Local store managers may in\ncrease the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with\nonly limited corporate oversight. As for salaried employ\nees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher\ncorporate authorities have discretion to set their pay with\nin preestablished ranges.\n   Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart per\nmits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria\nwhen selecting candidates as “support managers,” which is\nthe first step on the path to management. Admission to\nWal-Mart’s management training program, however, does\nrequire that a candidate meet certain objective criteria,\nincluding an above-average performance rating, at least\none year’s tenure in the applicant’s current position, and a\nwillingness to relocate. But except for those requirements,\nregional and district managers have discretion to use their\nown judgment when selecting candidates for management\ntraining. Promotion to higher office—e.g., assistant man\nager, co-manager, or store manager—is similarly at the\ndiscretion of the employee’s superiors after prescribed\nobjective factors are satisfied.\n                              B\n   The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit, representing the\n1.5 million members of the certified class, are three cur\nrent or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the\ncompany discriminated against them on the basis of their\nsex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

C. §2000e–1 et seq.1\n   Betty Dukes began working at a Pittsburg, California,\nWal-Mart in 1994. She started as a cashier, but later\nsought and received a promotion to customer service man\nager. After a series of disciplinary violations, however,\nDukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter.\nDukes concedes she violated company policy, but contends\nthat the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for\ninvoking internal complaint procedures and that male\nemployees have not been disciplined for similar infrac\ntions. Dukes also claims two male greeters in the Pitts\nburg store are paid more than she is.\n   Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam’s Club stores\nin Missouri and California for most of her adult life. She\nhas held a number of positions, including a supervisory\nposition. She claims that a male manager yelled at her\nfrequently and screamed at female employees, but not at\nmen. The manager in question “told her to ‘doll up,’ to\nwear some makeup, and to dress a little better.” App.\n1003a.\n   The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a\nWal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001.\nIn 2000, she approached the store manager on more than\none occasion about management training, but was brushed\noff. Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for\nadvancement because of her sex. She initiated internal\ncomplaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply\ndirectly to the district manager if she thought her store\nmanager was being unfair. Arana, however, decided\nagainst that and never applied for management training\nagain. In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with\nWal-Mart’s timekeeping policy.\n   These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that\n——————\n 1 The complaint included seven named plaintiffs, but only three re\n\nmain part of the certified class as narrowed by the Court of Appeals.\n4            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the\nadvancement of women. Rather, they claim that their\nlocal managers’ discretion over pay and promotions is\nexercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an\nunlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–2(k). And, respondents say, because Wal-\nMart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its manag\ners’ authority amounts to disparate treatment, see\n§2000e–2(a). Their complaint seeks injunctive and de\nclaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does\nnot ask for compensatory damages.\n  Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that\nthe discrimination to which they have been subjected is\ncommon to all Wal-Mart’s female employees. The basic\ntheory of their case is that a strong and uniform “corporate\nculture” permits bias against women to infect, perhaps\nsubconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each\none of Wal-Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby mak\ning every woman at the company the victim of one com\nmon discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish\nto litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at\nWal-Mart’s stores in a nationwide class action.\n                             C\n  Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23. Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certifi\ncation must demonstrate, first, that:\n       “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all mem-\n    bers is impracticable,\n       “(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\n    class,\n       “(3) the claims or defenses of the representative par\n    ties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,\n    and\n       “(4) the representative parties will fairly and ade\n    quately protect the interests of the class” (paragraph\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n     breaks added).\nSecond, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the\nthree requirements listed in Rule 23(b). Respondents rely\non Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing\nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole.”2\n   Invoking these provisions, respondents moved the Dis\ntrict Court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of “ ‘[a]ll\nwomen employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store\nat any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or\nmay be subjected to Wal-Mart’s challenged pay and man\nagement track promotions policies and practices.’ ” 222\nF. R. D., at 141–142 (quoting Plaintiff ’s Motion for Class\nCertification in case No. 3:01–cv–02252–CRB (ND Cal.),\nDoc. 99, p. 37). As evidence that there were indeed “ques\ntions of law or fact common to” all the women of Wal-Mart,\nas Rule 23(a)(2) requires, respondents relied chiefly on\nthree forms of proof: statistical evidence about pay and\npromotion disparities between men and women at the\ncompany, anecdotal reports of discrimination from about\n120 of Wal-Mart’s female employees, and the testimony of\na sociologist, Dr. William Bielby, who conducted a “social\n\n——————\n   2 Rule 23(b)(1) allows a class to be maintained where “prosecuting\n\nseparate actions by or against individual class members would create a\nrisk of ” either “(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications,” or “(B)\nadjudications . . . that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the\ninterests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudica\ntions or would substantially impair or impeded their ability to protect\ntheir interests.” Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained\nwhere “questions of law or fact common to class members predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members,” and a class\naction would be “superior to other available methods for fairly and\nefficiently adjudicating the controversy.” The applicability of these\nprovisions to the plaintiff class is not before us.\n6               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nframework analysis” of Wal-Mart’s “culture” and person\nnel practices, and concluded that the company was “vul\nnerable” to gender discrimination. 603 F. 3d 571, 601\n(CA9 2010) (en banc).\n   Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this\nevidence. It also offered its own countervailing statistical\nand other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)’s require\nments of commonality, typicality, and adequate represen\ntation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents’\nmonetary claims for backpay could not be certified under\nRule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunc\ntive and declaratory relief, and second because the back\npay claims could not be manageably tried as a class with\nout depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain\nstatutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here,\nthe District Court granted respondents’ motion and certi\nfied their proposed class.3\n                               D\n   A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially af\nfirmed the District Court’s certification order. 603 F. 3d\n571. The majority concluded that respondents’ evidence of\ncommonality was sufficient to “raise the common question\nwhether Wal-Mart’s female employees nationwide were\nsubjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a\nnumber of independent discriminatory acts) that may\nhave worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in\nviolation of Title VII.” Id., at 612 (emphasis deleted). It\nalso agreed with the District Court that the named plain\ntiffs’ claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole\n——————\n   3 The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion\n\nopportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no\napplicant data could exist for such positions. 222 F. R. D. 137, 182 (ND\nCal. 2004). It also decided to afford class members notice of the ac\ntion and the right to opt-out of the class with respect to respondents’\npunitive-damages claim. Id., at 173.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto satisfy Rule 23(a)(3), and that they could serve as ade\nquate class representatives, see Rule 23(a)(4). Id., at 614–\n615. With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth\nCircuit held that respondents’ backpay claims could be\ncertified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not\n“predominat[e]” over the requests for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, meaning they were not “superior in\nstrength, influence, or authority” to the nonmonetary\nclaims. Id., at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).4\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action\ncould be manageably tried as a class action because the\nDistrict Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit\napproved in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F. 3d 767, 782–\n787 (1996). There compensatory damages for some 9,541\nclass members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at\nrandom, referring those claims to a special master for\nvaluation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of\nthe untested claims from the sample set. See 603 F. 3d, at\n625–626. The Court of Appeals “s[aw] no reason why a\nsimilar procedure to that used in Hilao could not be em\nployed in this case.” Id., at 627. It would allow Wal-Mart\n“to present individual defenses in the randomly selected\n‘sample cases,’ thus revealing the approximate percentage\nof class members whose unequal pay or nonpromotion was\ndue to something other than gender discrimination.”\nIbid., n. 56 (emphasis deleted).\n——————\n  4 To  enable that result, the Court of Appeals trimmed the (b)(2) class\nin two ways: First, it remanded that part of the certification order\nwhich included respondents’ punitive-damages claim in the (b)(2) class,\nso that the District Court might consider whether that might cause the\nmonetary relief to predominate. 603 F. 3d, at 621. Second, it accepted\nin part Wal-Mart’s argument that since class members whom it no\nlonger employed had no standing to seek injunctive or declaratory\nrelief, as to them monetary claims must predominate. It excluded from\nthe certified class “those putative class members who were no longer\nWal-Mart employees at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed,” id., at\n623 (emphasis added).\n8               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n   The class action is “an exception to the usual rule that\nlitigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual\nnamed parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,\n700–701 (1979). In order to justify a departure from that\nrule, “a class representative must be part of the class and\n‘possess the same interest and suffer the same injury’ as\nthe class members.” East Tex. Motor Freight System,\nInc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U. S. 395, 403 (1977) (quoting\nSchlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S.\n208, 216 (1974)). Rule 23(a) ensures that the named\nplaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class\nwhose claims they wish to litigate. The Rule’s four\nrequirements—numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\nadequate representation—“effectively ‘limit the class\nclaims to those fairly encompassed by the named plain\ntiff ’s claims.’ ” General Telephone Co. of Southwest v.\nFalcon, 457 U. S. 147, 156 (1982) (quoting General Tele\nphone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC, 446 U. S. 318, 330\n(1980)).\n                             A\n  The crux of this case is commonality—the rule requiring\na plaintiff to show that “there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.” Rule 23(a)(2).5 That language is\n——————\n  5 We have previously stated in this context that “[t]he commonality\n\nand typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge. Both serve as\nguideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances\nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named\nplaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the inter\nests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in\ntheir absence. Those requirements therefore also tend to merge with\nthe adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter\nrequirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel\nand conflicts of interest.” General Telephone Co. of Southwest v.

Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 131–132 (2009). For example: Do all\nof us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our manag\ners have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful em\nployment practice? What remedies should we get? Recit\ning these questions is not sufficient to obtain class\ncertification. Commonality requires the plaintiff to dem\nonstrate that the class members “have suffered the same\ninjury,” Falcon, supra, at 157. This does not mean merely\nthat they have all suffered a violation of the same pro\nvision of law. Title VII, for example, can be violated in\nmany ways—by intentional discrimination, or by hiring\nand promotion criteria that result in disparate impact,\nand by the use of these practices on the part of many\ndifferent superiors in a single company. Quite obviously,\nthe mere claim by employees of the same company that\nthey have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate\nimpact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all\ntheir claims can productively be litigated at once. Their\nclaims must depend upon a common contention—for ex\nample, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of\nthe same supervisor. That common contention, moreover,\nmust be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide\nresolution—which means that determination of its truth\nor falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the valid\nity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\n     “What matters to class certification . . . is not the rais\n     ing of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but,\n     rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to gen\n——————\ncon, 457 U. S. 147, 157–158, n. 13 (1982). In light of our disposition of\nthe commonality question, however, it is unnecessary to resolve\nwhether respondents have satisfied the typicality and adequate\nrepresentation requirements of Rule 23(a).\n10              WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     erate common answers apt to drive the resolution of\n     the litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed\n     class are what have the potential to impede the gen\n     eration of common answers.” Nagareda, supra, at 132.\n    Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. A\nparty seeking class certification must affirmatively dem\nonstrate his compliance with the Rule—that is, he must be\nprepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently nu\nmerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc. We\nrecognized in Falcon that “sometimes it may be necessary\nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming\nto rest on the certification question,” 457 U. S., at 160, and\nthat certification is proper only if “the trial court is satis\nfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of\nRule 23(a) have been satisfied,” id., at 161; see id., at 160\n(“[A]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a)\nremains . . . indispensable”). Frequently that “rigorous\nanalysis” will entail some overlap with the merits of\nthe plaintiff ’s underlying claim. That cannot be helped.\n“ ‘[T]he class determination generally involves considera\ntions that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues\ncomprising the plaintiff ’s cause of action.’ ” Falcon, supra,\nat 160 (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.\n463, 469 (1978); some internal quotation marks omitted).6\n——————\n   6 A statement in one of our prior cases, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,\n\n417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974), is sometimes mistakenly cited to the con\ntrary: “We find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that\ngives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the\nmerits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as\na class action.” But in that case, the judge had conducted a preliminary\ninquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety\nof certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) (he had already done that, see\nid., at 165), but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule\n23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants. To the extent the quoted\nstatement goes beyond the permissibility of a merits inquiry for any\nother pretrial purpose, it is the purest dictum and is contradicted by\nour other cases.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nNor is there anything unusual about that consequence:\nThe necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to\nresolve preliminary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue,\nis a familiar feature of litigation. See Szabo v. Bridgeport\nMachines, Inc., 249 F. 3d 672, 676–677 (CA7 2001)\n(Easterbrook, J.).\n   In this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps\nwith respondents’ merits contention that Wal-Mart en\ngages in a pattern or practice of discrimination.7 That is so\nbecause, in resolving an individual’s Title VII claim, the\ncrux of the inquiry is “the reason for a particular employ\nment decision,” Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Rich\nmond, 467 U. S. 867, 876 (1984). Here respondents wish\n\n——————\n   Perhaps the most common example of considering a merits question\nat the Rule 23 stage arises in class-action suits for securities fraud.\nRule 23(b)(3)’s requirement that “questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting only individ\nual members” would often be an insuperable barrier to class certifica\ntion, since each of the individual investors would have to prove reliance\non the alleged misrepresentation. But the problem dissipates if the\nplaintiffs can establish the applicability of the so-called “fraud on the\nmarket” presumption, which says that all traders who purchase stock\nin an efficient market are presumed to have relied on the accuracy of a\ncompany’s public statements. To invoke this presumption, the plain\ntiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification must prove that their shares were\ntraded on an efficient market, Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton\nCo., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5), an issue they will surely\nhave to prove again at trial in order to make out their case on the\nmerits.\n   7 In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to “establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that . . . discrimination was the com\npany’s standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the\nunusual practice.” Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358\n(1977); see also Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 772\n(1976). If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference\nthat all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and\nwill justify “an award of prospective relief,” such as “an injunctive order\nagainst the continuation of the discriminatory practice.” Teamsters,\nsupra, at 361.\n12            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto sue about literally millions of employment decisions at\nonce. Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for\nall those decisions together, it will be impossible to say\nthat examination of all the class members’ claims for relief\nwill produce a common answer to the crucial question why\nwas I disfavored.\n                             B\n  This Court’s opinion in Falcon describes how the com\nmonality issue must be approached. There an employee\nwho claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion\non account of race obtained certification of a class compris\ning all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all\napplicants wrongfully denied jobs. 457 U. S., at 152. We\nrejected that composite class for lack of commonality and\ntypicality, explaining:\n     “Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an in\n     dividual’s claim that he has been denied a promotion\n     [or higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his\n     otherwise unsupported allegation that the company\n     has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of\n     a class of persons who have suffered the same injury\n     as that individual, such that the individual’s claim\n     and the class claim will share common questions of\n     law or fact and that the individual’s claim will be typi\n     cal of the class claims.” Id., at 157–158.\nFalcon suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap\nmight be bridged. First, if the employer “used a biased\ntesting procedure to evaluate both applicants for employ\nment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of\nevery applicant or employee who might have been preju\ndiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality\nand typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).” Id., at 159,\nn. 15. Second, “[s]ignificant proof that an employer oper\nated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncould justify a class of both applicants and employees\nif the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and pro\nmotion practices in the same general fashion, such as\nthrough entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.”\nIbid. We think that statement precisely describes respon\ndents’ burden in this case. The first manner of bridging\nthe gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has\nno testing procedure or other companywide evaluation\nmethod that can be charged with bias. The whole point of\npermitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evalu\nating employees under a common standard.\n   The second manner of bridging the gap requires “signifi\ncant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general\npolicy of discrimination.” That is entirely absent here.\nWal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination,\nsee App. 1567a–1596a, and as the District Court recog\nnized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal\nemployment opportunity, 222 F. R. D., at 154. The only\nevidence of a “general policy of discrimination” respon\ndents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby,\ntheir sociological expert. Relying on “social framework”\nanalysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a “strong\ncorporate culture,” that makes it “ ‘vulnerable’ ” to “gender\nbias.” Id., at 152. He could not, however, “determine with\nany specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaning\nful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his\ndeposition . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calcu\nlate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment\ndecisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped\nthinking.” 222 F. R. D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The\nparties dispute whether Bielby’s testimony even met the\nstandards for the admission of expert testimony under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 702 and our Daubert case,\nsee Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509\n14               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 579 (1993).8 The District Court concluded that\nDaubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certifica\ntion stage of class-action proceedings. 222 F. R. D., at 191.\nWe doubt that is so, but even if properly considered,\nBielby’s testimony does nothing to advance respondents’\ncase. “[W]hether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employ\nment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by\nstereotyped thinking” is the essential question on which\nrespondents’ theory of commonality depends. If Bielby\nadmittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely\ndisregard what he has to say. It is worlds away from\n“significant proof ” that Wal-Mart “operated under a gen\neral policy of discrimination.”\n                               C\n  The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’ evidence\nconvincingly establishes is Wal-Mart’s “policy” of allowing\ndiscretion by local supervisors over employment matters.\nOn its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform\nemployment practice that would provide the commonality\nneeded for a class action; it is a policy against having\nuniform employment practices. It is also a very common\n——————\n  8 Bielby’s conclusions in this case have elicited criticism from the very\n\nscholars on whose conclusions he relies for his social-framework analy\nsis. See Monahan, Walker, & Mitchell, Contextual Evidence of Gender\nDiscrimination: The Ascendance of “Social Frameworks,” 94 Va.\nL. Rev. 1715, 1747 (2008) (“[Bielby’s] research into conditions and be\nhavior at Wal-Mart did not meet the standards expected of social\nscientific research into stereotyping and discrimination”); id., at 1745,\n1747 (“[A] social framework necessarily contains only general state\nments about reliable patterns of relations among variables . . . and goes\nno further. . . . Dr. Bielby claimed to present a social framework, but he\ntestified about social facts specific to Wal-Mart”); id., at 1747–1748\n(“Dr. Bielby’s report provides no verifiable method for measuring and\ntesting any of the variables that were crucial to his conclusions and\nreflects nothing more than Dr. Bielby’s ‘expert judgment’ about how\ngeneral stereotyping research applied to all managers across all of Wal-\nMart’s stores nationwide for the multi-year class period”).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand presumptively reasonable way of doing business—one\nthat we have said “should itself raise no inference of dis\ncriminatory conduct,” Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust,\n487 U. S. 977, 990 (1988).\n   To be sure, we have recognized that, “in appropriate\ncases,” giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be\nthe basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact\ntheory—since “an employer’s undisciplined system of\nsubjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same\neffects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional\ndiscrimination.” Id., at 990–991. But the recognition that\nthis type of Title VII claim “can” exist does not lead to\nthe conclusion that every employee in a company using a\nsystem of discretion has such a claim in common. To the\ncontrary, left to their own devices most managers in any\ncorporation—and surely most managers in a corporation\nthat forbids sex discrimination—would select sex-neutral,\nperformance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that\nproduce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to\nreward various attributes that produce disparate impact—\nsuch as scores on general aptitude tests or educational\nachievements, see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.\n424, 431–432 (1971). And still other managers may be\nguilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex\nbased disparity. In such a company, demonstrating the\ninvalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do noth\ning to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s. A party\nseeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to\nshow that all the employees’ Title VII claims will in fact\ndepend on the answers to common questions.\n   Respondents have not identified a common mode of exer\ncising discretion that pervades the entire company—aside\nfrom their reliance on Dr. Bielby’s social frameworks analy\nsis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart’s size\nand geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all\nmanagers would exercise their discretion in a common way\n16            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout some common direction. Respondents attempt to\nmake that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal\nevidence, but their evidence falls well short.\n   The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression\nanalyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician,\nand Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. Drogin con\nducted his analysis region-by-region, comparing the num\nber of women promoted into management positions with\nthe percentage of women in the available pool of hourly\nworkers. After considering regional and national data,\nDrogin concluded that “there are statistically significant\ndisparities between men and women at Wal-Mart . . .\n[and] these disparities . . . can be explained only by gender\ndiscrimination.” 603 F. 3d, at 604 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Bendick compared work-force data from\nWal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that\nWal-Mart “promotes a lower percentage of women than its\ncompetitors.” Ibid.\n   Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are\ninsufficient to establish that respondents’ theory can be\nproved on a classwide basis. In Falcon, we held that one\nnamed plaintiff ’s experience of discrimination was insuffi\ncient to infer that “discriminatory treatment is typical of\n[the employer’s employment] practices.” 457 U. S., at 158.\nA similar failure of inference arises here. As Judge Ikuta\nobserved in her dissent, “[i]nformation about disparities at\nthe regional and national level does not establish the\nexistence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise\nthe inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination\nis implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and\ndistrict level.” 603 F. 3d, at 637. A regional pay disparity,\nfor example, may be attributable to only a small set of\nWal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uni\nform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs’\ntheory of commonality depends.\n   There is another, more fundamental, respect in which\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondents’ statistical proof fails. Even if it established\n(as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs\nfrom the nationwide figures or the regional figures in all of\nWal-Mart’s 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate\nthat commonality of issue exists. Some managers will\nclaim that the availability of women, or qualified women,\nor interested women, in their stores’ area does not mirror\nthe national or regional statistics. And almost all of them\nwill claim to have been applying some sex-neutral,\nperformance-based criteria—whose nature and effects\nwill differ from store to store. In the landmark case of\nours which held that giving discretion to lower-level su\npervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a\ndisparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion conditioned\nthat holding on the corollary that merely proving that the\ndiscretionary system has produced a racial or sexual\ndisparity is not enough. “[T]he plaintiff must begin by\nidentifying the specific employment practice that is chal\nlenged.” Watson, 487 U. S., at 994; accord, Wards Cove\nPacking Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 656 (1989) (approv\ning that statement), superseded by statute on other\ngrounds, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k). That is all the more\nnecessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certi\nfied. Other than the bare existence of delegated discre\ntion, respondents have identified no “specific employment\npractice”—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million\nclaims together. Merely showing that Wal-Mart’s policy of\ndiscretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity\ndoes not suffice.\n   Respondents’ anecdotal evidence suffers from the same\ndefects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference\nthat all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions\nare discriminatory. In Teamsters v. United States, 431\nU. S. 324 (1977), in addition to substantial statistical\nevidence of company-wide discrimination, the Government\n(as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial\n18              WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscrimination from particular individuals. See id., at\n338. That number was significant because the company\ninvolved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were\nminorities, id., at 337, and the class itself consisted of\naround 334 persons, United States v. T.I.M.E.-D. C., Inc.,\n517 F. 2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other\ngrounds, Teamsters, supra. The 40 anecdotes thus repre\nsented roughly one account for every eight members of\nthe class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the\nanecdotes came from individuals “spread throughout” the\ncompany who “for the most part” worked at the company’s\noperational centers that employed the largest numbers of\nthe class members. 517 F. 2d, at 315, and n. 30. Here, by\ncontrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting\nexperiences of discrimination—about 1 for every 12,500\nclass members—relating to only some 235 out of Wal-\nMart’s 3,400 stores. 603 F. 3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissent\ning). More than half of these reports are concentrated in\nonly six States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri,\nTexas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or\ntwo anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about\nWal-Mart’s operations at all. Id., at 634–635, and n. 10.\nEven if every single one of these accounts is true, that\nwould not demonstrate that the entire company “oper\nate[s] under a general policy of discrimination,” Falcon,\nsupra, at 159, n. 15, which is what respondents must show\nto certify a companywide class.9\n  The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing\n——————\n  9 The dissent says that we have adopted “a rule that a discrimination\nclaim, if accompanied by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers\nproportionate to the size of the class.” Post, at 5, n. 4 (GINSBURG, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not quite accurate.\nA discrimination claimant is free to supply as few anecdotes as he\nwishes. But when the claim is that a company operates under a gen\neral policy of discrimination, a few anecdotes selected from literally\nmillions of employment decisions prove nothing at all.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis. It criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities be\ntween the putative class members on the ground that\nwe have “blend[ed]” Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality require\nment with Rule 23(b)(3)’s inquiry into whether common\nquestions “predominate” over individual ones. See post, at\n8–10 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). That is not so. We quite agree that for purposes of\nRule 23(a)(2) “ ‘[e]ven a single [common] question’ ” will do,\npost, at 10, n. 9 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence\nPrinciple and the Structure of the Class Action, 103\nColum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n. 110 (2003)). We consider\ndissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3)\nrequires) whether common questions predominate, but in\norder to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether\nthere is “[e]ven a single [common] question.” And there is\nnot here. Because respondents provide no convincing\nproof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion\npolicy, we have concluded that they have not established\nthe existence of any common question.10\n  In sum, we agree with Chief Judge Kozinski that the\nmembers of the class:\n     “held a multitude of different jobs, at different levels\n     of Wal-Mart’s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time,\n     in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a ka\n     leidoscope of supervisors (male and female), subject to\n     a variety of regional policies that all differed. . . .\n     Some thrived while others did poorly. They have little\n     in common but their sex and this lawsuit.” 603 F. 3d,\n——————\n  10 For this reason, there is no force to the dissent’s attempt to distin\nguish Falcon on the ground that in that case there were “ ‘no common\nquestions of law or fact’ between the claims of the lead plaintiff and the\napplicant class ” post, at 9, n. 7 (quoting Falcon, 457 U. S., at 162\n(Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). Here also\nthere is nothing to unite all of the plaintiffs’ claims, since (contrary to\nthe dissent’s contention, post, at 9, n. 7), the same employment prac\ntices do not “touch and concern all members of the class.”\n20            WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     at 652 (dissenting opinion).\n                              III\n   We also conclude that respondents’ claims for backpay\nwere improperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b)(2). Our opinion in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v.\nBrown, 511 U. S. 117, 121 (1994) (per curiam) expressed\nserious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief\nmay be certified under that provision. We now hold that\nthey may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief\nis not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.\n                             A\n   Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole.” One possible reading of\nthis provision is that it applies only to requests for such\ninjunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the\nclass certification of monetary claims at all. We need not\nreach that broader question in this case, because we think\nthat, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like\nthe backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The\nkey to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the\ninjunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion\nthat the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared\nunlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none\nof them.” Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132. In other\nwords, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction\nor declaratory judgment would provide relief to each\nmember of the class. It does not authorize class certifica\ntion when each individual class member would be entitled\nto a different injunction or declaratory judgment against\nthe defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certi\nfication when each class member would be entitled to an\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Windsor,\n521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we\nhave previously looked to the historical models on which\nthe Rule was based, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 841–845 (1999). As we observed in Amchem, “[c]ivil\nrights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class\nbased discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is\nmeant to capture. 521 U. S., at 614. In particular, the\nRule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to\nracial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single\nclasswide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory\nCommittee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the\nplaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with\ntheir classwide injunction. See Advisory Committee’s\nNote, 39 F. R. D. 69, 102 (1966) (citing cases); e.g., Potts v.\nFlax, 313 F. 2d 284, 289, n. 5 (CA5 1963); Brunson v.\nBoard of Trustees of Univ. of School Dist. No. 1, Clarendon\nCty., 311 F. 2d 107, 109 (CA4 1962) (per curiam); Frasier\nv. Board of Trustees of N.C., 134 F. Supp. 589, 593 (NC\n1955) (three-judge court), aff’d, 350 U. S. 979 (1956).\n  Permitting the combination of individualized and class\nwide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the\nstructure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) and\n(b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class\ntreatment—that individual adjudications would be impos\nsible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,11 or that the relief\n——————\n  11 Rule 23(b)(1) applies where separate actions by or against individ\n\nual class members would create a risk of “establish[ing] incompatible\nstandards of conduct for the party opposing the class,” Rule 23(b)(1)(A),\nsuch as “where the party is obliged by law to treat the members of the\nclass alike,” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 614\n(1997), or where individual adjudications “as a practical matter, would\nbe dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the\n22               WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsought must perforce affect the entire class at once, as in a\n(b)(2) class. For that reason these are also mandatory\nclasses: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or\n(b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige\nthe District Court to afford them notice of the action. Rule\n23(b)(3), by contrast, is an “adventuresome innovation” of\nthe 1966 amendments, Amchem, 521 U. S., at 614 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted), framed for situations “in\nwhich ‘class-action treatment is not as clearly called for’,”\nid., at 615 (quoting Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28\nU. S. C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)). It allows class certifica\ntion in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater\nprocedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that “the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members pre\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and\n(b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class\nmembers are entitled to receive “the best notice that is\npracticable under the circumstances” and to withdraw\nfrom the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).\n   Given that structure, we think it clear that individ\nualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3). The\nprocedural protections attending the (b)(3) class—\npredominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the\nright to opt out—are missing from (b)(2) not because the\nRule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers\nthem unnecessary to a (b)(2) class. When a class seeks an\nindivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once,\nthere is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into\n\n——————\nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their\nability to protect their interests,” Rule 23(b)(1)(B), such as in “ ‘limited\nfund’ cases, . . . in which numerous persons make claims against a fund\ninsufficient to satisfy all claims,” Amchem, supra, at 614.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether class issues predominate or whether class action\nis a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Pre\ndominance and superiority are self-evident. But with\nrespect to each class member’s individualized claim for\nmoney, that is not so—which is precisely why (b)(3) re\nquires the judge to make findings about predominance and\nsuperiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does\nnot require that class members be given notice and opt-\nout rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or\nwrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is\nmandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue\nin this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In\nthe context of a class action predominantly for money\ndamages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out\nviolates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,\n472 U. S. 797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that\nto be so where the monetary claims do not predominate,\nthe serious possibility that it may be so provides an addi\ntional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the\nmonetary claims here.\n                               B\n   Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their\nclaims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of\na class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not\n“predominate” over their requests for injunctive and de\nclaratory relief. They rely upon the Advisory Committee’s\nstatement that Rule 23(b)(2) “does not extend to cases in\nwhich the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or\npredominantly to money damages.” 39 F. R. D., at 102\n(emphasis added). The negative implication, they argue,\nis that it does extend to cases in which the appropriate\nfinal relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to\nmoney damages. Of course it is the Rule itself, not the\nAdvisory Committee’s description of it, that governs. And\na mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to\n24           WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nestablish a disposition that has no basis in the Rule’s text,\nand that does obvious violence to the Rule’s structural\nfeatures. The mere “predominance” of a proper (b)(2)\ninjunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of Rule\n23(b)(3)’s procedural protections: It neither establishes the\nsuperiority of class adjudication over individual adjudica\ntion nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to\nsee why the Rule should be read to nullify these protec\ntions whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its\nmonetary claims with a request—even a “predominating\nrequest”—for an injunction.\n   Respondents’ predominance test, moreover, creates\nperverse incentives for class representatives to place at\nrisk potentially valid claims for monetary relief. In this\ncase, for example, the named plaintiffs declined to include\nemployees’ claims for compensatory damages in their\ncomplaint. That strategy of including only backpay claims\nmade it more likely that monetary relief would not “pre\ndominate.” But it also created the possibility (if the pre\ndominance test were correct) that individual class mem\nbers’ compensatory-damages claims would be precluded by\nlitigation they had no power to hold themselves apart\nfrom. If it were determined, for example, that a particular\nclass member is not entitled to backpay because her denial\nof increased pay or a promotion was not the product of\ndiscrimination, that employee might be collaterally es\ntopped from independently seeking compensatory dam\nages based on that same denial. That possibility under\nscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary\nclaims to decide for themselves whether to tie their fates to\nthe class representatives’ or go it alone—a choice Rule\n23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have.\n   The predominance test would also require the District\nCourt to reevaluate the roster of class members continu\nally. The Ninth Circuit recognized the necessity for this\nwhen it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby Wal-Mart lack standing to seek injunctive or declara\ntory relief against its employment practices. The Court of\nAppeals’ response to that difficulty, however, was not to\neliminate all former employees from the certified class,\nbut to eliminate only those who had left the company’s\nemploy by the date the complaint was filed. That solution\nhas no logical connection to the problem, since those who\nhave left their Wal-Mart jobs since the complaint was filed\nhave no more need for prospective relief than those who\nleft beforehand. As a consequence, even though the valid\nity of a (b)(2) class depends on whether “final injunctive\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole,” Rule 23(b)(2) (emphasis\nadded), about half the members of the class approved by\nthe Ninth Circuit have no claim for injunctive or declara\ntory relief at all. Of course, the alternative (and logical)\nsolution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave\ntheir employment may have struck the Court of Appeals\nas wasteful of the District Court’s time. Which indeed it\nis, since if a backpay action were properly certified for\nclass treatment under (b)(3), the ability to litigate a plain\ntiff ’s backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on\nthe irrelevant question whether she is still employed at\nWal-Mart. What follows from this, however, is not that\nsome arbitrary limitation on class membership should be\nimposed but that the backpay claims should not be certi\nfied under Rule 23(b)(2) at all.\n   Finally, respondents argue that their backpay claims\nare appropriate for a (b)(2) class action because a backpay\naward is equitable in nature. The latter may be true, but\nit is irrelevant. The Rule does not speak of “equitable”\nremedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory\njudgments. As Title VII itself makes pellucidly clear,\nbackpay is neither. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B)(i)\nand (ii) (distinguishing between declaratory and injunc\ntive relief and the payment of “backpay,” see §2000e–\n26             WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. DUKES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n5(g)(2)(A)).\n                              C\n   In Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F. 3d 402, 415\n(CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would\npermit the certification of monetary relief that is “inciden\ntal to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,” which it\ndefined as “damages that flow directly from liability to\nthe class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the\ninjunctive or declaratory relief.” In that court’s view, such\n“incidental damage should not require additional hearings\nto resolve the disparate merits of each individual’s case; it\nshould neither introduce new substantial legal or factual\nissues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.”\nIbid. We need not decide in this case whether there are\nany forms of “incidental” monetary relief that are consis\ntent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have\nannounced and that comply with the Due Process Clause.\nRespondents do not argue that they can satisfy this stan\ndard, and in any event they cannot.\n   Contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s view, Wal-Mart is enti\ntled to individualized determinations of each employee’s\neligibility for backpay. Title VII includes a detailed reme\ndial scheme. If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an\nemployer has discriminated against him in violation of the\nstatute, the court “may enjoin the respondent from en\ngaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order\nsuch affirmative action as may be appropriate, [including]\nreinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without\nbackpay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court\ndeems appropriate.” §2000e–5(g)(1). But if the employer\ncan show that it took an adverse employment action\nagainst an employee for any reason other than discrimina\ntion, the court cannot order the “hiring, reinstatement, or\npromotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment\nto him of any backpay.” §2000e–5(g)(2)(A).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have established a procedure for trying pattern-or\npractice cases that gives effect to these statutory require\nments. When the plaintiff seeks individual relief such as\nreinstatement or backpay after establishing a pattern or\npractice of discrimination, “a district court must usually\nconduct additional proceedings . . . to determine the scope\nof individual relief.” Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 361. At this\nphase, the burden of proof will shift to the company, but it\nwill have the right to raise any individual affirmative\ndefenses it may have, and to “demonstrate that the indi\nvidual applicant was denied an employment opportunity\nfor lawful reasons.” Id., at 362.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that it was possible to\nreplace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. A sample\nset of the class members would be selected, as to whom\nliability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a\nresult would be determined in depositions supervised by a\nmaster. The percentage of claims determined to be valid\nwould then be applied to the entire remaining class, and\nthe number of (presumptively) valid claims thus derived\nwould be multiplied by the average backpay award in the\nsample set to arrive at the entire class recovery—without\nfurther individualized proceedings. 603 F. 3d, at 625–627.\nWe disapprove that novel project. Because the Rules\nEnabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to “abridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U. S. C.\n§2072(b); see Ortiz, 527 U. S., at 845, a class cannot be\ncertified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled\nto litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims. And\nbecause the necessity of that litigation will prevent back\npay from being “incidental” to the classwide injunction,\nrespondents’ class could not be certified even assuming,\narguendo, that “incidental” monetary relief can be\nawarded to a 23(b)(2) class.\n                      *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n                                                  Reversed.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

The plaintiffs’ “largely uncontested descriptive\nstatistics” also show that women working in the company’s\nstores “are paid less than men in every region” and “that\nthe salary gap widens over time even for men and women\nhired into the same jobs at the same time.” Ibid.; cf.\nLedbetter v.

The\nselection of employees for promotion to in-store manage\nment “is fairly characterized as a ‘tap on the shoulder’\nprocess,” in which managers have discretion about whose\nshoulders to tap.

Ibid.\n  Wal-Mart’s compensation policies also operate uniformly\nacross stores, the District Court found. The retailer leaves\nopen a $2 band for every position’s hourly pay rate.

If courts must conduct a “dissimilarities” analysis\nat the Rule 23(a)(2) stage, no mission remains for Rule\n23(b)(3).\n   Because Rule 23(a) is also a prerequisite for Rule\n23(b)(1) and Rule 23(b)(2) classes, the Court’s “dissimilari\nties” position is far reaching.       Individual differences\nshould not bar a Rule 23(b)(1) or Rule 23(b)(2) class, so\nlong as the Rule 23(a) threshold is met. See Amchem\nProducts, 521 U. S., at 623, n. 19 (Rule 23(b)(1)(B) “does\nnot have a predominance requirement”); Yamasaki, 442\nU. S., at 701 (Rule 23(b)(2) action in which the Court noted\nthat “[i]t is unlikely that differences in the factual back\nground of each claim will affect the outcome of the legal\nissue”). For example, in Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,\n424 U. S. 747 (1976), a Rule 23(b)(2) class of African-\nAmerican truckdrivers complained that the defendant had\ndiscriminatorily refused to hire black applicants. We\nrecognized that the “qualification[s] and performance” of\nindividual class members might vary. Id., at 772 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Generalizations concerning\nsuch individually applicable evidence,” we cautioned,\n“cannot serve as a justification for the denial of [injunc\n\n——————\n  9 Cf.supra, at 2 (Rule 23(a) commonality prerequisite satisfied by\n“[e]ven a single question . . . common to the members of the class”\n(quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the\nClass Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n. 110 (2003)).\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

Given the lack of\nstandards for pay and promotions, the majority says,\n“demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s use of\ndiscretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of\nanother’s.” Ante, at 15.\n   Wal-Mart’s delegation of discretion over pay and promo\ntions is a policy uniform throughout all stores. The very\nnature of discretion is that people will exercise it in vari\nous ways. A system of delegated discretion, Watson held,\nis a practice actionable under Title VII when it produces\ndiscriminatory outcomes. 487 U. S., at 990–991; see su\npra, at 7–8. A finding that Wal-Mart’s pay and promo\ntions practices in fact violate the law would be the first\nstep in the usual order of proof for plaintiffs seeking indi\nvidual remedies for company-wide discrimination. Team\nsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 359 (1977); see Albe\nmarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 415–423 (1975).\nThat each individual employee’s unique circumstances will\nultimately determine whether she is entitled to backpay or\ndamages, §2000e–5(g)(2)(A) (barring backpay if a plaintiff\n“was refused . . . advancement . . . for any reason other\nthan discrimination”), should not factor into the Rule\n23(a)(2) determination.\n                       *    *    *\n  The Court errs in importing a “dissimilarities” notion\nsuited to Rule 23(b)(3) into the Rule 23(a) commonality\ninquiry.
