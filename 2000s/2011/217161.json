Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 23, 2011\nCalifornia’s prisons are designed to house a population just under\n  80,000, but at the time of the decision under review the population\n  was almost double that. The resulting conditions are the subject of\n  two federal class actions. In Coleman v. Brown, filed in 1990, the\n  District Court found that prisoners with serious mental illness do not\n  receive minimal, adequate care. A Special Master appointed to over\n  see remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental\n  health care in California’s prisons was deteriorating due to increased\n  overcrowding. In Plata v. Brown, filed in 2001, the State conceded\n  that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth\n  Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction. But\n  when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the\n  court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts. Three years\n  later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by over\n  crowding. Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and\n  mental health care could not be achieved without reducing over\n  crowding, the Coleman and Plata plaintiffs moved their respective\n  District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the\n  Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in\n  the prison population. The judges in both actions granted the re\n  quest, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge\n  court. After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact,\n  the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5%\n  of design capacity within two years. Finding that the prison popula\n  tion would have to be reduced if capacity could not be increased\n  through new construction, the court ordered the State to formulate a\n  compliance plan and submit it for court approval.\n2                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. The court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the\n violation of prisoners’ constitutional rights and is authorized by the\n PLRA. Pp. 12–41.\n       (a) If a prison deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including\n adequate medical care, the courts have a responsibility to remedy the\n resulting Eighth Amendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437\n U. S. 678, 687, n. 9. They must consider a range of options, including\n the appointment of special masters or receivers, the possibility of\n consent decrees, and orders limiting a prison’s population. Under the\n PLRA, only a three-judge court may limit a prison population. 18\n U. S. C. §3626(a)(3). Before convening such a court, a district court\n must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that failed to\n remedy the constitutional violation and must have given the defen\n dant a reasonable time to comply with its prior orders.\n §3626(a)(3)(A). Once convened, the three-judge court must find by\n clear and convincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of\n the violation” and “no other relief will remedy [the] violation,”\n §3626(a)(3)(E); and that the relief is “narrowly drawn, extends no fur\n ther than necessary. . . , and is the least intrusive means necessary to\n correct the violation,” §3626(a)(1)(A). The court must give “substan\n tial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of\n a criminal justice system caused by the relief.” Ibid. Its legal deter\n minations are reviewed de novo, but its factual findings are reviewed\n for clear error. Pp. 12–15.\n       (b) The Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably in convening\n a three-judge court. Pp. 15–19.\n         (1) The merits of the decision to convene are properly before\n this Court, which has exercised its 28 U. S. C. §1253 jurisdiction to\n determine the authority of a court below, including whether a three\n judge court was properly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employ\n ees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12. Pp. 15–16.\n         (2) Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)’s previous order requirement was\n satisfied in Coleman by the Special Master’s 1995 appointment and\n in Plata by the 2002 approval of a consent decree and stipulated in\n junction. Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional viola\n tions and were given ample time to succeed—12 years in Coleman,\n and 5 years in Plata.               Contrary to the State’s claim,\n §3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)’s reasonable time requirement did not require the\n District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to\n succeed. Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a\n moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit,\n which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts’ involve\n ment, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners. The Coleman\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nand Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to\nbuild new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given\nthe ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master\nand the Receiver. Pp. 16–19.\n     (c) The three-judge court did not err in finding that “crowding\n[was] the primary cause of the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(i). Pp. 19–\n29.\n        (1) The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning\ndemand on the provision of care. The evidence showed that there\nwere high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, e.g.,\n20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers\nunderstated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budg\neted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions\ncould be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional\nstaff. Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating\nmentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation\nfor extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health\ntreatment beds. There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners wait\ning to see a doctor for physical care. Crowding creates unsafe and\nunsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and\nmental health care. It also promotes unrest and violence and can\ncause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop\novert symptoms. Increased violence requires increased reliance on\nlockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective\ndelivery of care. Overcrowding’s effects are particularly acute in\nprison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning\nprisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire\nincarceration period. Numerous experts testified that crowding is the\nprimary cause of the constitutional violations. Pp. 19–24.\n        (2) Contrary to the State’s claim, the three-judge court prop\nerly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison condi\ntions as relevant to the issues before it. Expert witnesses based their\nconclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad\nmitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Spe\ncial Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current\nconditions. The court’s orders cutting off discovery a few months be\nfore trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a\npopulation limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the\ncourt’s sound discretion. Orderly trial management may require dis\ncovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the\nmerits and the remedy. The State points to no significant evidence\nthat it was unable to present and that would have changed the out\ncome here. Pp. 24–26.\n        (3) It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that\n4                            BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    overcrowding was the “primary,” but not the only, cause of the viola\n    tions, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the viola\n    tions. This understanding of the primary cause requirement is con\n    sistent with the PLRA. Had Congress intended to require that\n    crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so. Pp. 26–29.\n         (d) The evidence supports the three-judge court’s finding that “no\n    other relief [would] remedy the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii). The\n    State’s claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive al\n    ternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers\n    is a population limit under the PLRA. Even if they could be regarded\n    as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evi\n    dence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve over\n    crowding. The court also found no realistic possibility that California\n    could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the State’s ongo\n    ing fiscal problems. Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realis\n    tic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed\n    and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.\n    The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population\n    reduction, the Receiver’s and Special Master’s continued efforts\n    would not achieve a remedy. Their reports are persuasive evidence\n    that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and\n    would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State. The\n    State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a\n    long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evi\n    dence of overcrowding’s deleterious effects on the provision of care,\n    compels a different conclusion here. Pp. 29–33.\n         (e) The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, ex\n    tended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the\n    least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation. Pp. 33–41.\n           (1) The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply\n    because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released\n    through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required re\n    duction. While narrow tailoring requires a “ ‘ “fit” between the [rem\n    edy’s] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,’ ” Board\n    of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480, a narrow\n    and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not in\n    valid simply because it will have collateral effects. Nor does the\n    PLRA require that result. The order gives the State flexibility to de\n    termine who should be released, and the State could move the three\n    judge court to modify its terms. The order also is not overbroad be\n    cause it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than sepa\n    rately assessing each institution’s need for a population limit. The\n    Coleman court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated\n    to systemwide relief in Plata. Assuming no constitutional violation\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nresults, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5%\nlimit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a\nwhole remains in compliance with the order. This will afford the\nState flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.\nThe order may shape or control the State’s authority in the realm of\nprison administration, but it leaves much to the State’s discretion.\nThe order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional vio\nlation. The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order,\nbut it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.\nPp. 33–36.\n        (2) The three-judge court gave “substantial weight” to any po\ntential adverse impact on public safety from its order. The PLRA’s\n“substantial weight” requirement does not require the court to certify\nthat its order has no possible adverse impact on the public. Here,\nstatistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered\nwithout adversely affecting public safety in some California counties,\nseveral States, and Canada. The court found that various available\nmethods of reducing overcrowding—good time credits and diverting\nlow-risk offenders to community programs—would have little or no\nimpact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns\nby giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means\nof reducing overcrowding. The State complains that the court ap\nproved the State’s population reduction plan without considering\nwhether its specific measures would substantially threaten public\nsafety. But the court left state officials the choice of how best to com\nply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.\nDevelopments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State\nhas begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion\nthat a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative ef\nfect on public safety. Pp. 37–41.\n   2. The three-judge court’s order, subject to the State’s right to seek\nits modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.\nPp. 41–48.\n      (a) To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit\nat the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it\nmust order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest\nperiod of time reasonably consistent with public safety. Pp. 41–42.\n      (b) The three-judge court’s conclusion that the prison population\nshould be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly errone\nous. The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit be\ntween the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State\nCorrections Independent Review Panel. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring\nrequirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judg\n6                            BROWN v.

Pp. 42–44.\n         (c) The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year dead\n    line for relief, especially in light of the State’s failure to contest the\n    issue at trial. The State has not asked this Court to extend the dead\n    line, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility,\n    to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.\n    Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes re\n    quire that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State consid\n    erable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will\n    promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public\n    safety. The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if\n    the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that\n    the plan will be implemented without undue delay. Such observa\n    tions reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable\n    relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not in\n    tended to cast doubt on the validity of the order’s basic premise.\n    Pp. 44–48.\nAffirmed.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which GINSBURG,\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

The violations have persisted\nfor years. They remain uncorrected. The appeal comes to\nthis Court from a three-judge District Court order direct\ning California to remedy two ongoing violations of the\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a guarantee\nbinding on the States by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The violations are the subject of\ntwo class actions in two Federal District Courts. The first\ninvolves the class of prisoners with serious mental disor\nders. That case is Coleman v. Brown. The second involves\nprisoners with serious medical conditions. That case is\nPlata v. Brown. The order of the three-judge District\nCourt is applicable to both cases.\n   After years of litigation, it became apparent that a\nremedy for the constitutional violations would not be ef\nfective absent a reduction in the prison system popula\ntion. The authority to order release of prisoners as a\nremedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amend\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court,\nnot a single-judge district court. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). In\naccordance with that rule, the Coleman and Plata District\nJudges independently requested that a three-judge court\nbe convened. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit convened a three-judge court composed\nof the Coleman and Plata District Judges and a third,\nNinth Circuit Judge. Because the two cases are interre\nlated, their limited consolidation for this purpose has a\ncertain utility in avoiding conflicting decrees and aiding\njudicial consideration and enforcement. The State in this\nCourt has not objected to consolidation, although the State\ndoes argue that the three-judge court was prematurely\nconvened. The State also objects to the substance of the\nthree-judge court order, which requires the State to reduce\novercrowding in its prisons.\n   The appeal presents the question whether the remedial\norder issued by the three-judge court is consistent with\nrequirements and procedures set forth in a congressional\nstatute, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA).\n18 U. S. C. §3626; see Appendix A, infra. The order leaves\nthe choice of means to reduce overcrowding to the discre\ntion of state officials. But absent compliance through new\nconstruction, out-of-state transfers, or other means—or\nmodification of the order upon a further showing by the\nState—the State will be required to release some number\nof prisoners before their full sentences have been served.\nHigh recidivism rates must serve as a warning that mis\ntaken or premature release of even one prisoner can cause\ninjury and harm. The release of prisoners in large num\nbers—assuming the State finds no other way to comply\nwith the order—is a matter of undoubted, grave concern.\n   At the time of trial, California’s correctional facilities\nheld some 156,000 persons. This is nearly double the\nnumber that California’s prisons were designed to hold,\nand California has been ordered to reduce its prison popu\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlation to 137.5% of design capacity. By the three-judge\ncourt’s own estimate, the required population reduction\ncould be as high as 46,000 persons. Although the State\nhas reduced the population by at least 9,000 persons dur\ning the pendency of this appeal, this means a further\nreduction of 37,000 persons could be required. As will be\nnoted, the reduction need not be accomplished in an indis\ncriminate manner or in these substantial numbers if sat\nisfactory, alternate remedies or means for compliance\nare devised. The State may employ measures, including\ngood-time credits and diversion of low-risk offenders and\ntechnical parole violators to community-based programs,\nthat will mitigate the order’s impact. The population\nreduction potentially required is nevertheless of unprece\ndented sweep and extent.\n   Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting\nfrom these serious constitutional violations. For years the\nmedical and mental health care provided by California’s\nprisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional re\nquirements and has failed to meet prisoners’ basic health\nneeds. Needless suffering and death have been the well\ndocumented result. Over the whole course of years during\nwhich this litigation has been pending, no other remedies\nhave been found to be sufficient. Efforts to remedy the\nviolation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in\nCalifornia’s prison system. Short term gains in the provi\nsion of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of\nsevere and pervasive overcrowding.\n   Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of\nprison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity\nof medical and mental health facilities; and created unsan\nitary and unsafe conditions that make progress in the\nprovision of care difficult or impossible to achieve. The\novercrowding is the “primary cause of the violation of a\nFederal right,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically\nthe severe and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners\n4                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough grossly inadequate provision of medical and\nmental health care.\n   This Court now holds that the PLRA does authorize the\nrelief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated\npopulation limit is necessary to remedy the violation of\nprisoners’ constitutional rights. The order of the three\njudge court, subject to the right of the State to seek\nits modification in appropriate circumstances, must be\naffirmed.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The degree of overcrowding in California’s prisons is\nexceptional. California’s prisons are designed to house a\npopulation just under 80,000, but at the time of the three\njudge court’s decision the population was almost double\nthat. The State’s prisons had operated at around 200% of\ndesign capacity for at least 11 years. Prisoners are\ncrammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to\nhouse inmates. As many as 200 prisoners may live in a\ngymnasium, monitored by as few as two or three correc\ntional officers. App. 1337–1338, 1350; see Appendix B,\ninfra. As many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.\nApp. 1337.\n   The Corrections Independent Review Panel, a body\nappointed by the Governor and composed of correctional\nconsultants and representatives from state agencies,\nconcluded that California’s prisons are “ ‘severely over\ncrowded, imperiling the safety of both correctional em\nployees and inmates.’ ”1 Juris.

T. 2009,\n——————\n   1 A similar conclusion was reached by the Little Hoover Commission,\n\na bipartisan and independent state body, which stated that\n“[o]vercrowded conditions inside the prison walls are unsafe for inmates\nand staff,” Solving California’s Corrections Crisis: Time is Running Out\n17 (Jan. 2007), and that “California’s correctional system is in a tail\nspin,” id., at i.\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Because of a shortage\nof treatment beds, suicidal inmates may be held for pro\nlonged periods in telephone-booth sized cages without\ntoilets. See Appendix C, infra.

Jeanne Woodford, who recently adminis\ntered California’s prison system, stated that “ ‘[o]vercrowding in the\n[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)] is\nextreme, its effects are pervasive and it is preventing the Department\nfrom providing adequate mental and medical health care to prisoners.’ ”\nJuris. App. 84a. Matthew Cate, the head of the California prison\nsystem, stated that “ ‘overpopulation makes everything we do more\ndifficult.’ ” Ibid. And Robin Dezember, chief deputy secretary of Cor\nrectional Healthcare Services, stated that “we are terribly overcrowded\nin our prison system” and “overcrowding has negative effects on every\nbody in the prison system.” Tr. 853, 856.\n   Experts from outside California offered similar assessments. Doyle\nWayne Scott, the former head of corrections in Texas, described con\nditions in California’s prisons as “appalling,” “inhumane,” and “unac\nceptable” and stated that “[i]n more than 35 years of prison work\nexperience, I have never seen anything like it.” App. 1337. Joseph\nLehman, the former head of correctional systems in Washington,\nMaine, and Pennsylvania, concluded that “[t]here is no question that\nCalifornia’s prisons are overcrowded” and that “this is an emergency\nsituation; it calls for drastic and immediate action.” Id., at 1312.\n6                          BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nOther inmates awaiting care may be held for months in\nadministrative segregation, where they endure harsh and\nisolated conditions and receive only limited mental health\nservices. Wait times for mental health care range as high\nas 12 months. Id., at 704. In 2006, the suicide rate\nin California’s prisons was nearly 80% higher than the\nnational average for prison populations; and a court\nappointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides\ninvolved “some measure of inadequate assessment, treat\nment, or intervention, and were therefore most probably\nforeseeable and/or preventable.”2 Id., at 1781.\n  Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive\nseverely deficient care. California’s prisons were designed\nto meet the medical needs of a population at 100% of\ndesign capacity and so have only half the clinical space\nneeded to treat the current population. Id., at 1024. A\ncorrectional officer testified that, in one prison, up to 50\nsick inmates may be held together in a 12- by 20-foot cage\nfor up to five hours awaiting treatment. Tr. 597–599. The\nnumber of staff is inadequate, and prisoners face signifi\ncant delays in access to care.

The Special Master later\nissued an analysis for the year 2007. This report concluded that the\n2007 suicide rate was “a continuation of the CDCR’s pattern of exceed\ning the national prison suicide rate.” Record in No. 2:90–CV–00520–\nLKK–JFM (ED/ND Cal.), Doc. 3677, p. 1. The report found that the\nrate of suicides involving inadequate assessment, treatment, or inter\nvention had risen to 82% and concluded that “[t]hese numbers clearly\nindicate no improvement in this area during the past several years, and\npossibly signal a trend of ongoing deterioration.” Id., at 12. No de\ntailed study has been filed since then, but in September 2010 the\nSpecial Master filed a report stating that “the data for 2010 so far is not\nshowing improvement in suicide prevention.” App. 868.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Plaintiffs rely on systemwide deficiencies in the\nprovision of medical and mental health care that, taken as a whole,\nsubject sick and mentally ill prisoners in California to “substantial risk\nof serious harm” and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall\nbelow the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.

California Prison Health Care\nReceivership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2007 Death Reviews 18\n(Nov. 2008). This was essentially unchanged from 2006, when an\nanalysis found 66 preventable or possibly preventable deaths. Ibid.\nThese statistics mean that, during 2006 and 2007, a preventable or\npossibly preventable death occurred once every five to six days.\n   Both preventable and possibly preventable deaths involve major\nlapses in medical care and are a serious cause for concern. In one\ntypical case classified as a possibly preventable death, an analysis\nrevealed the following lapses: “16 month delay in evaluating abnormal\nliver mass; 8 month delay in receiving regular chemotherapy . . . ;\nmultiple providers fail to respond to jaundice and abnormal liver\nfunction tests causing 17 month delay in diagnosis.” California Prison\nHealth Care Receivership Corp., K.

Brown, was filed in\n1990. Coleman involves the class of seriously mentally ill\npersons in California prisons. Over 15 years ago, in 1995,\nafter a 39-day trial, the Coleman District Court found\n“overwhelming evidence of the systematic failure to de\nliver necessary care to mentally ill inmates” in California\nprisons. Coleman v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1986241\"><a href=\"/opinion/1986241/coleman-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The prisons were “seriously and chronically under\nstaffed,” id., at 1306, and had “no effective method for\nensuring . . . the competence of their staff,” id., at 1308.\nThe prisons had failed to implement necessary suicide\nprevention procedures, “due in large measure to the severe\nunderstaffing.” Id., at 1315. Mentally ill inmates “lan\nguished for months, or even years, without access to nec\nessary care.” Id., at 1316. “They suffer from severe hallu\ncinations, [and] they decompensate into catatonic states.”\nIbid.

The three-judge court could not have\nanticipated this development, and it would be inappropriate for this\nCourt to evaluate its significance for the first time on appeal. The\nthree-judge court should, of course, consider this and any other evi\ndence of improved conditions when considering future requests by the\nState for modification of its order. See infra, at 45–48.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMaster in Coleman filed a report stating that, after years\nof slow improvement, the state of mental health care\nin California’s prisons was deteriorating. App. 489. The\nSpecial Master ascribed this change to increased over\ncrowding. The rise in population had led to greater\ndemand for care, and existing programming space and\nstaffing levels were inadequate to keep pace. Prisons had\nretained more mental health staff, but the “growth of the\nresource [had] not matched the rise in demand.” Id., at\n482. At the very time the need for space was rising, the\nneed to house the expanding population had also caused a\n“reduction of programming space now occupied by inmate\nbunks.” Id., at 479. The State was “facing a four to five\nyear gap in the availability of sufficient beds to meet the\ntreatment needs of many inmates/patients.” Id., at 481.\n“[I]ncreasing numbers of truly psychotic inmate/patients\nare trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot meet\ntheir needs.” Ibid. The Special Master concluded that\nmany early “achievements have succumbed to the inexo\nrably rising tide of population, leaving behind growing\nfrustration and despair.” Id., at 489.\n                             C\n   The second action, Plata v. Brown, involves the class of\nstate prisoners with serious medical conditions. After this\naction commenced in 2001, the State conceded that defi\nciencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth\nAmendment rights. The State stipulated to a remedial\ninjunction. The State failed to comply with that injunc\ntion, and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee\nremedial efforts. The court found that “the California\nprison medical care system is broken beyond repair,”\nresulting in an “unconscionable degree of suffering and\ndeath.” App. 917. The court found: “[I]t is an uncontested\nfact that, on average, an inmate in one of California’s\nprisons needlessly dies every six to seven days due to\n10                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional deficiencies in the [California prisons’]\nmedical delivery system.” Ibid. And the court made\nfindings regarding specific instances of neglect, including\nthe following:\n     “[A] San Quentin prisoner with hypertension, diabetes\n     and renal failure was prescribed two different medica\n     tions that actually served to exacerbate his renal fail\n     ure. An optometrist noted the patient’s retinal bleed\n     ing due to very high blood pressure and referred him\n     for immediate evaluation, but this evaluation never\n     took place. It was not until a year later that the pa\n     tient’s renal failure was recognized, at which point he\n     was referred to a nephrologist on an urgent basis;\n     he should have been seen by the specialist within 14\n     days but the consultation never happened and the pa\n     tient died three months later.” Id., at 928 (citations\n     omitted).\nPrisons were unable to retain sufficient numbers of com\npetent medical staff, id., at 937, and would “hire any\ndoctor who had ‘a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,’ ” id.,\nat 926. Medical facilities lacked “necessary medical equip\nment” and did “not meet basic sanitation standards.” Id.,\nat 944. “Exam tables and counter tops, where prisoners\nwith . . . communicable diseases are treated, [were] not\nroutinely disinfected.” Ibid.\n  In 2008, three years after the District Court’s decision,\nthe Receiver described continuing deficiencies in the\nhealth care provided by California prisons:\n     “Timely access is not assured. The number of medical\n     personnel has been inadequate, and competence has\n     not been assured. . . . Adequate housing for the dis\n     abled and aged does not exist. The medical facilities,\n     when they exist at all, are in an abysmal state of dis\n     repair. Basic medical equipment is often not available\n     or used.

Indeed, it is\n    a misnomer to call the existing chaos a ‘medical deliv\n    ery system’—it is more an act of desperation than a\n    system.” Record in No. 3:01–CV–01351–TEH (ND\n    Cal.), Doc. 1136, p. 5.\nA report by the Receiver detailed the impact of overcrowd\ning on efforts to remedy the violation. The Receiver ex\nplained that “overcrowding, combined with staffing short\nages, has created a culture of cynicism, fear, and despair\nwhich makes hiring and retaining competent clinicians\nextremely difficult.” App. 1031. “[O]vercrowding, and the\nresulting day to day operational chaos of the [prison sys\ntem], creates regular ‘crisis’ situations which . . . take time\n[and] energy . . . away from important remedial pro\ngrams.” Id., at 1035. Overcrowding had increased the\nincidence of infectious disease, id., at 1037–1038, and had\nled to rising prison violence and greater reliance by custo\ndial staff on lockdowns, which “inhibit the delivery of\nmedical care and increase the staffing necessary for such\ncare.” Id., at 1037. “Every day,” the Receiver reported,\n“California prison wardens and health care managers\nmake the difficult decision as to which of the class actions,\nColeman . . . or Plata they will fail to comply with because\nof staff shortages and patient loads.” Id., at 1038.\n                             D\n   The Coleman and Plata plaintiffs, believing that a rem\nedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care\ncould not be achieved without reducing overcrowding,\nmoved their respective District Courts to convene a three\njudge court empowered under the PLRA to order reduc\ntions in the prison population. The judges in both actions\ngranted the request, and the cases were consolidated\nbefore a single three-judge court. The State has not chal\nlenged the validity of the consolidation in proceedings\nbefore this Court, so its propriety is not presented by this\n12                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappeal.\n   The three-judge court heard 14 days of testimony and\nissued a 184-page opinion, making extensive findings of\nfact. The court ordered California to reduce its prison\npopulation to 137.5% of the prisons’ design capacity within\ntwo years. Assuming the State does not increase capacity\nthrough new construction, the order requires a population\nreduction of 38,000 to 46,000 persons. Because it appears\nall but certain that the State cannot complete sufficient\nconstruction to comply fully with the order, the prison\npopulation will have to be reduced to at least some extent.\nThe court did not order the State to achieve this reduction\nin any particular manner. Instead, the court ordered the\nState to formulate a plan for compliance and submit its\nplan for approval by the court.\n   The State appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n§1253, and the Court postponed consideration of the ques\ntion of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. Schwar\nzenegger v. Plata, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners may be\ndeprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet the\nlaw and the Constitution demand recognition of certain\nother rights. Prisoners retain the essence of human dig\nnity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity\nanimates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishment. “ ‘The basic concept underlying\nthe Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of\nman.’ ” Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002) (quot\ning Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality\nopinion)).\n  To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means\nto provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent\non the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care.\nA prison’s failure to provide sustenance for inmates “may\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactually produce physical ‘torture or a lingering death.’ ”\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re\nKemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A.\nElsner, Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\n(2004). Just as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she\nmay suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care. A\nprison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, includ\ning adequate medical care, is incompatible with the con\ncept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.\n   If government fails to fulfill this obligation, the courts\nhave a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth\nAmendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,\n687, n. 9 (1978). Courts must be sensitive to the State’s\ninterest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as\nwell as the need for deference to experienced and expert\nprison administrators faced with the difficult and danger\nous task of housing large numbers of convicted criminals.\nSee Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547–548 (1979). Courts\nnevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to “en\nforce the constitutional rights of all ‘persons,’ including\nprisoners.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 321 (1972) (per\ncuriam). Courts may not allow constitutional violations to\ncontinue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion\ninto the realm of prison administration.\n   Courts faced with the sensitive task of remedying un\nconstitutional prison conditions must consider a range of\navailable options, including appointment of special mas\nters or receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.\nWhen necessary to ensure compliance with a constitu\ntional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on\na prison’s population. By its terms, the PLRA restricts the\ncircumstances in which a court may enter an order “that\nhas the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison\npopulation.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(g)(4). The order in this\ncase does not necessarily require the State to release any\nprisoners. The State may comply by raising the design\n14                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncapacity of its prisons or by transferring prisoners to\ncounty facilities or facilities in other States. Because the\norder limits the prison population as a percentage of de\nsign capacity, it nonetheless has the “effect of reducing or\nlimiting the prison population.” Ibid.\n   Under the PLRA, only a three-judge court may enter an\norder limiting a prison population. §3626(a)(3)(B). Before\na three-judge court may be convened, a district court first\nmust have entered an order for less intrusive relief that\nfailed to remedy the constitutional violation and must\nhave given the defendant a reasonable time to comply\nwith its prior orders. §3626(a)(3)(A). The party request\ning a three-judge court must then submit “materials suffi\ncient to demonstrate that [these requirements] have been\nmet.” §3626(a)(3)(C). If the district court concludes that\nthe materials are, in fact, sufficient, a three-judge court\nmay be convened. Ibid.; see also 28 U. S. C. §2284(b)(1)\n(stating that a three-judge court may not be convened if\nthe district court “determines that three judges are not\nrequired”); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & V.\nAmar, Federal Practice and Procedure §4235 (3d ed. 2007).\n   The three-judge court must then find by clear and con\nvincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of\nthe violation of a Federal right” and that “no other relief\nwill remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(E). As with any award of prospective relief\nunder the PLRA, the relief “shall extend no further than\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of\na particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” §3626(a)(1)(A). The\nthree-judge court must therefore find that the relief is\n“narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary . . . ,\nand is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right.” Ibid. In making this de\ntermination, the three-judge court must give “substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the op\neration of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.”\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. Applying these standards, the three-judge court\nfound a population limit appropriate, necessary, and\nauthorized in this case.\n   This Court’s review of the three-judge court’s legal\ndeterminations is de novo, but factual findings are re\nviewed for clear error. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470\nU. S. 564, 573–574 (1985). Deference to trial court fact\nfinding reflects an understanding that “[t]he trial judge’s\nmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experi\nence in fulfilling that role comes expertise.” Id., at 574.\nThe three-judge court oversaw two weeks of trial and\nheard at considerable length from California prison offi\ncials, as well as experts in the field of correctional admini\nstration. The judges had the opportunity to ask relevant\nquestions of those witnesses. Two of the judges had over\nseen the ongoing remedial efforts of the Receiver and\nSpecial Master. The three-judge court was well situated\nto make the difficult factual judgments necessary to fash\nion a remedy for this complex and intractable constitu\ntional violation. The three-judge court’s findings of fact\nmay be reversed only if this Court is left with a “ ‘definite\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’ ”\nId., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum\nCo., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)).\n                             A\n  The State contends that it was error to convene the\nthree-judge court without affording it more time to comply\nwith the prior orders in Coleman and Plata.\n                              1\n   The parties dispute this Court’s jurisdiction to review\nthe determinations of the Coleman and Plata District\nCourts that a three-judge court should be convened.\nPlaintiffs claim the State was required to raise this issue\nfirst in the Court of Appeals by appealing the orders of the\n16                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Courts. When exercising jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. §1253, however, this Court “has not hesitated to\nexercise jurisdiction ‘to determine the authority of the\ncourt below,’ ” including whether the three-judge court was\nproperly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees\nCredit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12 (1974) (quoting Bailey\nv. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 34 (1962) (per curiam)); see also\nGully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., 292 U. S. 16, 18 (1934)\n(per curiam) (“The case is analogous to those in which this\nCourt, finding that the court below has acted without\njurisdiction, exercises its appellate jurisdiction to correct\nthe improper action”). The merits of the decision to con\nvene the three-judge court, therefore, are properly before\nthis Court.\n                               2\n   Before a three-judge court may be convened to consider\nwhether to enter a population limit, the PLRA requires\nthat the court have “previously entered an order for less\nintrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation\nof the Federal right sought to be remedied.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(i). This provision refers to “an order.” It\nis satisfied if the court has entered one order, and this sin\ngle order has “failed to remedy” the constitutional viola\ntion. The defendant must also have had “a reasonable\namount of time to comply with the previous court orders.”\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision refers to the court’s\n“orders.” It requires that the defendant have been given a\nreasonable time to comply with all of the court’s orders.\nTogether, these requirements ensure that the “ ‘last resort\nremedy’ ” of a population limit is not imposed “ ‘as a first\nstep.’ ” Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F. 2d 828, 843\n(CADC 1988).\n   The first of these conditions, the previous order re\nquirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(i), was satisfied in Coleman\nby appointment of a Special Master in 1995, and it was\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)         17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfied in Plata by approval of a consent decree and\nstipulated injunction in 2002. Both orders were intended\nto remedy the constitutional violations. Both were given\nample time to succeed. When the three-judge court was\nconvened, 12 years had passed since the appointment of\nthe Coleman Special Master, and 5 years had passed since\nthe approval of the Plata consent decree. The State does\nnot claim that either order achieved a remedy. Although\nthe PLRA entitles a State to terminate remedial orders\nsuch as these after two years unless the district court\nfinds that the relief “remains necessary to correct a\ncurrent and ongoing violation of the Federal right,”\n§3626(b)(3), California has not attempted to obtain relief\non this basis.\n   The State claims instead that the second condition, the\nreasonable time requirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(ii), was not\nmet because other, later remedial efforts should have been\ngiven more time to succeed. In 2006, the Coleman District\nJudge approved a revised plan of action calling for con\nstruction of new facilities, hiring of new staff, and im\nplementation of new procedures. That same year, the\nPlata District Judge selected and appointed a Receiver to\noversee the State’s ongoing remedial efforts. When the\nthree-judge court was convened, the Receiver had filed a\npreliminary plan of action calling for new construction,\nhiring of additional staff, and other procedural reforms.\n   Although both the revised plan of action in Coleman and\nthe appointment of the Receiver in Plata were new devel\nopments in the courts’ remedial efforts, the basic plan to\nsolve the crisis through construction, hiring, and proce\ndural reforms remained unchanged. These efforts had\nbeen ongoing for years; the failed consent decree in Plata\nhad called for implementation of new procedures and\nhiring of additional staff; and the Coleman Special Master\nhad issued over 70 orders directed at achieving a remedy\nthrough construction, hiring, and procedural reforms. The\n18                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nColeman Special Master and Plata Receiver were unable\nto provide assurance that further, substantially similar\nefforts would yield success absent a population reduction.\nInstead, the Coleman Special Master explained that\n“many of the clinical advances . . . painfully accomplished\nover the past decade are slip-sliding away” as a result of\novercrowding. App. 481–482. And the Plata Receiver\nindicated that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, a\nsuccessful remedial effort could “all but bankrupt” the\nState of California. App. 1053.\n  Having engaged in remedial efforts for 5 years in Plata\nand 12 in Coleman, the District Courts were not required\nto wait to see whether their more recent efforts would\nyield equal disappointment. When a court attempts to\nremedy an entrenched constitutional violation through\nreform of a complex institution, such as this statewide\nprison system, it may be necessary in the ordinary course\nto issue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing\nremedial efforts. Each new order must be given a reason\nable time to succeed, but reasonableness must be assessed\nin light of the entire history of the court’s remedial efforts.\nA contrary reading of the reasonable time requirement\nwould in effect require district courts to impose a morato\nrium on new remedial orders before issuing a population\nlimit. This unnecessary period of inaction would delay an\neventual remedy and would prolong the courts’ involve\nment, serving neither the State nor the prisoners. Con\ngress did not require this unreasonable result when it\nused the term “reasonable.”\n  The Coleman and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt\nthat additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new\nstaff would achieve a remedy. Indeed, although 5 years\nhave now passed since the appointment of the Plata\nReceiver and approval of the revised plan of action in\nColeman, there is no indication that the constitutional\nviolations have been cured. A report filed by the Coleman\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSpecial Master in July 2009 describes ongoing violations,\nincluding an “absence of timely access to appropriate\nlevels of care at every point in the system.” App. 807. A\nreport filed by the Plata Receiver in October 2010 likewise\ndescribes ongoing deficiencies in the provision of medical\ncare and concludes that there are simply “too many pris\noners for the healthcare infrastructure.” Id., at 1655. The\nColeman and Plata courts acted reasonably when they\nconvened a three-judge court without further delay.\n                             B\n   Once a three-judge court has been convened, the court\nmust find additional requirements satisfied before it may\nimpose a population limit. The first of these requirements\nis that “crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a\nFederal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i).\n                              1\n   The three-judge court found the primary cause require\nment satisfied by the evidence at trial. The court found\nthat overcrowding strains inadequate medical and mental\nhealth facilities; overburdens limited clinical and custodial\nstaff; and creates violent, unsanitary, and chaotic condi\ntions that contribute to the constitutional violations and\nfrustrate efforts to fashion a remedy. The three-judge\ncourt also found that “until the problem of overcrowding is\novercome it will be impossible to provide constitutionally\ncompliant care to California’s prison population.” Juris.\nApp. 141a.\n   The parties dispute the standard of review applicable to\nthis determination. With respect to the three-judge court’s\nfactual findings, this Court’s review is necessarily deferen\ntial. It is not this Court’s place to “duplicate the role” of\nthe trial court. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 573. The ultimate\nissue of primary cause presents a mixed question of law\nand fact; but there, too, “the mix weighs heavily on the\n20                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n‘fact’ side.” Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 148 (1999)\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Because the\n“district court is ‘better positioned’ . . . to decide the issue,”\nour review of the three-judge court’s primary cause deter\nmination is deferential. Salve Regina College v. Russell,\n499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991).\n   The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning\ndemand on the provision of care. At the time of trial,\nvacancy rates for medical and mental health staff ranged\nas high as 20% for surgeons, 25% for physicians, 39% for\nnurse practitioners, and 54.1% for psychiatrists. Juris.\nApp. 105a, 108a. These percentages are based on the\nnumber of positions budgeted by the State. Dr. Ronald\nShansky, former medical director of the Illinois prison\nsystem, concluded that these numbers understate the se\nverity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted\nsufficient staff to meet demand.5              According to Dr.\nShansky, “even if the prisons were able to fill all of their\nvacant health care positions, which they have not been\nable to do to date, . . . the prisons would still be unable to\nhandle the level of need given the current overcrowding.”\nRecord in No. 2:90–CV–00520–LKK–JFM (ED Cal.), Doc.\n3231–13, p. 16 (hereinafter Doc. 3231–13). Dr. Craig\nHaney, a professor of psychology, reported that mental\nhealth staff are “managing far larger caseloads than is\nappropriate or effective.” App. 596. A prison psychiatrist\ntold Dr. Haney that “ ‘we are doing about 50% of what we\nshould be doing.’ ” Ibid. In the context of physical care Dr.\nShansky agreed that “demand for care, particularly for the\nhigh priority cases, continues to overwhelm the resources\n——————\n  5 Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had “significantly\n\nunderestimated the staffing needed to implement critical portions of the\nColeman Program Guide requirements,” that “key tasks were omitted\nwhen determining staffing workloads,” and that estimates were based\non “key assumptions” that caused the State to underestimate demand\nfor mental health care. App. 596–597.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\navailable.” Id., at 1408.\n    Even on the assumption that vacant positions could be\nfilled, the evidence suggested there would be insufficient\nspace for the necessary additional staff to perform their\njobs. The Plata Receiver, in his report on overcrowding,\nconcluded that even the “newest and most modern pris\nons” had been “designed with clinic space which is only\none-half that necessary for the real-life capacity of the\nprisons.” App. 1023 (emphasis deleted). Dr. Haney re\nported that “[e]ach one of the facilities I toured was short\nof significant amounts of space needed to perform other\nwise critical tasks and responsibilities.” Id., at 597–598.\nIn one facility, staff cared for 7,525 prisoners in space\ndesigned for one-third as many. Juris. App. 93a. Staff\noperate out of converted storage rooms, closets, bath\nrooms, shower rooms, and visiting centers. These make\nshift facilities impede the effective delivery of care and\nplace the safety of medical professionals in jeopardy,\ncompounding the difficulty of hiring additional staff.\n    This shortfall of resources relative to demand contrib\nutes to significant delays in treatment. Mentally ill pris\noners are housed in administrative segregation while\nawaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds\nfor appropriate care. One correctional officer indicated\nthat he had kept mentally ill prisoners in segregation for\n“ ‘6 months or more.’ ” App. 594. Other prisoners awaiting\ncare are held in tiny, phone-booth sized cages. The record\ndocuments instances of prisoners committing suicide while\nawaiting treatment.6\n    Delays are no less severe in the context of physical care.\n——————\n  6 For instance, Dr. Pablo Stewart reported that one prisoner was\n\nreferred to a crisis bed but, “[a]fter learning that the restraint room\nwas not available and that there were no crisis beds open, staff moved\n[the prisoner] back to his administrative segregation cell without any\nprescribed observation.” App. 736. The prisoner “hanged himself that\nnight in his cell.” Ibid.; see also Juris. App. 99a.\n22                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPrisons have backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see\na doctor. Doc. 3231–13, at 18. A review of referrals for\nurgent specialty care at one prison revealed that only 105\nof 316 pending referrals had a scheduled appointment,\nand only 2 had an appointment scheduled to occur within\n14 days. Id., at 22–23. Urgent specialty referrals at one\nprison had been pending for six months to a year. Id.,\nat 27.\n  Crowding also creates unsafe and unsanitary living\nconditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and\nmental health care. A medical expert described living\nquarters in converted gymnasiums or dayrooms, where\nlarge numbers of prisoners may share just a few toilets\nand showers, as “ ‘breeding grounds for disease.’ ”7 Juris.\nApp. 102a. Cramped conditions promote unrest and vio\nlence, making it difficult for prison officials to monitor and\ncontrol the prison population. On any given day, prisoners\nin the general prison population may become ill, thus\nentering the plaintiff class; and overcrowding may prevent\nimmediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering,\ndeath, or spread of disease. After one prisoner was as\nsaulted in a crowded gymnasium, prison staff did not even\nlearn of the injury until the prisoner had been dead for\nseveral hours. Tr. 382. Living in crowded, unsafe, and\nunsanitary conditions can cause prisoners with latent\nmental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.\nCrowding may also impede efforts to improve delivery of\n\n——————\n  7 Correctional officials at trial described several outbreaks of disease.\n\nOne officer testified that antibiotic-resistant staph infections spread\nwidely among the prison population and described prisoners “bleeding,\noozing with pus that is soaking through their clothes when they come\nin to get the wound covered and treated.” Tr. 601, 604–605. Another\nwitness testified that inmates with influenza were sent back from the\ninfirmary due to a lack of beds and that the disease quickly spread to\n“more than half ” the 340 prisoners in the housing unit, with the result\nthat the unit was placed on lockdown for a week. Id., at 720–721.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncare. Two prisoners committed suicide by hanging after\nbeing placed in cells that had been identified as requiring\na simple fix to remove attachment points that could sup\nport a noose. The repair was not made because doing so\nwould involve removing prisoners from the cells, and there\nwas no place to put them. Id., at 769–777. More gen\nerally, Jeanne Woodford, the former acting secretary of\nCalifornia’s prisons, testified that there “ ‘are simply too\nmany issues that arise from such a large number of pris\noners,’ ” and that, as a result, “ ‘management spends virtu\nally all of its time fighting fires instead of engaging in\nthoughtful decision-making and planning’ ” of the sort\nneeded to fashion an effective remedy for these constitu\ntional violations. Juris. App. 82a.\n    Increased violence also requires increased reliance on\nlockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede\nthe effective delivery of care. In 2006, prison officials\ninstituted 449 lockdowns. Id., at 116a. The average lock\ndown lasted 12 days, and 20 lockdowns lasted 60 days or\nlonger. Ibid. During lockdowns, staff must either escort\nprisoners to medical facilities or bring medical staff to the\nprisoners. Either procedure puts additional strain on\nalready overburdened medical and custodial staff. Some\nprogramming for the mentally ill even may be canceled\naltogether during lockdowns, and staff may be unable to\nsupervise the delivery of psychotropic medications.\n    The effects of overcrowding are particularly acute in\nthe prisons’ reception centers, intake areas that process\n140,000 new or returning prisoners every year. Id., at\n85a. Crowding in these areas runs as high as 300% of\ndesign capacity. Id., at 86a. Living conditions are\n“ ‘toxic,’ ” and a lack of treatment space impedes efforts to\nidentify inmate medical or mental health needs and pro\nvide even rudimentary care. Id., at 92a. The former\nwarden of San Quentin reported that doctors in that\nprison’s reception center “ ‘were unable to keep up with\n24                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nphysicals or provid[e] any kind of chronic care follow-up.’ ”\nId., at 90a. Inmates spend long periods of time in these\nareas awaiting transfer to the general population. Some\nprisoners are held in the reception centers for their entire\nperiod of incarceration.\n    Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary\ncause of the constitutional violations. The former warden\nof San Quentin and former acting secretary of the Califor\nnia prisons concluded that crowding “makes it ‘virtually\nimpossible for the organization to develop, much less\nimplement, a plan to provide prisoners with adequate\ncare.’ ” Id., at 83a. The former executive director of the\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice testified that\n“ ‘[e]verything revolves around overcrowding” and that\n“ ‘overcrowding is the primary cause of the medical and\nmental health care violations.’ ” Id., at 127a. The former\nhead of corrections in Pennsylvania, Washington, and\nMaine testified that overcrowding is “ ‘overwhelming the\nsystem both in terms of sheer numbers, in terms of the\nspace available, in terms of providing healthcare.’ ” Ibid.\nAnd the current secretary of the Pennsylvania Depart\nment of Corrections testified that “ ‘‘the biggest inhibiting\nfactor right now in California being able to deliver appro\npriate mental health and medical care is the severe over\ncrowding.’ ” Id., at 82a.\n                             2\n   The State attempts to undermine the substantial evi\ndence presented at trial, and the three-judge court’s find\nings of fact, by complaining that the three-judge court did\nnot allow it to present evidence of current prison condi\ntions. This suggestion lacks a factual basis.\n   The three-judge court properly admitted evidence of\ncurrent conditions as relevant to the issues before it. The\nthree-judge court allowed discovery until a few months\nbefore trial; expert witnesses based their conclusions on\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             25\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrecent observations of prison conditions; the court ad\nmitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Plata\nReceiver and Coleman Special Master; and both parties\npresented testimony related to current conditions, includ\ning understaffing, inadequate facilities, and unsanitary\nand unsafe living conditions. See supra, at 4–8, 19–24.\nDr. Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on\ntours of eight California prisons. App. 539. These tours\noccurred as late as August 2008, two weeks before Dr.\nHaney submitted his report and less than four months\nbefore the first day of trial. Id., at 585; see also id., at 563,\n565, 580 (July tours). Other experts submitted reports\nbased on similar observations. See, e.g., Doc. 3231–13,\nat 6 (Dr. Shansky); App. 646 (Dr. Stewart); id., at 1245\n(Austin); id., at 1312 (Lehman).\n   The three-judge court’s opinion cited and relied on this\nevidence of current conditions. The court relied exten\nsively on the expert witness reports. See generally Juris.\nApp. 85a–143a. The court cited the most current data\navailable on suicides and preventable deaths in the Cali\nfornia prisons. Id., at 123a, 125a. The court relied on\nstatistics on staff vacancies that dated to three months\nbefore trial, id., at 105a, 108a, and statistics on shortages\nof treatment beds for the same period, id., at 97a. These\nare just examples of the extensive evidence of current\nconditions that informed every aspect of the judgment of\nthe three-judge court. The three-judge court did not abuse\nits discretion when it also cited findings made in earlier\ndecisions of the Plata and Coleman District Courts. Those\nfindings remained relevant to establish the nature of these\nlongstanding, continuing constitutional violations.\n   It is true that the three-judge court established a cutoff\ndate for discovery a few months before trial. The order\nstated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed\nuntil that date, and that evidence of “changed prison\nconditions” after that date would not be admitted. App.\n26                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1190. The court also excluded evidence not pertinent to\nthe issue whether a population limit is appropriate under\nthe PLRA, including evidence relevant solely to the exis\ntence of an ongoing constitutional violation. The court\nreasoned that its decision was limited to the issue of rem\nedy and that the merits of the constitutional violation had\nalready been determined. The three-judge court made\nclear that all such evidence would be considered “[t]o the\nextent that it illuminates questions that are properly\nbefore the court.” App. 2339.\n   Both rulings were within the sound discretion of the\nthree-judge court. Orderly trial management may require\ndiscovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litiga\ntion of the merits and the remedy. The State in fact\nrepresented to the three-judge court that it would be “ap\npropriate” to cut off discovery before trial because “like\nplaintiffs, we, too, are really gearing up and going into a\npretrial mode.” Id., at 1683. And if the State truly be\nlieved there was no longer a violation, it could have argued\nto the Coleman and Plata District Courts that a three\njudge court should not be convened because the District\nCourts’ prior orders had not “failed to remedy the dep\nrivation” of prisoners’ constitutional rights. 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(i); see also supra, at 16–17. Once the three\njudge court was convened, that court was not required to\nreconsider the merits. Its role was solely to consider the\npropriety and necessity of a population limit.\n   The State does not point to any significant evidence that\nit was unable to present and that would have changed the\noutcome of the proceedings. To the contrary, the record\nand opinion make clear that the decision of the three\njudge court was based on current evidence pertaining to\nongoing constitutional violations.\n                              3\n     The three-judge court acknowledged that the violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  27\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwere caused by factors in addition to overcrowding and\nthat reducing crowding in the prisons would not entirely\ncure the violations. This is consistent with the reports\nof the Coleman Special Master and Plata Receiver, both\nof whom concluded that even a significant reduction in the\nprison population would not remedy the violations absent\ncontinued efforts to train staff, improve facilities, and\nreform procedures. App. 487, 1054.8 The three-judge\ncourt nevertheless found that overcrowding was the pri\nmary cause in the sense of being the foremost cause of the\nviolation.\n   This understanding of the primary cause requirement is\nconsistent with the text of the PLRA. The State in fact\nconcedes that it proposed this very definition of primary\ncause to the three-judge court. “Primary” is defined as\n“[f]irst or highest in rank, quality, or importance; princi\npal.” American Heritage Dictionary 1393 (4th ed. 2000);\nsee also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1800 (2002) (defining “primary” as “first in rank or impor\ntance”); 12 Oxford English Dictionary 472 (2d ed. 1989)\n(defining “primary” as “[o]f the first or highest rank or\nimportance; that claims the first consideration; principal,\nchief ”). Overcrowding need only be the foremost, chief, or\nprincipal cause of the violation. If Congress had intended\n——————\n  8 The Plata Receiver concluded that those who believed a population\n\nreduction would be a panacea were “simply wrong.” App. 1054–1055.\nThe Receiver nevertheless made clear that “the time this process will\ntake, and the cost and the scope of intrusion by the Federal Court\ncannot help but increase, and increase in a very significant manner, if\nthe scope and characteristics of [California prison] overcrowding\ncontinue.” Id., at 1053. The Coleman Special Master likewise found\nthat a large release of prisoners, without other relief, would leave the\nviolation “largely unmitigated” even though deficiencies in care “are\nunquestionably exacerbated by overcrowding” and “defendants’ ability\nto provide required mental health services would be enhanced consid\nerably by a reduction in the overall census” of the prisons. App. 486–\n487.\n28                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto require that crowding be the only cause, it would have\nsaid so, assuming in its judgment that definition would be\nconsistent with constitutional limitations.\n   As this case illustrates, constitutional violations in\nconditions of confinement are rarely susceptible of simple\nor straightforward solutions. In addition to overcrowding\nthe failure of California’s prisons to provide adequate\nmedical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic\nand worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in\nfavor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic admin\nistrative failures. The Plata District Judge, in his order\nappointing the Receiver, compared the problem to “ ‘a\nspider web, in which the tension of the various strands is\ndetermined by the relationship among all the parts of the\nweb, so that if one pulls on a single strand, the tension of\nthe entire web is redistributed in a new and complex\npattern.’ ” App. 966–967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discre\ntionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies and Judicial\nLegitimacy, 91 Yale L. J. 635, 645 (1982)); see also Hutto,\n437 U. S., at 688 (noting “the interdependence of the con\nditions producing the violation,” including overcrowd\ning). Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes,\nincluding overcrowding, will yield a solution.\n   The PLRA should not be interpreted to place undue\nrestrictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion\npractical remedies when confronted with complex and\nintractable constitutional violations. Congress limited the\navailability of limits on prison populations, but it did not\nforbid these measures altogether. See 18 U. S. C. §3626.\nThe House Report accompanying the PLRA explained:\n       “While prison caps must be the remedy of last re\n     sort, a court still retains the power to order this\n     remedy despite its intrusive nature and harmful con\n     sequences to the public if, but only if, it is truly\n     necessary to prevent an actual violation of a prisoner’s\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    federal rights.” H. R. Rep. No. 104–21, p. 25 (1995).\nCourts should presume that Congress was sensitive to the\nreal-world problems faced by those who would remedy\nconstitutional violations in the prisons and that Congress\ndid not leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of\ntheir constitutional rights. A reading of the PLRA that\nwould render population limits unavailable in practice\nwould raise serious constitutional concerns. See, e.g.,\nBowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476\nU. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986). A finding that overcrowding\nis the “primary cause” of a violation is therefore permissi\nble, despite the fact that additional steps will be required\nto remedy the violation.\n                               C\n  The three-judge court was also required to find by clear\nand convincing evidence that “no other relief will remedy\nthe violation of the Federal right.” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).\n  The State argues that the violation could have been\nremedied through a combination of new construction,\ntransfers of prisoners out of State, hiring of medical per\nsonnel, and continued efforts by the Plata Receiver and\nColeman Special Master. The order in fact permits the\nState to comply with the population limit by transferring\nprisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States, or\nby constructing new facilities to raise the prisons’ design\ncapacity. And the three-judge court’s order does not bar\nthe State from undertaking any other remedial efforts. If\nthe State does find an adequate remedy other than a\npopulation limit, it may seek modification or termination\nof the three-judge court’s order on that basis. The evi\ndence at trial, however, supports the three-judge court’s\nconclusion that an order limited to other remedies would\nnot provide effective relief.\n  The State’s argument that out-of-state transfers provide\na less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail\n30                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause requiring out-of-state transfers itself qualifies as\na population limit under the PLRA.9 Such an order “has\nthe purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison\npopulation, or . . . directs the release from or nonadmission\nof prisoners to a prison.” §3626(g)(4). The same is true of\ntransfers to county facilities. Transfers provide a means\nto reduce the prison population in compliance with the\nthree-judge court’s order. They are not a less restrictive\nalternative to that order.\n   Even if out-of-state transfers could be regarded as a less\nrestrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no\nevidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to\nrelieve overcrowding. The State complains that the Cole\nman District Court slowed the rate of transfer by requir\ning inspections to assure that the receiving institutions\nwere in compliance with the Eighth Amendment, but the\nState has made no effort to show that it has the resources\nand the capacity to transfer significantly larger numbers\nof prisoners absent that condition.\n   Construction of new facilities, in theory, could alleviate\novercrowding, but the three-judge court found no realistic\npossibility that California would be able to build itself out\nof this crisis. At the time of the court’s decision the State\nhad plans to build new medical and housing facilities, but\nfunding for some plans had not been secured and funding\nfor other plans had been delayed by the legislature for\nyears. Particularly in light of California’s ongoing fiscal\ncrisis, the three-judge court deemed “chimerical” any\n“remedy that requires significant additional spending by\nthe state.” Juris. App. 151a. Events subsequent to the\n——————\n  9 A program of voluntary transfers by the State would, of course, be\n\nless restrictive than an order mandating a reduction in the prison\npopulation. In light of the State’s longstanding failure to remedy these\nserious constitutional violations, the three-judge court was under no\nobligation to consider voluntary population-reduction measures by the\nState as a workable alternative to injunctive relief.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

In October 2010, the State notified the Coleman\nDistrict Court that a substantial component of its con\nstruction plans had been delayed indefinitely by the legis\nlature. And even if planned construction were to be\ncompleted, the Plata Receiver found that many so-called\n“expansion” plans called for cramming more prisoners into\nexisting prisons without expanding administrative and\nsupport facilities. Juris. App. 151a–152a. The former\nacting secretary of the California prisons explained that\nthese plans would “ ‘compound the burdens imposed on\nprison administrators and line staff’’ ” by adding to the\nalready overwhelming prison population, creating new\nbarriers to achievement of a remedy. Id., at 152a.\n  The three-judge court also rejected additional hiring as\na realistic means to achieve a remedy. The State for years\nhad been unable to fill positions necessary for the ade\nquate provision of medical and mental health care, and\nthe three-judge court found no reason to expect a change.\nAlthough the State points to limited gains in staffing\nbetween 2007 and 2008, the record shows that the prison\nsystem remained chronically understaffed through trial in\n2008. See supra, at 20. The three-judge court found that\nviolence and other negative conditions caused by crowding\nmade it difficult to hire and retain needed staff. The court\nalso concluded that there would be insufficient space for\nadditional staff to work even if adequate personnel could\nsomehow be retained. Additional staff cannot help to\nremedy the violation if they have no space in which to see\nand treat patients.\n  The three-judge court also did not err, much less commit\nclear error, when it concluded that, absent a population\nreduction, continued efforts by the Receiver and Special\nMaster would not achieve a remedy. Both the Receiver\nand the Special Master filed reports stating that over\ncrowding posed a significant barrier to their efforts. The\n32                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPlata Receiver stated that he was determined to achieve\na remedy even without a population reduction, but he\nwarned that such an effort would “all but bankrupt” the\nState. App. 1053. The Coleman Special Master noted\neven more serious concerns, stating that previous reme\ndial efforts had “succumbed to the inexorably rising tide of\npopulation.” App. 489. Both reports are persuasive evi\ndence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem\nedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least\nrequire vast expenditures of resources by the State. Noth\ning in the long history of the Coleman and Plata actions\ndemonstrates any real possibility that the necessary re\nsources would be made available.\n   The State claims that, even if each of these measures\nwere unlikely to remedy the violation, they would succeed\nin doing so if combined together. Aside from asserting this\nproposition, the State offers no reason to believe it is so.\nAttempts to remedy the violations in Plata have been\nongoing for 9 years. In Coleman, remedial efforts have\nbeen ongoing for 16. At one time, it may have been possi\nble to hope that these violations would be cured without a\nreduction in overcrowding. A long history of failed reme\ndial orders, together with substantial evidence of over\ncrowding’s deleterious effects on the provision of care,\ncompels a different conclusion today.\n   The common thread connecting the State’s proposed\nremedial efforts is that they would require the State to\nexpend large amounts of money absent a reduction in\novercrowding. The Court cannot ignore the political and\nfiscal reality behind this case. California’s Legislature has\nnot been willing or able to allocate the resources necessary\nto meet this crisis absent a reduction in overcrowding.\nThere is no reason to believe it will begin to do so now,\nwhen the State of California is facing an unprecedented\nbudgetary shortfall. As noted above, the legislature re\ncently failed to allocate funds for planned new construc\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Without a reduction in overcrowd\ning, there will be no efficacious remedy for the unconsti\ntutional care of the sick and mentally ill in California’s\nprisons.\n                             D\n  The PLRA states that no prospective relief shall issue\nwith respect to prison conditions unless it is narrowly\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of a federal right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation. 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a). When determining whether these requirements\nare met, courts must “give substantial weight to any ad\nverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system.” Ibid.\n                               1\n   The three-judge court acknowledged that its order “is\nlikely to affect inmates without medical conditions or\nserious mental illness.” Juris. App. 172a. This is because\nreducing California’s prison population will require reduc\ning the number of prisoners outside the class through\nsteps such as parole reform, sentencing reform, use of\ngood-time credits, or other means to be determined by the\nState. Reducing overcrowding will also have positive\neffects beyond facilitating timely and adequate access to\nmedical care, including reducing the incidence of prison\nviolence and ameliorating unsafe living conditions. Ac\ncording to the State, these collateral consequences are\nevidence that the order sweeps more broadly than\nnecessary.\n   The population limit imposed by the three-judge court\ndoes not fail narrow tailoring simply because it will have\npositive effects beyond the plaintiff class. Narrow tailor\ning requires a “ ‘ “fit” between the [remedy’s] ends and the\nmeans chosen to accomplish those ends.’ ” Board of Trus\n34                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480\n(1989). The scope of the remedy must be proportional\nto the scope of the violation, and the order must extend\nno further than necessary to remedy the violation. This\nCourt has rejected remedial orders that unnecessarily\nreach out to improve prison conditions other than those\nthat violate the Constitution. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.\n343, 357 (1996). But the precedents do not suggest that a\nnarrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional\nviolation is invalid simply because it will have collateral\neffects.\n  Nor does anything in the text of the PLRA require that\nresult. The PLRA states that a remedy shall extend no\nfurther than necessary to remedy the violation of the\nrights of a “particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(1)(A). This means only that the scope of the\norder must be determined with reference to the consti\ntutional violations established by the specific plaintiffs\nbefore the court.\n  This case is unlike cases where courts have impermis\nsibly reached out to control the treatment of persons or\ninstitutions beyond the scope of the violation. See Dayton\nBd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 420 (1977). Even\nprisoners with no present physical or mental illness may\nbecome afflicted, and all prisoners in California are at risk\nso long as the State continues to provide inadequate care.\nPrisoners in the general population will become sick, and\nwill become members of the plaintiff classes, with rou-\ntine frequency; and overcrowding may prevent the timely\ndiagnosis and care necessary to provide effective treat\nment and to prevent further spread of disease. Relief\ntargeted only at present members of the plaintiff classes\nmay therefore fail to adequately protect future class mem\nbers who will develop serious physical or mental illness.\nPrisoners who are not sick or mentally ill do not yet have a\nclaim that they have been subjected to care that violates\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

They are\nthat system’s next potential victims.\n   A release order limited to prisoners within the plaintiff\nclasses would, if anything, unduly limit the ability of State\nofficials to determine which prisoners should be released.\nAs the State acknowledges in its brief, “release of seriously\nmentally ill inmates [would be] likely to create special\ndangers because of their recidivism rates.” Consolidated\nReply Brief for Appellants 34. The order of the three\njudge court gives the State substantial flexibility to\ndetermine who should be released. If the State truly be\nlieves that a release order limited to sick and mentally ill\ninmates would be preferable to the order entered by the\nthree-judge court, the State can move the three-judge\ncourt for modification of the order on that basis. The State\nhas not requested this relief from this Court.\n   The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses\nthe entire prison system, rather than separately assessing\nthe need for a population limit at every institution. The\nColeman court found a systemwide violation when it first\nafforded relief, and in Plata the State stipulated to sys\ntemwide relief when it conceded the existence of a viola\ntion. Both the Coleman Special Master and the Plata\nReceiver have filed numerous reports detailing system\nwide deficiencies in medical and mental health care.\nCalifornia’s medical care program is run at a systemwide\nlevel, and resources are shared among the correctional\nfacilities.\n   Although the three-judge court’s order addresses the\nentire California prison system, it affords the State flexi\nbility to accommodate differences between institutions.\nThere is no requirement that every facility comply with\nthe 137.5% limit. Assuming no constitutional violation\nresults, some facilities may retain populations in excess of\nthe limit provided other facilities fall sufficiently below it\n36                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nso the system as a whole remains in compliance with the\norder. This will allow prison officials to shift prisoners\nto facilities that are better able to accommodate over\ncrowding, or out of facilities where retaining sufficient\nmedical staff has been difficult. The alternative—a series\nof institution-specific population limits—would require\nfederal judges to make these choices. Leaving this discre\ntion to state officials does not make the order overbroad.\n   Nor is the order overbroad because it limits the State’s\nauthority to run its prisons, as the State urges in its brief.\nWhile the order does in some respects shape or control the\nState’s authority in the realm of prison administration, it\ndoes so in a manner that leaves much to the State’s discre\ntion. The State may choose how to allocate prisoners\nbetween institutions; it may choose whether to increase\nthe prisons’ capacity through construction or reduce the\npopulation; and, if it does reduce the population, it may\ndecide what steps to take to achieve the necessary reduc\ntion. The order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a\nconstitutional violation.\n   As the State implements the order of the three-judge\ncourt, time and experience may reveal targeted and effec\ntive remedies that will end the constitutional violations\neven without a significant decrease in the general prison\npopulation. The State will be free to move the three-judge\ncourt for modification of its order on that basis, and these\nmotions would be entitled to serious consideration. See\ninfra, at 45–48. At this time, the State has not proposed\nany realistic alternative to the order. The State’s desire to\navoid a population limit, justified as according respect to\nstate authority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of\ncontinuing violations of the rights of sick and mentally ill\nprisoners, with the result that many more will die or\nneedlessly suffer. The Constitution does not permit this\nwrong.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          37\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              2\n   In reaching its decision, the three-judge court gave\n“substantial weight” to any potential adverse impact on\npublic safety from its order. The court devoted nearly 10\ndays of trial to the issue of public safety, and it gave the\nquestion extensive attention in its opinion. Ultimately,\nthe court concluded that it would be possible to reduce\nthe prison population “in a manner that preserves public\nsafety and the operation of the criminal justice system.”\nJuris. App. 247a–248a.\n   The PLRA’s requirement that a court give “substantial\nweight” to public safety does not require the court to cer\ntify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the\npublic. A contrary reading would depart from the statute’s\ntext by replacing the word “substantial” with “conclusive.”\nWhenever a court issues an order requiring the State to\nadjust its incarceration and criminal justice policy, there\nis a risk that the order will have some adverse impact on\npublic safety in some sectors. This is particularly true\nwhen the order requires release of prisoners before their\nsentence has been served. Persons incarcerated for even\none offense may have committed many other crimes prior\nto arrest and conviction, and some number can be ex\npected to commit further crimes upon release. Yet the\nPLRA contemplates that courts will retain authority to\nissue orders necessary to remedy constitutional violations,\nincluding authority to issue population limits when neces\nsary. See supra, at 28–29. A court is required to consider\nthe public safety consequences of its order and to struc\nture, and monitor, its ruling in a way that mitigates those\nconsequences while still achieving an effective remedy of\nthe constitutional violation.\n   This inquiry necessarily involves difficult predictive\njudgments regarding the likely effects of court orders.\nAlthough these judgments are normally made by state\nofficials, they necessarily must be made by courts when\n38                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthose courts fashion injunctive relief to remedy serious\nconstitutional violations in the prisons. These questions\nare difficult and sensitive, but they are factual questions\nand should be treated as such. Courts can, and should,\nrely on relevant and informed expert testimony when\nmaking factual findings. It was proper for the three-judge\ncourt to rely on the testimony of prison officials from\nCalifornia and other States. Those experts testified on the\nbasis of empirical evidence and extensive experience in\nthe field of prison administration.\n   The three-judge court credited substantial evidence that\nprison populations can be reduced in a manner that does\nnot increase crime to a significant degree. Some evidence\nindicated that reducing overcrowding in California’s pris\nons could even improve public safety. Then-Governor\nSchwarzenegger, in his emergency proclamation on over\ncrowding, acknowledged that “ ‘overcrowding causes harm\nto people and property, leads to inmate unrest and mis\nconduct, . . . and increases recidivism as shown within this\nstate and in others.’ ” Juris. App. 191a–192a. The former\nwarden of San Quentin and acting secretary of the Cali\nfornia prison system testified that she “ ‘absolutely be\nlieve[s] that we make people worse, and that we are not\nmeeting public safety by the way we treat people.’ ”10 Id.,\nat 129a. And the head of Pennsylvania’s correctional\nsystem testified that measures to reduce prison population\n——————\n  10 The former head of correctional systems in Washington, Maine, and\nPennsylvania, likewise referred to California’s prisons as “ ‘crimino\ngenic.’ ” Juris. App. 191a. The Yolo County chief probation officer\ntestified that “ ‘it seems like [the prisons] produce additional criminal\nbehavior.’ ” Id., at 190a. A former professor of sociology at George\nWashington University, reported that California’s present recidivism\nrate is among the highest in the Nation. App. 1246. And the three\njudge court noted the report of California’s Little Hoover Commission,\nwhich stated that “ ‘[e]ach year, California communities are burdened\nwith absorbing 123,000 offenders returning from prison, often more\ndangerous than when they left.’ ” Juris. App. 191a.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Juris. App. 245a.11 Washington’s former secretary\nof corrections testified that his State had implemented\npopulation reduction methods, including parole reform\nand expansion of good time credits, without any “deleteri\nous effect on crime.” Tr. 2008–2009. In light of this evi\ndence, the three-judge court concluded that any negative\nimpact on public safety would be “substantially offset, and\nperhaps entirely eliminated, by the public safety benefits”\n——————\n   11 Philadelphia’s experience in the early 1990’s with a federal court\n\norder mandating reductions in the prison population was less positive,\nand that history illustrates the undoubted need for caution in this area.\nOne congressional witness testified that released prisoners committed\n79 murders and multiple other offenses. See Hearing on S. 3 et al.\nbefore the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n45 (1995) (statement of Lynne Abraham, District Attorney of Philadel\nphia). Lead counsel for the plaintiff class in that case responded that\n“[t]his inflammatory assertion has never been documented.” Id., at\n212 (statement of David Richman). The Philadelphia decree was also\ndifferent from the order entered in this case. Among other things, it\n“prohibited the City from admitting to its prisons any additional\ninmates, except for persons charged with, or convicted of, murder,\nforcible rape, or a crime involving the use of a gun or knife in the\ncommission of an aggravated assault or robbery.” Harris v.

The difficulty of determining the precise\nrelevance of Philadelphia’s experience illustrates why appellate courts\ndefer to the trier of fact. The three-judge court had the opportunity to\nhear testimony on population reduction measures in other jurisdictions\nand to ask relevant questions of informed expert witnesses.\n40                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof a reduction in overcrowding. Juris. App. 248a.\n   The court found that various available methods of re\nducing overcrowding would have little or no impact on\npublic safety. Expansion of good-time credits would allow\nthe State to give early release to only those prisoners who\npose the least risk of reoffending. Diverting low-risk\noffenders to community programs such as drug treatment,\nday reporting centers, and electronic monitoring would\nlikewise lower the prison population without releasing\nviolent convicts.12 The State now sends large numbers of\npersons to prison for violating a technical term or condi\ntion of their parole, and it could reduce the prison popula\ntion by punishing technical parole violations through\ncommunity-based programs. This last measure would be\nparticularly beneficial as it would reduce crowding in the\nreception centers, which are especially hard hit by over\ncrowding. See supra, at 23–24. The court’s order took\naccount of public safety concerns by giving the State sub\nstantial flexibility to select among these and other means\nof reducing overcrowding.\n   The State submitted a plan to reduce its prison popula\ntion in accordance with the three-judge court’s order, and\nit complains that the three-judge court approved that\nplan without considering whether the specific measures\ncontained within it would substantially threaten public\nsafety. The three-judge court, however, left the choice of\nhow best to comply with its population limit to state\n\n——————\n   12 Expanding such community-based measures may require an ex\n\npenditure of resources by the State to fund new programs or expand\nexisting ones. The State complains that the order therefore requires it\nto “divert” savings that will be achieved by reducing the prison popula\ntion and that setting budgetary priorities in this manner is a “severe,\nunlawful intrusion on the State authority.” Brief for Appellants 55.\nThis argument is not convincing. The order does not require the State\nto use any particular approach to reduce its prison population or\nallocate its resources.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           41\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprison officials. The court was not required to second\nguess the exercise of that discretion. Courts should pre\nsume that state officials are in a better position to gauge\nhow best to preserve public safety and balance competing\ncorrectional and law enforcement concerns. The decision\nto leave details of implementation to the State’s discretion\nprotected public safety by leaving sensitive policy deci\nsions to responsible and competent state officials.\n   During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact\nbegan to implement measures to reduce the prison popula\ntion. See Supp. Brief for Appellants 1. These measures\nwill shift “thousands” of prisoners from the state prisons\nto the county jails by “mak[ing] certain felonies punishable\nby imprisonment in county jail” and “requir[ing] that\nindividuals returned to custody for violating their condi\ntions of parole ‘serve any custody term in county jail.’ ”\nIbid. These developments support the three-judge court’s\nconclusion that the prison population can be reduced in\na manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on\npublic safety.\n                             III\n   Establishing the population at which the State could\nbegin to provide constitutionally adequate medical and\nmental health care, and the appropriate time frame within\nwhich to achieve the necessary reduction, requires a de\ngree of judgment. The inquiry involves uncertain predic\ntions regarding the effects of population reductions, as\nwell as difficult determinations regarding the capacity of\nprison officials to provide adequate care at various popu\nlation levels. Courts have substantial flexibility when\nmaking these judgments. “ ‘Once invoked, “the scope of a\ndistrict court’s equitable powers . . . is broad, for breadth\nand flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” ’ ”\nHutto, 437 U. S., at 687, n. 9 (quoting Milliken v. Bradley,\n433 U. S. 267, 281 (1977), in turn quoting Swann v.\n42                    BROWN v.

S. 1, 15 (1971)).\n   Nevertheless, the PLRA requires a court to adopt a\nremedy that is “narrowly tailored” to the constitutional\nviolation and that gives “substantial weight” to public\nsafety. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). When a court is imposing a\npopulation limit, this means the court must set the limit\nat the highest population consistent with an efficacious\nremedy. The court must also order the population reduc\ntion achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably\nconsistent with public safety.\n                              A\n   The three-judge court concluded that the population of\nCalifornia’s prisons should be capped at 137.5% of design\ncapacity. This conclusion is supported by the record.\nIndeed, some evidence supported a limit as low as 100% of\ndesign capacity. The chief deputy secretary of Correc\ntional Healthcare Services for the California prisons tes\ntified that California’s prisons “ ‘were not designed and\nmade no provision for any expansion of medical care space\nbeyond the initial 100% of capacity.’ ” Juris. App. 176a.\nOther evidence supported a limit as low as 130%. The\nhead of the State’s Facilities Strike Team recommended\nreducing the population to 130% of design capacity as a\nlong-term goal. Id., at 179a–180a. A former head of cor\nrectional systems in Washington State, Maine, and Penn\nsylvania testified that a 130% limit would “ ‘give prison\nofficials and staff the ability to provide the necessary\nprograms and services for California’s prisoners.’ ” Id., at\n180a. A former executive director of the Texas prisons\ntestified that a limit of 130% was “ ‘realistic and appro\npriate’ ” and would “ ‘ensure that [California’s] prisons are\nsafe and provide legally required services.’ ” Ibid. And a\nformer acting secretary of the California prisons agreed\nwith a 130% limit with the caveat that a 130% limit might\nprove inadequate in some older facilities.

S. ____ (2011)           43\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   According to the State, this testimony expressed the\nwitnesses’ policy preferences, rather than their views as to\nwhat would cure the constitutional violation. Of course,\ncourts must not confuse professional standards with con\nstitutional requirements. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S.\n337, 348, n. 13 (1981). But expert opinion may be relevant\nwhen determining what is obtainable and what is accept\nable in corrections philosophy. See supra, at 37–38.\nNothing in the record indicates that the experts in this\ncase imposed their own policy views or lost sight of the\nunderlying violations. To the contrary, the witnesses\ntestified that a 130% population limit would allow the\nState to remedy the constitutionally inadequate provision\nof medical and mental health care. When expert opinion\nis addressed to the question of how to remedy the relevant\nconstitutional violations, as it was here, federal judges can\ngive it considerable weight.\n   The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has set 130% as a\nlong-term goal for population levels in the federal prison\nsystem. Brief for Appellants 43–44. The State suggests\nthe expert witnesses impermissibly adopted this profes\nsional standard in their testimony. But courts are not\nrequired to disregard expert opinion solely because it\nadopts or accords with professional standards. Profes\nsional standards may be “helpful and relevant with re\nspect to some questions.” Chapman, supra, at 348, n. 13.\nThe witnesses testified that a limit of 130% was necessary\nto remedy the constitutional violations, not that it should\nbe adopted because it is a BOP standard. If anything, the\nfact that the BOP views 130% as a manageable population\ndensity bolsters the three-judge court’s conclusion that a\npopulation limit of 130% would alleviate the pressures\nassociated with overcrowding and allow the State to begin\nto provide constitutionally adequate care.\n   Although the three-judge court concluded that the “evi\ndence in support of a 130% limit is strong,” it found that\n44                   BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome upward adjustment was warranted in light of “the\ncaution and restraint required by the PLRA.” Juris. App.\n183a, 184a. The three-judge court noted evidence support\ning a higher limit. In particular, the State’s Corrections\nIndependent Review Panel had found that 145% was the\nmaximum “operable capacity” of California’s prisons, id.,\nat 181a–182a, although the relevance of that determina\ntion was undermined by the fact that the panel had not\nconsidered the need to provide constitutionally adequate\nmedical and mental health care, as the State itself con\ncedes. Brief for Coleman Appellees 45. After considering,\nbut discounting, this evidence, the three-judge court con\ncluded that the evidence supported a limit lower than\n145%, but higher than 130%. It therefore imposed a limit\nof 137.5%.\n   This weighing of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.\nThe adversary system afforded the court an opportunity\nto weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.\nThe plaintiffs’ evidentiary showing was intended to justify\na limit of 130%, and the State made no attempt to show\nthat any other number would allow for a remedy. There\nare also no scientific tools available to determine the\nprecise population reduction necessary to remedy a consti\ntutional violation of this sort. The three-judge court made\nthe most precise determination it could in light of the\nrecord before it. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring require\nment is satisfied so long as these equitable, remedial\njudgments are made with the objective of releasing the\nfewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious\nremedy. In light of substantial evidence supporting an\neven more drastic remedy, the three-judge court complied\nwith the requirement of the PLRA in this case.\n                            B\n  The three-judge court ordered the State to achieve this\nreduction within two years.

The\nState later submitted a plan for court approval that would\nachieve the required reduction within five years, and that\nwould reduce the prison population to 151% of design\ncapacity in two years. The State represented that this\nplan would “safely reach a population level of 137.5% over\ntime.” App. to Juris. Statement 32a. The three-judge\ncourt rejected this plan because it did not comply with the\ndeadline set by its order.\n   The State first had notice that it would be required to\nreduce its prison population in February 2009, when the\nthree-judge court gave notice of its tentative ruling after\ntrial. The 2-year deadline, however, will not begin to run\nuntil this Court issues its judgment. When that happens,\nthe State will have already had over two years to begin\ncomplying with the order of the three-judge court. The\nState has used the time productively. At oral argument,\nthe State indicated it had reduced its prison population\nby approximately 9,000 persons since the decision of the\nthree-judge court. After oral argument, the State filed a\nsupplemental brief indicating that it had begun to imple\nment measures to shift “thousands” of additional prisoners\nto county facilities. Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1.\n   Particularly in light of the State’s failure to contest the\nissue at trial, the three-judge court did not err when\nit established a 2-year deadline for relief. Plaintiffs pro\nposed a 2-year deadline, and the evidence at trial was\nintended to demonstrate the feasibility of a 2-year dead\nline. See Tr. 2979. Notably, the State has not asked this\nCourt to extend the 2-year deadline at this time.\n   The three-judge court, however, retains the authority,\nand the responsibility, to make further amendments to the\nexisting order or any modified decree it may enter as\nwarranted by the exercise of its sound discretion. “The\npower of a court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive\n46                    BROWN v.

In order to “give substantial weight to any adverse\nimpact on public safety,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A), the\nthree-judge court must give due deference to informed\nopinions as to what public safety requires, including the\nconsidered determinations of state officials regarding\nthe time in which a reduction in the prison population can\nbe achieved consistent with public safety. An extension of\ntime may allow the State to consider changing political,\neconomic, and other circumstances and to take advantage\nof opportunities for more effective remedies that arise as\nthe Special Master, the Receiver, the prison system, and\nthe three-judge court itself evaluate the progress being\nmade to correct unconstitutional conditions. At the same\ntime, both the three-judge court and state officials must\nbear in mind the need for a timely and efficacious remedy\nfor the ongoing violation of prisoners’ constitutional rights.\n   The State may wish to move for modification of the\nthree-judge court’s order to extend the deadline for the\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The three-judge\ncourt may grant such a request provided that the State\nsatisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed\nto ensure that measures are taken to implement the plan\nwithout undue delay. Appropriate preconditions may\ninclude a requirement that the State demonstrate that it\nhas the authority and the resources necessary to achieve\nthe required reduction within a 5-year period and to meet\nreasonable interim directives for population reduction.\nThe three-judge court may also condition an extension of\ntime on the State’s ability to meet interim benchmarks for\nimprovement in provision of medical and mental health\ncare.\n  The three-judge court, in its discretion, may also con\nsider whether it is appropriate to order the State to begin\nwithout delay to develop a system to identify prisoners\nwho are unlikely to reoffend or who might otherwise be\ncandidates for early release. Even with an extension of\ntime to construct new facilities and implement other\nreforms, it may become necessary to release prisoners to\ncomply with the court’s order. To do so safely, the State\nshould devise systems to select those prisoners least likely\nto jeopardize public safety. An extension of time may\nprovide the State a greater opportunity to refine and elab\norate those systems.\n  The State has already made significant progress toward\nreducing its prison population, including reforms that will\nresult in shifting “thousands” of prisoners to county jails.\nSee Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1. As the State makes\nfurther progress, the three-judge court should evaluate\nwhether its order remains appropriate. If significant\nprogress is made toward remedying the underlying consti\ntutional violations, that progress may demonstrate that\nfurther population reductions are not necessary or are less\n48                    BROWN v.

Were the State to make\nthis showing, the three-judge court in the exercise of its\ndiscretion could consider whether it is appropriate to ex\ntend or modify this timeline.\n   Experience with the three-judge court’s order may also\nlead the State to suggest other modifications. The three\njudge court should give any such requests serious consid\neration. The three-judge court should also formulate its\norders to allow the State and its officials the authority\nnecessary to address contingencies that may arise during\nthe remedial process.\n   These observations reflect the fact that the three-judge\ncourt’s order, like all continuing equitable decrees, must\nremain open to appropriate modification. They are not\nintended to cast doubt on the validity of the basic premise\nof the existing order. The medical and mental health care\nprovided by California’s prisons falls below the standard of\ndecency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment. This\nextensive and ongoing constitutional violation requires\na remedy, and a remedy will not be achieved without a\nreduction in overcrowding. The relief ordered by the\nthree-judge court is required by the Constitution and was\nauthorized by Congress in the PLRA. The State shall\nimplement the order without further delay.\n   The judgment of the three-judge court is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

One would think that, before\nallowing the decree of a federal district court to release\n46,000 convicted felons, this Court would bend every effort\nto read the law in such a way as to avoid that outrageous\nresult. Today, quite to the contrary, the Court disregards\nstringently drawn provisions of the governing statute, and\ntraditional constitutional limitations upon the power of a\nfederal judge, in order to uphold the absurd.\n  The proceedings that led to this result were a judicial\ntravesty. I dissent because the institutional reform the\nDistrict Court has undertaken violates the terms of the gov\nerning statute, ignores bedrock limitations on the power\nof Article III judges, and takes federal courts wildly\nbeyond their institutional capacity.\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                                I\n\n                               A\n\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that\n“[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to\nprison conditions shall extend no further than necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular\nplaintiff or plaintiffs”; that such relief must be “narrowly\ndrawn, [and] exten[d] no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation of the Federal right”; and that it must be “the\nleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). In deciding\nwhether these multiple limitations have been complied\nwith, it is necessary to identify with precision what is the\n“violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or\nplaintiffs” that has been alleged. What has been alleged\nhere, and what the injunction issued by the Court is\ntailored (narrowly or not) to remedy is the running of a\nprison system with inadequate medical facilities. That\nmay result in the denial of needed medical treatment to “a\nparticular [prisoner] or [prisoners],” thereby violating (ac\ncording to our cases) his or their Eighth Amendment\nrights. But the mere existence of the inadequate system\ndoes not subject to cruel and unusual punishment the\nentire prison population in need of medical care, including\nthose who receive it.\n  The Court acknowledges that the plaintiffs “do not base\ntheir case on deficiencies in care provided on any one\noccasion”; rather, “[p]laintiffs rely on systemwide deficien\ncies in the provision of medical and mental health care\nthat, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill pris\noners in California to ‘substantial risk of serious harm’\nand cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below\nthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress\nof a maturing society.” Ante, at 7, n. 3. But our judge\nempowering “evolving standards of decency” jurisprudence\n(with which, by the way, I heartily disagree, see, e.g.,\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. 551, 615–616 (2005) (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting)) does not prescribe (or at least has not until\ntoday prescribed) rules for the “decent” running of schools,\nprisons, and other government institutions. It forbids\n“indecent” treatment of individuals—in the context of this\ncase, the denial of medical care to those who need it. And\nthe persons who have a constitutional claim for denial of\nmedical care are those who are denied medical care—not\nall who face a “substantial risk” (whatever that is) of being\ndenied medical care.\n   The Coleman litigation involves “the class of seriously\nmentally ill persons in California prisons,” ante, at 8, and\nthe Plata litigation involves “the class of state prisoners\nwith serious medical conditions,” ante, at 9. The plaintiffs\ndo not appear to claim—and it would absurd to suggest—\nthat every single one of those prisoners has personally\nexperienced “torture or a lingering death,” ante, at 13\n(internal quotation marks omitted), as a consequence of\nthat bad medical system. Indeed, it is inconceivable that\nanything more than a small proportion of prisoners in\nthe plaintiff classes have personally received sufficiently\natrocious treatment that their Eighth Amendment right\nwas violated—which, as the Court recognizes, is why the\nplaintiffs do not premise their claim on “deficiencies in\ncare provided on any one occasion.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.\nRather, the plaintiffs’ claim is that they are all part of a\nmedical system so defective that some number of prisoners\nwill inevitably be injured by incompetent medical care,\nand that this number is sufficiently high so as to render\nthe system, as a whole, unconstitutional.\n   But what procedural principle justifies certifying a class\nof plaintiffs so they may assert a claim of systemic uncon\nstitutionality? I can think of two possibilities, both of\nwhich are untenable. The first is that although some or\nmost plaintiffs in the class do not individually have viable\nEighth Amendment claims, the class as a whole has collec\n4                      BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntively suffered an Eighth Amendment violation. That\ntheory is contrary to the bedrock rule that the sole purpose\nof classwide adjudication is to aggregate claims that are\nindividually viable. “A class action, no less than tradi\ntional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a\nfederal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at\nonce, instead of in separate suits. And like traditional\njoinder, it leaves the parties’ legal rights and duties intact\nand the rules of decision unchanged.” Shady Grove Or\nthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 14).\n   The second possibility is that every member of the plain\ntiff class has suffered an Eighth Amendment violation\nmerely by virtue of being a patient in a poorly-run prison\nsystem, and the purpose of the class is merely to aggregate\nall those individually viable claims. This theory has the\nvirtue of being consistent with procedural principles, but\nat the cost of a gross substantive departure from our case\nlaw. Under this theory, each and every prisoner who\nhappens to be a patient in a system that has systemic\nweaknesses—such as “hir[ing] any doctor who had a li\ncense, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ante, at 10 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—has suffered cruel or unusual\npunishment, even if that person cannot make an individu\nalized showing of mistreatment. Such a theory of the\nEighth Amendment is preposterous. And we have said as\nmuch in the past: “If . . . a healthy inmate who had suf\nfered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were\nable to claim violation of his constitutional right to medi\ncal care . . . simply on the ground that the prison medical\nfacilities were inadequate, the essential distinction be\ntween judge and executive would have disappeared: it\nwould have become the function of the courts to assure\nadequate medical care in prisons.” Lewis v. Casey, 518\nU. S. 343, 350 (1996).\n    Whether procedurally wrong or substantively wrong,\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe notion that the plaintiff class can allege an Eighth\nAmendment violation based on “systemwide deficiencies”\nis assuredly wrong. It follows that the remedy decreed\nhere is also contrary to law, since the theory of systemic\nunconstitutionality is central to the plaintiffs’ case. The\nPLRA requires plaintiffs to establish that the systemwide\ninjunction entered by the District Court was “narrowly\ndrawn” and “extends no further than necessary” to correct\n“the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff\nor plaintiffs.” If (as is the case) the only viable constitu\ntional claims consist of individual instances of mistreat\nment, then a remedy reforming the system as a whole goes\nfar beyond what the statute allows.\n   It is also worth noting the peculiarity that the vast\nmajority of inmates most generously rewarded by the re\nlease order—the 46,000 whose incarceration will be ended—\ndo not form part of any aggrieved class even under the\nCourt’s expansive notion of constitutional violation. Most\nof them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or\nsevere mental illness; and many will undoubtedly be fine\nphysical specimens who have developed intimidating\nmuscles pumping iron in the prison gym.\n                             B\n  Even if I accepted the implausible premise that the\nplaintiffs have established a systemwide violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment, I would dissent from the Court’s\nendorsement of a decrowding order. That order is an\nexample of what has become known as a “structural in\njunction.” As I have previously explained, structural\ninjunctions are radically different from the injunctions\ntraditionally issued by courts of equity, and presumably\npart of “the judicial Power” conferred on federal courts by\nArticle III:\n    “The mandatory injunctions issued upon termination\n    of litigation usually required ‘a single simple act.’ H.\n6                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    McClintock, Principles of Equity §15, pp. 32–33 (2d\n    ed. 1948). Indeed, there was a ‘historical prejudice of\n    the court of chancery against rendering decrees which\n    called for more than a single affirmative act.’ Id., §61,\n    at 160. And where specific performance of contracts\n    was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree\n    would issue that required ongoing supervision. . . .\n    Compliance with these ‘single act’ mandates could, in\n    addition to being simple, be quick; and once it was\n    achieved the contemnor’s relationship with the court\n    came to an end, at least insofar as the subject of the\n    order was concerned. Once the document was turned\n    over or the land conveyed, the litigant’s obligation to\n    the court, and the court’s coercive power over the liti\n    gant, ceased. . . . The court did not engage in any on\n    going supervision of the litigant’s conduct, nor did its\n    order continue to regulate its behavior.” Mine Work\n    ers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 841–842 (1994) (SCALIA,\n    J., concurring).\n   Structural injunctions depart from that historical prac\ntice, turning judges into long-term administrators of\ncomplex social institutions such as schools, prisons, and\npolice departments. Indeed, they require judges to play a\nrole essentially indistinguishable from the role ordinarily\nplayed by executive officials. Today’s decision not only\naffirms the structural injunction but vastly expands its\nuse, by holding that an entire system is unconstitutional\nbecause it may produce constitutional violations.\n   The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been\ndescribed at great length elsewhere. See, e.g., Lewis,\nsupra, at 385–393 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring); Mis\nsouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 124–133 (1995) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring); Horowitz, Decreeing Organizational\nChange: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983\nDuke L. J. 1265.

The factfinding judges tradition\nally engage in involves the determination of past or pre\nsent facts based (except for a limited set of materials of\nwhich courts may take “judicial notice”) exclusively upon\na closed trial record. That is one reason why a district\njudge’s factual findings are entitled to plain-error review:\nbecause having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better\nposition to evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a\ncold record. In a very limited category of cases, judges\nhave also traditionally been called upon to make some\npredictive judgments: which custody will best serve the\ninterests of the child, for example, or whether a particular\none-shot injunction will remedy the plaintiff’s grievance.\nWhen a judge manages a structural injunction, however,\nhe will inevitably be required to make very broad empiri\ncal predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy\nviews—the sort of predictions regularly made by legis\nlators and executive officials, but inappropriate for the\nThird Branch.\n   This feature of structural injunctions is superbly illus\ntrated by the District Court’s proceeding concerning the\ndecrowding order’s effect on public safety. The PLRA\nrequires that, before granting “[p]rospective relief in [a]\ncivil action with respect to prison conditions,” a court must\n“give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public\nsafety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused\nby the relief.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). Here, the Dis\ntrict Court discharged that requirement by making the\n“factual finding” that “the state has available methods by\nwhich it could readily reduce the prison population to\n137.5% design capacity or less without an adverse impact\non public safety or the operation of the criminal justice\nsystem.” Juris.

It “reject[ed] the testimony that inmates\nreleased early from prison would commit additional new\ncrimes,” id., at 200a, finding that “shortening the length of\nstay through earned credits would give inmates incentives\nto participate in programming designed to lower recidi\nvism,” id., at 204a, and that “slowing the flow of technical\nparole violators to prison, thereby substantially reducing\nthe churning of parolees, would by itself improve both\nthe prison and parole systems, and public safety.” Id., at\n209a. It found that “the diversion of offenders to commu\nnity correctional programs has significant beneficial ef\nfects on public safety,” id., at 214a, and that “additional\nrehabilitative programming would result in a significant\npopulation reduction while improving public safety,” id., at\n216a.\n   The District Court cast these predictions (and the Court\ntoday accepts them) as “factual findings,” made in reliance\non the procession of expert witnesses that testified at trial.\nBecause these “findings” have support in the record, it is\ndifficult to reverse them under a plain-error standard of\nreview. Ante, at 38. And given that the District Court\ndevoted nearly 10 days of trial and 70 pages of its opinion\nto this issue, it is difficult to dispute that the District\nCourt has discharged its statutory obligation to give “sub\nstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety.”\n   But the idea that the three District Judges in this case\nrelied solely on the credibility of the testifying expert\nwitnesses is fanciful. Of course they were relying largely\non their own beliefs about penology and recidivism. And\nof course different district judges, of different policy views,\nwould have “found” that rehabilitation would not work\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand that releasing prisoners would increase the crime\nrate. I am not saying that the District Judges rendered\ntheir factual findings in bad faith. I am saying that it is\nimpossible for judges to make “factual findings” without\ninserting their own policy judgments, when the factual\nfindings are policy judgments. What occurred here is no\nmore judicial factfinding in the ordinary sense than would\nbe the factual findings that deficit spending will not lower\nthe unemployment rate, or that the continued occupation\nof Iraq will decrease the risk of terrorism. Yet, because\nthey have been branded “factual findings” entitled to\ndeferential review, the policy preferences of three District\nJudges now govern the operation of California’s penal\nsystem.\n   It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of pol\nicy judgments as factual findings is not an error pecu-\nliar to this case. It is an unavoidable concomitant of insti\ntutional-reform litigation. When a district court issues an\ninjunction, it must make a factual assessment of the an\nticipated consequences of the injunction. And when the\ninjunction undertakes to restructure a social institution,\nassessing the factual consequences of the injunction is\nnecessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our sys\ntem of government allocates to other government officials.\n   But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges to\nindulge policy preferences. They invite judges to indulge\nincompetent policy preferences. Three years of law school\nand familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents\ngive no insight whatsoever into the management of social\ninstitutions. Thus, in the proceeding below the District\nCourt determined that constitutionally adequate medical\nservices could be provided if the prison population was\n137.5% of design capacity. This was an empirical finding\nit was utterly unqualified to make. Admittedly, the court\ndid not generate that number entirely on its own; it heard\nthe numbers 130% and 145% bandied about by various\n10                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwitnesses and decided to split the difference. But the\nability of judges to spit back or even average-out numbers\nspoon-fed to them by expert witnesses does not render\nthem competent decisionmakers in areas in which they\nare otherwise unqualified.\n   The District Court also relied heavily on the views of the\nReceiver and Special Master, and those reports play a\nstarring role in the Court’s opinion today. The Court notes\nthat “the Receiver and the Special Master filed reports\nstating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to\ntheir efforts” and deems those reports “persuasive evi\ndence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem\nedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least\nrequire vast expenditures of resources by the State.” Ante,\nat 31–32. The use of these reports is even less consonant\nwith the traditional judicial role than the District Court’s\nreliance on the expert testimony at trial. The latter, even\nwhen, as here, it is largely the expression of policy judg\nments, is at least subject to cross-examination. Relying on\nthe un-cross-examined findings of an investigator, sent\ninto the field to prepare a factual report and give sugges\ntions on how to improve the prison system, bears no re\nsemblance to ordinary judicial decisionmaking. It is true\nthat the PLRA contemplates the appointment of Special\nMasters (although not Receivers), but Special Masters are\nauthorized only to “conduct hearings and prepare pro\nposed findings of fact” and “assist in the development of\nremedial plans,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(f)(6). This does not\nauthorize them to make factual findings (unconnected to\nhearings) that are given seemingly wholesale deference.\nNeither the Receiver nor the Special Master was selected\nby California to run its prisons, and the fact that they may\nbe experts in the field of prison reform does not justify the\njudicial imposition of their perspectives on the state.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

As we have previ\nously recognized:\n    “[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly\n    urgent problems of prison administration and re-\n    form. . . . [T]he problems of prisons in America are\n    complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they\n    are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. . . .\n    Running a prison is an inordinately difficult under\n    taking that requires expertise, planning, and the com\n    mitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly\n    within the province of the legislative and executive\n    branches of government. Prison is, moreover, a task\n    that has been committed to the responsibility of those\n    branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a\n    policy of judicial restraint. Where a state penal sys\n    tem is involved, federal courts have . . . additional\n    reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison\n    authorities.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84–85\n    (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   These principles apply doubly to a prisoner-release\norder. As the author of today’s opinion explained earlier\nthis Term, granting a writ of habeas corpus “ ‘disturbs the\nState’s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga\ntion, denies society the right to punish some admitted\noffenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree\nmatched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.’ ”\nHarrington v.

And yet\nhere, the Court affirms an order granting the functional\nequivalent of 46,000 writs of habeas corpus, based on its\npaean to courts’ “substantial flexibility when making these\njudgments.” Ante, at 41. It seems that the Court’s respect\nfor state sovereignty has vanished in the case where it\nmost matters.\n                              II\n   The Court’s opinion includes a bizarre coda noting\nthat “[t]he State may wish to move for modification of the\nthree-judge court’s order to extend the deadline for the\nrequired reduction to five years.” Ante, at 46–47. The Dis\ntrict Court, it says, “may grant such a request provided\nthat the State satisfies necessary and appropriate precon\nditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to\nimplement the plan without undue delay”; and it gives\nvague suggestions of what these preconditions “may in\nclude,” such as “interim benchmarks.” Ante, at 47. It also\ninvites the District Court to “consider whether it is appro\npriate to order the State to begin without delay to develop\na system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reof\nfend,” and informs the State that it “should devise systems\nto select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public\nsafety.” Ibid. (What a good idea!)\n   The legal effect of this passage is unclear—I suspect\nintentionally so. If it is nothing but a polite remainder to\nthe State and to the District Court that the injunction is\nsubject to modification, then it is entirely unnecessary. As\nboth the State and the District Court are undoubtedly\naware, a party is always entitled to move to modify an\nequitable decree, and the PLRA contains an express provi\nsion authorizing District Courts to modify or terminate\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

C. §3626(b).\n   I suspect, however, that this passage is a warning shot\nacross the bow, telling the District Court that it had better\nmodify the injunction if the State requests what we invite\nit to request. Such a warning, if successful, would achieve\nthe benefit of a marginal reduction in the inevitable mur\nders, robberies, and rapes to be committed by the released\ninmates. But it would achieve that at the expense of in\ntellectual bankruptcy, as the Court’s “warning” is en-\ntirely alien to ordinary principles of appellate review of\ninjunctions. When a party moves for modification of\nan injunction, the district court is entitled to rule on that\nmotion first, subject to review for abuse of discretion if it\ndeclines to modify the order. Horne v. Flores, 557 U. S.\n___, ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10, 20). Moreover, when a\ndistrict court enters a new decree with new benchmarks,\nthe selection of those benchmarks is also reviewed under\na deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review—a\npoint the Court appears to recognize. Ante, at 45. Appel\nlate courts are not supposed to “affirm” injunctions while\npreemptively noting that the State “may” request, and the\nDistrict Court “may” grant, a request to extend the State’s\ndeadline to release prisoners by three years based on some\nsuggestions on what appropriate preconditions for such a\nmodification “may” include.\n   Of course what is really happening here is that the\nCourt, overcome by common sense, disapproves of the\nresults reached by the District Court, but cannot remedy\nthem (it thinks) by applying ordinary standards of appel\nlate review. It has therefore selected a solution unknown\nin our legal system: A deliberately ambiguous set of sug\ngestions on how to modify the injunction, just deferential\nenough so that it can say with a straight face that it is\n“affirming,” just stern enough to put the District Court on\nnotice that it will likely get reversed if it does not follow\nthem. In doing this, the Court has aggrandized itself,\n14                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ngrasping authority that appellate courts are not supposed\nto have, and using it to enact a compromise solution with\nno legal basis other than the Court’s say-so. That we are\ndriven to engage in these extralegal activities should be a\nsign that the entire project of permitting district courts to\nrun prison systems is misbegotten.\n  But perhaps I am being too unkind. The Court, or at\nleast a majority of the Court’s majority, must be aware\nthat the judges of the District Court are likely to call its\nbluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly be an\nabuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State’s proposed\nmodifications in an injunction that has just been approved\n(affirmed) in its present form. An injunction, after all,\ndoes not have to be perfect; only good enough for govern\nment work, which the Court today says this is. So perhaps\nthe coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the\nhands—making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible\nthings sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous\norder do happen, they will be none of this Court’s respon\nsibility. After all, did we not want, and indeed even sug\ngest, something better?\n                              III\n   In view of the incoherence of the Eighth Amendment\nclaim at the core of this case, the nonjudicial features of\ninstitutional reform litigation that this case exemplifies,\nand the unique concerns associated with mass prisoner\nreleases, I do not believe this Court can affirm this injunc\ntion. I will state my approach briefly: In my view, a court\nmay not order a prisoner’s release unless it determines\nthat the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his consti\ntutional rights, and that his release, and no other relief,\nwill remedy that violation. Thus, if the court determines\nthat a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally\nrequired medical treatment, and the release of that pris\noner (and no other remedy) would enable him to obtain\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   15\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmedical treatment, then the court can order his release;\nbut a court may not order the release of prisoners who\nhave suffered no violations of their constitutional rights,\nmerely to make it less likely that that will happen to them\nin the future.\n  This view follows from the PLRA’s text that I discussed\nat the outset, 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). “[N]arrowly\ndrawn” means that the relief applies only to the “particu\nlar [prisoner] or [prisoners]” whose constitutional rights\nare violated; “extends no further than necessary” means\nthat prisoners whose rights are not violated will not obtain\nrelief; and “least intrusive means necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right” means that no other relief is\navailable.*\n  I acknowledge that this reading of the PLRA would se\nverely limit the circumstances under which a court could\nissue structural injunctions to remedy allegedly unconsti\ntutional prison conditions, although it would not eliminate\nthem entirely. If, for instance, a class representing all\nprisoners in a particular institution alleged that the tem\nperature in their cells was so cold as to violate the Eighth\nAmendment, or that they were deprived of all exercise\ntime, a court could enter a prisonwide injunction ordering\nthat the temperature be raised or exercise time be pro\nvided. Still, my approach may invite the objection that the\nPLRA appears to contemplate structural injunctions in\ngeneral and mass prisoner-release orders in particular.\nThe statute requires courts to “give substantial weight to\n——————\n  * Any doubt on this last score, at least as far as prisoner-release or\nders are concerned, is eliminated by §3626(a)(3)(E) of the statute, which\nprovides that to enter a prisoner-release order the court must find\n  “by clear and convincing evidence that—\n  (i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right;\nand\n  (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.”\n16                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nany adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a\ncriminal justice system caused by the relief” and author\nizes them to appoint Special Masters, §3626 (a)(1)(A), (f),\nprovisions that seem to presuppose the possibility of a\nstructural remedy. It also sets forth criteria under which\ncourts may issue orders that have “the purpose or effect of\nreducing or limiting the prisoner population,” §3626(g)(4).\n   I do not believe that objection carries the day. In addi\ntion to imposing numerous limitations on the ability of\ndistrict courts to order injunctive relief with respect to\nprison conditions, the PLRA states that “[n]othing in this\nsection shall be construed to . . . repeal or detract from\notherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of\nthe courts.” §3626(a)(1)(C). The PLRA is therefore best\nunderstood as an attempt to constrain the discretion of\ncourts issuing structural injunctions—not as a mandate\nfor their use. For the reasons I have outlined, structural\ninjunctions, especially prisoner-release orders, raise grave\nseparation-of-powers concerns and veer significantly from\nthe historical role and institutional capability of courts. It\nis appropriate to construe the PLRA so as to constrain\ncourts from entering injunctive relief that would exceed\nthat role and capability.\n                        *     *    *\n  The District Court’s order that California release 46,000\nprisoners extends “further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or\nplaintiffs” who have been denied needed medical care. 18\nU. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). It is accordingly forbidden by the\nPLRA—besides defying all sound conception of the proper\nrole of judges.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Decisions regarding\nstate prisons have profound public safety and financial\nimplications, and the States are generally free to make\nthese decisions as they choose. See Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 85 (1987).\n  The Eighth Amendment imposes an important—but\nlimited—restraint on state authority in this field. The\nEighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from de-\npriving inmates of “the minimal civilized measure of life’s\nnecessities.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 347\n(1981). Federal courts have the responsibility to ensure\nthat this constitutional standard is met, but undesirable\nprison conditions that do not violate the Constitution are\nbeyond the federal courts’ reach.\n  In this case, a three-judge court exceeded its authority\nunder the Constitution and the PLRA. The court ordered\na radical reduction in the California prison population\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwithout finding that the current population level violates\nthe Constitution.\n   Two cases were before the three-judge court, and neither\ntargeted the general problem of overcrowding. Indeed, the\nplaintiffs in one of those cases readily acknowledge that\nthe current population level is not itself unconstitutional.\nBrief for Coleman Appellees 56. Both of the cases were\nbrought not on behalf of all inmates subjected to over\ncrowding, but rather in the interests of much more limited\nclasses of prisoners, namely, those needing mental health\ntreatment and those with other serious medical needs.\nBut these cases were used as a springboard to implement\na criminal justice program far different from that chosen\nby the state legislature. Instead of crafting a remedy to\nattack the specific constitutional violations that were\nfound—which related solely to prisoners in the two plain\ntiff classes—the lower court issued a decree that will at\nbest provide only modest help to those prisoners but that\nis very likely to have a major and deleterious effect on\npublic safety.\n   The three-judge court ordered the premature release of\napproximately 46,000 criminals—the equivalent of three\nArmy divisions.\n   The approach taken by the three-judge court flies in the\nface of the PLRA. Contrary to the PLRA, the court’s rem\nedy is not narrowly tailored to address proven and ongoing\nconstitutional violations. And the three-judge court vio\nlated the PLRA’s critical command that any court con\ntemplating a prisoner release order must give “substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety.” 18\nU. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). The three-judge court would have\nus believe that the early release of 46,000 inmates will not\nimperil—and will actually improve—public safety. Juris.\nStatement App., O.

First, the three-judge court improperly refused\nto consider evidence concerning present conditions in the\nCalifornia prison system. Second, the court erred in hold\ning that no remedy short of a massive prisoner release can\nbring the California system into compliance with the\nEighth Amendment. Third, the court gave inadequate\nweight to the impact of its decree on public safety.\n                                I\n   Both the PLRA and general principles concerning in\njunctive relief dictate that a prisoner release order cannot\nproperly be issued unless the relief is necessary to remedy\nan ongoing violation. Under the PLRA, a prisoner release\nmay be decreed only if crowding “is the primary cause” of\nan Eighth Amendment violation and only if no other re\nlief “will remedy” the violation. §3626(a)(3)(E) (emphasis\nadded). This language makes it clear that proof of past\nviolations alone is insufficient to justify a court-ordered\nprisoner release.\n   Similarly, in cases not governed by the PLRA, we have\nheld that an inmate seeking an injunction to prevent a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment must show that prison\nofficials are “knowingly and unreasonably disregarding an\nobjectively intolerable risk of harm, and that they will\ncontinue to do so . . . into the future.” Farmer v. Brennan,\n511 U. S. 825, 846 (1994). The “deliberate indifference”\nneeded to establish an Eighth Amendment violation must\nbe examined “in light of the prison authorities’ current\nattitudes and conduct,” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25,\n36 (1993), which means “their attitudes and conduct at the\ntime suit is brought and persisting thereafter,” Farmer,\nsupra, at 845.\n   For these reasons, the propriety of the relief ordered\nhere cannot be assessed without ascertaining the nature\nand scope of any ongoing constitutional violations. Proof\n4                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nof past violations will not do; nor is it sufficient simply\nto establish that some violations continue. The scope of\npermissible relief depends on the scope of any continuing\nviolations, and therefore it was essential for the three\njudge court to make a reliable determination of the extent\nof any violations as of the time its release order was is\nsued. Particularly in light of the radical nature of its\nchosen remedy, nothing less than an up-to-date assess\nment was tolerable.\n   The three-judge court, however, relied heavily on out\ndated information and findings and refused to permit\nCalifornia to introduce new evidence. Despite evidence of\nimprovement,1 the three-judge court relied on old findings\nmade by the single-judge courts, see Juris. App. 76a–77a,\nincluding a finding made 14 years earlier, see id., at 170a\n(citing Coleman v.

Instead, it based its remedy on constitutional defi\nciencies that, in its own words, were found “years ago.”\nIbid.2\n   The three-judge court justified its refusal to receive up\nto-date evidence on the ground that the State had not filed\na motion to terminate prospective relief under a provision\nof the PLRA, §3626(b). See Juris. App. 77a. Today’s\nopinion for this Court endorses that reasoning, ante, at 26.\nBut the State’s opportunity to file such a motion did not\neliminate the three-judge court’s obligation to ensure that\nits relief was necessary to remedy ongoing violations.3\nMoreover, the lower court’s reasoning did not properly\ntake into account the potential significance of the evidence\nthat the State sought to introduce. Even if that evidence\ndid not show that all violations had ceased—the showing\nneeded to obtain the termination of relief under\n§3626(b)—that evidence was highly relevant with respect\nto the nature and scope of permissible relief.4\n——————\n  2 For   this reason, it is simply not the case that “evidence of current\nconditions . . . informed every aspect of the judgment of the three-judge\ncourt,” as the majority insists, ante, at 25.\n   3 Because the Ninth Circuit places the burden on the State to prove\n\nthe absence of an ongoing violation when it moves to terminate pro\nspective relief, see Gilmore v. California, 220 F. 3d 987, 1007 (CA9\n2000), even if the State had unsuccessfully moved to terminate pro\nspective relief under 18 U. S. C. §3626(b), there would still have been no\ndetermination that plaintiffs had carried their burden under the PLRA\nto establish by clear and convincing evidence that a prisoner release\norder is necessary to correct an ongoing rights violation.\n   4 It is also no answer to say, as the Court now does, ante, at 26, that\n\nthe State had the opportunity to resist the convening of the three-judge\ncourt on the ground that there were no unremedied constitutional\nviolations as of that date. See §3626(a)(3)(A)(i). The District Courts\ngranted plaintiffs’ motions to convene a three-judge court in 2007, three\nyears before the remedial decree here was issued. Thus, the conditions\nin the prison system as of the date when the decree was issued were not\nnecessarily the same as those that existed before the three-judge court\nproceedings began. Moreover, as noted above, even if all of the viola\ntions in the system had not been cured at the time of the remedial\n6                          BROWN v.

The majority rea\nsons that the three-judge court had closed the book on the\nquestion of constitutional violations and had turned to\nthe question of remedy. Ibid. As noted, however, the ex-\ntent of any continuing constitutional violations was highly\nrelevant to the question of remedy.\n   The majority also countenances the three-judge court’s\nreliance on dated findings. The majority notes that the\nlower court considered recent reports by the Special Mas\nter and Receiver, ante, at 18–19, but the majority provides\nno persuasive justification for the lower court’s refusal to\nreceive hard, up-to-date evidence about any continuing\nviolations. With the safety of the people of California in\nthe balance, the record on this issue should not have been\nclosed.\n   The majority repeats the lower court’s error of reciting\nstatistics that are clearly out of date. The Court notes\nthe lower court’s finding that as of 2005 “an inmate in one\nof California’s prisons needlessly dies every six to seven\ndays.” See ante, at 9. Yet by the date of the trial before\nthe three-judge court, the death rate had been trending\ndownward for 10 quarters, App. 2257, and the number of\nlikely preventable deaths fell from 18 in 2006 to 3 in 2007,\na decline of 83 percent.5 Between 2001 and 2007, the\n——————\ndecree, an accurate assessment of conditions as of that date was essen\ntial in order to ensure that the relief did not sweep more broadly than\nnecessary.\n   5 2008 Death Reviews 22.

As\nthe majority acknowledges, even this class of cases is now dramatically\ndiminished, and the three-judge court must take the current conditions\ninto account when revising its remedy going forward.

But\nsuch anecdotal evidence cannot be given undue weight in\nassessing the current state of the California system. The\npopulation of the California prison system (156,000 in\nmates at the time of trial) is larger than that of many\nmedium-sized cities,7 and an examination of the medical\ncare provided to the residents of many such cities would\nlikely reveal cases in which grossly deficient treatment\nwas provided. Instances of past mistreatment in the\nCalifornia system are relevant, but prospective relief must\nbe tailored to present and future, not past, conditions.\n                             II\n  Under the PLRA, a court may not grant any prospective\nrelief unless the court finds that the relief is narrowly\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\n“violation of [a] Federal right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nright.” §3626(a)(1)(A).

Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 419–420 (1977) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Here, the majority and the court below maintain that no\nremedy short of a massive release of prisoners from the\ngeneral prison population can remedy the State’s failure to\nprovide constitutionally adequate health care. This argu\nment is implausible on its face and is not supported by the\nrequisite clear and convincing evidence.\n   It is instructive to consider the list of deficiencies in the\nCalifornia prison health care system that are highlighted\nin today’s opinion for this Court and in the opinion of the\ncourt below. The deficiencies noted by the majority here\ninclude the following: “ ‘[e]xam tables and counter tops,\nwhere prisoners with . . . communicable diseases are\ntreated, [are] not routinely disinfected,’ ” ante, at 10; medi\ncal facilities “ ‘are in an abysmal state of disrepair,’ ” ibid.;\nmedications “ ‘are too often not available when needed,’ ”\nante, at 10–11; “ ‘[b]asic medical equipment is often not\navailable or used,’ ” ante, at 10; prisons “would ‘hire any\ndoctor who had “a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ’ ”\nibid.; and medical and mental health staff positions have\nhigh vacancy rates, ante, at 20. The three-judge court\npointed to similar problems. See Juris. App. 93a–121a\n(citing, among other things, staffing vacancies, too few\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Without\ntaking that radical and dangerous step, exam tables and\ncounter tops cannot properly be disinfected? None of the\nsystem’s dilapidated facilities can be repaired? Needed\nmedications and equipment cannot be purchased and\nused? Staff vacancies cannot be filled? The qualifica\ntions of prison physicians cannot be improved? A better\nrecords management system cannot be developed and\nimplemented?\n   I do not dispute that general overcrowding contributes to\nmany of the California system’s healthcare problems. But\nit by no means follows that reducing overcrowding is the\nonly or the best or even a particularly good way to allevi\nate those problems. Indeed, it is apparent that the pris\noner release ordered by the court below is poorly suited for\nthis purpose. The release order is not limited to prisoners\nneeding substantial medical care but instead calls for a\nreduction in the system’s overall population. Under the\norder issued by the court below, it is not necessary for\na single prisoner in the plaintiff classes to be released.\nAlthough some class members will presumably be among\nthose who are discharged, the decrease in the number of\nprisoners needing mental health treatment or other forms\nof extensive medical care will be much smaller than the\ntotal number of prisoners released, and thus the release\nwill produce at best only a modest improvement in the\nburden on the medical care system.\n   The record bears this out. The Special Master stated\ndramatically that even releasing 100,000 inmates (two\nthirds of the California system’s entire inmate popula\ntion!) would leave the problem of providing mental health\ntreatment “largely unmitigated.” App. 487. Similarly, the\nReceiver proclaimed that “ ‘those . . . who think that popu\n10                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlation controls will solve California’s prison health care\nproblems . . . are simply wrong.’ ” Juris. App. 282a.\n   The State proposed several remedies other than a mas\nsive release of prisoners, but the three-judge court, seem\ningly intent on attacking the broader problem of general\novercrowding, rejected all of the State’s proposals. In\ndoing so, the court made three critical errors.\n   First, the court did not assess those proposals and other\nremedies in light of conditions proved to exist at the time\nthe release order was framed. Had more recent evidence\nbeen taken into account, a less extreme remedy might\nhave been shown to be sufficient.\n   Second, the court failed to distinguish between condi\ntions that fall below the level that may be desirable as a\nmatter of public policy and conditions that do not meet the\nminimum level mandated by the Constitution. To take\none example, the court criticized the California system\nbecause prison doctors must conduct intake exams in\nareas separated by folding screens rather than in separate\nrooms, creating conditions that “do not allow for appropri\nate confidentiality.” Id., at 88a. But the legitimate pri\nvacy expectations of inmates are greatly diminished, see\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 525–526 (1984), and this\nCourt has never suggested that the failure to provide\nprivate consultation rooms in prisons amounts to cruel\nand unusual punishment.\n   Third, the court rejected alternatives that would not\nhave provided “ ‘immediate’ ” relief. Juris. App. 148a. But\nnothing in the PLRA suggests that public safety may be\nsacrificed in order to implement an immediate remedy\nrather than a less dangerous one that requires a more\nextended but reasonable period of time.\n   If the three-judge court had not made these errors, it is\nentirely possible that an adequate but less drastic reme\ndial plan could have been crafted. Without up-to-date\ninformation, it is not possible to specify what such a plan\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmight provide, and in any event, that is not a task that\nshould be undertaken in the first instance by this Court.\nBut possible components of such a plan are not hard to\nidentify.\n   Many of the problems noted above plainly could be\naddressed without releasing prisoners and without in\ncurring the costs associated with a large-scale prison\nconstruction program. Sanitary procedures could be im\nproved; sufficient supplies of medicine and medical\nequipment could be purchased; an adequate system of\nrecords management could be implemented; and the num\nber of medical and other staff positions could be increased.\nSimilarly, it is hard to believe that staffing vacancies\ncannot be reduced or eliminated and that the qualifica\ntions of medical personnel cannot be improved by any\nmeans short of a massive prisoner release. Without spe\ncific findings backed by hard evidence, this Court should\nnot accept the counterintuitive proposition that these\nproblems cannot be ameliorated by increasing salaries,\nimproving working conditions, and providing better train\ning and monitoring of performance.\n   While the cost of a large-scale construction program\nmay well exceed California’s current financial capabilities,\na more targeted program, involving the repair and per\nhaps the expansion of current medical facilities (as op\nposed to general prison facilities), might be manageable.\nAfter all, any remedy in this case, including the new pro\ngrams associated with the prisoner release order and\nother proposed relief now before the three-judge court, will\nnecessarily involve some state expenditures.\n   Measures such as these might be combined with tar\ngeted reductions in critical components of the State’s\nprison population. A certain number of prisoners in the\nclasses on whose behalf the two cases were brought might\nbe transferred to out-of-state facilities. The three-judge\ncourt rejected the State’s proposal to transfer prisoners to\n12                          BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nout-of-state facilities in part because the number of pro\nposed transfers was too small. See id., at 160a. See also\nante, at 30. But this reasoning rested on the court’s insis\ntence on a reduction in the State’s general prison popula\ntion rather than the two plaintiff classes.\n    When the State proposed to make a targeted transfer of\nprisoners in one of the plaintiff classes (i.e., prisoners\nneeding mental health treatment), one of the District\nJudges blocked the transfers for fear that the out-of-state\nfacilities would not provide a sufficiently high level of care.\nSee App. 434–440. The District Judge even refused to\nallow out-of-state transfers for prisoners who volunteered\nfor relocation. See id., at 437. And the court did this even\nthough there was not even an allegation, let alone clear\nevidence, that the States to which these prisoners would\nhave been sent were violating the Eighth Amendment.\n    The District Judge presumed that the receiving States\nmight fail to provide constitutionally adequate care, but\n“ ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts\npresume that [public officers] have properly discharged\ntheir official duties.’ ” United States v. Armstrong, 517\nU. S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting United States v. Chemical\nFoundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14–15 (1926)); Postal Service\nv. Gregory, 534 U.

But the PLRA does not apply when the State\nvoluntarily conducts such transfers, as it has sought to do.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. 2915:12–15 (Feb. 3, 2009). The three-judge\ncourt rejected this proposal, and its response exemplified\nwhat went wrong in this case. One judge complained that\nthis remedy would be deficient because it would protect\nonly the members of the plaintiff classes. The judge\nstated:\n    “The only thing is we would be protecting the class\n    members. And maybe that’s the appropriate thing to\n    do. I mean, that’s what this case is about, but it\n    would be . . . difficult for me to say yes, and the hell\n    with everybody else.” Id., at 2915:23–2916:2.\nOverstepping his authority, the judge was not content to\nprovide relief for the classes of plaintiffs on whose behalf\nthe suit before him was brought. Nor was he content to\nremedy the only constitutional violations that were\nproved—which concerned the treatment of the members of\nthose classes. Instead, the judge saw it as his responsibil\nity to attack the general problem of overcrowding.\n                             III\n  Before ordering any prisoner release, the PLRA com\nmands a court to “give substantial weight to any adverse\nimpact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system caused by the relief.” §3626(a)(1)(A). This\nprovision unmistakably reflects Congress’ view that pris\noner release orders are inherently risky.\n  In taking this view, Congress was well aware of the\nimpact of previous prisoner release orders. The prisoner\nrelease program carried out a few years earlier in Phila\ndelphia is illustrative. In the early 1990’s, federal courts\nenforced a cap on the number of inmates in the Philadel\nphia prison system, and thousands of inmates were set\n14                         BROWN v.

Although efforts were made to release only those\nprisoners who were least likely to commit violent crimes,\nthat attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful. During an\n18-month period, the Philadelphia police rearrested thou\nsands of these prisoners for committing 9,732 new crimes.\nThose defendants were charged with 79 murders, 90\nrapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 robberies, 701 burglaries, and\n2,748 thefts, not to mention thousands of drug offenses.9\nMembers of Congress were well aware of this experience.10\n  Despite the record of past prisoner release orders, the\nthree-judge court in this case concluded that loosing\n46,000 criminals would not produce a tally like that in\nPhiladelphia and would actually improve public safety.\nJuris. App. 248a–249a. In reaching this debatable con\nclusion, the three-judge court relied on the testimony of\nselected experts, id., at 248a, and the majority now defers\nto what it characterizes as the lower court’s findings of\nfact on this controversial public policy issue, ante, at 15,\n19–20, 24.\n  This is a fundamental and dangerous error.

According to that court, “overwhelming\nevidence” supported this purported finding.

After all, the sharp in\ncrease in the California prison population that the three\njudge court lamented, see id., at 254a, has been accompa\nnied by an equally sharp decrease in violent crime.11\nThese California trends mirror similar developments at\nthe national level,12 and “[t]here is a general consensus\nthat the decline in crime is, at least in part, due to more\nand longer prison sentences.”13 If increased incarceration\n——————\n  11 From 1992 to 2009, the violent crime rate in California per 100,000\n\nresidents fell from 1,119.7 to 472.0—a decrease of 57.8 percent.

But testimony pointing out the diffi\nculty of assessing the consequences of this drastic remedy\nwould have been valued by a careful court duly mindful of\nthe overriding need to guard public safety.\n   The three-judge court acknowledged that it “ha[d] not\nevaluated the public safety impact of each individual\nelement” of the population reduction plan it ordered the\nState to implement.

Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 23, 2011\nCalifornia’s prisons are designed to house a population just under\n  80,000, but at the time of the decision under review the population\n  was almost double that. The resulting conditions are the subject of\n  two federal class actions. In Coleman v. Brown, filed in 1990, the\n  District Court found that prisoners with serious mental illness do not\n  receive minimal, adequate care. A Special Master appointed to over\n  see remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental\n  health care in California’s prisons was deteriorating due to increased\n  overcrowding. In Plata v. Brown, filed in 2001, the State conceded\n  that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth\n  Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction. But\n  when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the\n  court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts. Three years\n  later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by over\n  crowding. Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and\n  mental health care could not be achieved without reducing over\n  crowding, the Coleman and Plata plaintiffs moved their respective\n  District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the\n  Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in\n  the prison population. The judges in both actions granted the re\n  quest, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge\n  court. After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact,\n  the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5%\n  of design capacity within two years. Finding that the prison popula\n  tion would have to be reduced if capacity could not be increased\n  through new construction, the court ordered the State to formulate a\n  compliance plan and submit it for court approval.\n2                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. The court-mandated population limit is necessary to remedy the\n violation of prisoners’ constitutional rights and is authorized by the\n PLRA. Pp. 12–41.\n       (a) If a prison deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including\n adequate medical care, the courts have a responsibility to remedy the\n resulting Eighth Amendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437\n U. S. 678, 687, n. 9. They must consider a range of options, including\n the appointment of special masters or receivers, the possibility of\n consent decrees, and orders limiting a prison’s population. Under the\n PLRA, only a three-judge court may limit a prison population. 18\n U. S. C. §3626(a)(3). Before convening such a court, a district court\n must have entered an order for less intrusive relief that failed to\n remedy the constitutional violation and must have given the defen\n dant a reasonable time to comply with its prior orders.\n §3626(a)(3)(A). Once convened, the three-judge court must find by\n clear and convincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of\n the violation” and “no other relief will remedy [the] violation,”\n §3626(a)(3)(E); and that the relief is “narrowly drawn, extends no fur\n ther than necessary. . . , and is the least intrusive means necessary to\n correct the violation,” §3626(a)(1)(A). The court must give “substan\n tial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of\n a criminal justice system caused by the relief.” Ibid. Its legal deter\n minations are reviewed de novo, but its factual findings are reviewed\n for clear error. Pp. 12–15.\n       (b) The Coleman and Plata courts acted reasonably in convening\n a three-judge court. Pp. 15–19.\n         (1) The merits of the decision to convene are properly before\n this Court, which has exercised its 28 U. S. C. §1253 jurisdiction to\n determine the authority of a court below, including whether a three\n judge court was properly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employ\n ees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12. Pp. 15–16.\n         (2) Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)’s previous order requirement was\n satisfied in Coleman by the Special Master’s 1995 appointment and\n in Plata by the 2002 approval of a consent decree and stipulated in\n junction. Both orders were intended to remedy constitutional viola\n tions and were given ample time to succeed—12 years in Coleman,\n and 5 years in Plata.               Contrary to the State’s claim,\n §3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)’s reasonable time requirement did not require the\n District Courts to give more time for subsequent remedial efforts to\n succeed. Such a reading would in effect require courts to impose a\n moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population limit,\n which would delay an eventual remedy, prolong the courts’ involve\n ment, and serve neither the State nor the prisoners. The Coleman\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nand Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to\nbuild new facilities and hire new staff would achieve a remedy, given\nthe ongoing deficiencies recently reported by both the Special Master\nand the Receiver. Pp. 16–19.\n     (c) The three-judge court did not err in finding that “crowding\n[was] the primary cause of the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(i). Pp. 19–\n29.\n        (1) The trial record documents the severe impact of burgeoning\ndemand on the provision of care. The evidence showed that there\nwere high vacancy rates for medical and mental health staff, e.g.,\n20% for surgeons and 54.1% for psychiatrists; that these numbers\nunderstated the severity of the crisis because the State has not budg\neted sufficient staff to meet demand; and that even if vacant positions\ncould be filled, there would be insufficient space for the additional\nstaff. Such a shortfall contributes to significant delays in treating\nmentally ill prisoners, who are housed in administrative segregation\nfor extended periods while awaiting transfer to scarce mental health\ntreatment beds. There are also backlogs of up to 700 prisoners wait\ning to see a doctor for physical care. Crowding creates unsafe and\nunsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and\nmental health care. It also promotes unrest and violence and can\ncause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and develop\novert symptoms. Increased violence requires increased reliance on\nlockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede the effective\ndelivery of care. Overcrowding’s effects are particularly acute in\nprison reception centers, which process 140,000 new or returning\nprisoners annually, and which house some prisoners for their entire\nincarceration period. Numerous experts testified that crowding is the\nprimary cause of the constitutional violations. Pp. 19–24.\n        (2) Contrary to the State’s claim, the three-judge court prop\nerly admitted, cited, and considered evidence of current prison condi\ntions as relevant to the issues before it. Expert witnesses based their\nconclusions on recent observations of prison conditions; the court ad\nmitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Receiver and Spe\ncial Master; and both parties presented testimony related to current\nconditions. The court’s orders cutting off discovery a few months be\nfore trial and excluding evidence not pertinent to the issue whether a\npopulation limit is appropriate under the PLRA were within the\ncourt’s sound discretion. Orderly trial management may require dis\ncovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litigation of the\nmerits and the remedy. The State points to no significant evidence\nthat it was unable to present and that would have changed the out\ncome here. Pp. 24–26.\n        (3) It was permissible for the three-judge court to conclude that\n4                            BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    overcrowding was the “primary,” but not the only, cause of the viola\n    tions, and that reducing crowding would not entirely cure the viola\n    tions. This understanding of the primary cause requirement is con\n    sistent with the PLRA. Had Congress intended to require that\n    crowding be the only cause, the PLRA would have said so. Pp. 26–29.\n         (d) The evidence supports the three-judge court’s finding that “no\n    other relief [would] remedy the violation,” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii). The\n    State’s claim that out-of-state transfers provide a less restrictive al\n    ternative to a population limit must fail because requiring transfers\n    is a population limit under the PLRA. Even if they could be regarded\n    as a less restrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no evi\n    dence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to relieve over\n    crowding. The court also found no realistic possibility that California\n    could build itself out of this crisis, particularly given the State’s ongo\n    ing fiscal problems. Further, it rejected additional hiring as a realis\n    tic alternative, since the prison system was chronically understaffed\n    and would have insufficient space were adequate personnel retained.\n    The court also did not err when it concluded that, absent a population\n    reduction, the Receiver’s and Special Master’s continued efforts\n    would not achieve a remedy. Their reports are persuasive evidence\n    that, with no reduction, any remedy might prove unattainable and\n    would at the very least require vast expenditures by the State. The\n    State asserts that these measures would succeed if combined, but a\n    long history of failed remedial orders, together with substantial evi\n    dence of overcrowding’s deleterious effects on the provision of care,\n    compels a different conclusion here. Pp. 29–33.\n         (e) The prospective relief ordered here was narrowly drawn, ex\n    tended no further than necessary to correct the violation, and was the\n    least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation. Pp. 33–41.\n           (1) The population limit does not fail narrow tailoring simply\n    because prisoners beyond the plaintiff class will have to be released\n    through parole or sentencing reform in order to meet the required re\n    duction. While narrow tailoring requires a “ ‘ “fit” between the [rem\n    edy’s] ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,’ ” Board\n    of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480, a narrow\n    and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional violation is not in\n    valid simply because it will have collateral effects. Nor does the\n    PLRA require that result. The order gives the State flexibility to de\n    termine who should be released, and the State could move the three\n    judge court to modify its terms. The order also is not overbroad be\n    cause it encompasses the entire prison system, rather than sepa\n    rately assessing each institution’s need for a population limit. The\n    Coleman court found a systemwide violation, and the State stipulated\n    to systemwide relief in Plata. Assuming no constitutional violation\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nresults, some facilities may retain populations in excess of the 137.5%\nlimit provided others fall sufficiently below it so the system as a\nwhole remains in compliance with the order. This will afford the\nState flexibility to accommodate differences between institutions.\nThe order may shape or control the State’s authority in the realm of\nprison administration, but it leaves much to the State’s discretion.\nThe order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a constitutional vio\nlation. The State may move the three-judge court to modify its order,\nbut it has proposed no realistic alternative remedy at this time.\nPp. 33–36.\n        (2) The three-judge court gave “substantial weight” to any po\ntential adverse impact on public safety from its order. The PLRA’s\n“substantial weight” requirement does not require the court to certify\nthat its order has no possible adverse impact on the public. Here,\nstatistical evidence showed that prison populations had been lowered\nwithout adversely affecting public safety in some California counties,\nseveral States, and Canada. The court found that various available\nmethods of reducing overcrowding—good time credits and diverting\nlow-risk offenders to community programs—would have little or no\nimpact on public safety, and its order took account of such concerns\nby giving the State substantial flexibility to select among the means\nof reducing overcrowding. The State complains that the court ap\nproved the State’s population reduction plan without considering\nwhether its specific measures would substantially threaten public\nsafety. But the court left state officials the choice of how best to com\nply and was not required to second-guess their exercise of discretion.\nDevelopments during the pendency of this appeal, when the State\nhas begun to reduce the prison population, support the conclusion\nthat a reduction can be accomplished without an undue negative ef\nfect on public safety. Pp. 37–41.\n   2. The three-judge court’s order, subject to the State’s right to seek\nits modification in appropriate circumstances, must be affirmed.\nPp. 41–48.\n      (a) To comply with the PLRA, a court must set a population limit\nat the highest level consistent with an efficacious remedy, and it\nmust order the population reduction to be achieved in the shortest\nperiod of time reasonably consistent with public safety. Pp. 41–42.\n      (b) The three-judge court’s conclusion that the prison population\nshould be capped at 137.5% of design capacity was not clearly errone\nous. The court concluded that the evidence supported a limit be\ntween the 130% limit supported by expert testimony and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons and the 145% limit recommended by the State\nCorrections Independent Review Panel. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring\nrequirement is satisfied so long as such equitable, remedial judg\n6                            BROWN v.

Pp. 42–44.\n         (c) The three-judge court did not err in providing a 2-year dead\n    line for relief, especially in light of the State’s failure to contest the\n    issue at trial. The State has not asked this Court to extend the dead\n    line, but the three-judge court has the authority, and responsibility,\n    to amend its order as warranted by the exercise of sound discretion.\n    Proper respect for the State and for its governmental processes re\n    quire that court to exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State consid\n    erable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans that will\n    promptly and effectively correct the violations consistent with public\n    safety. The court may, e.g., grant a motion to extend the deadline if\n    the State meets appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that\n    the plan will be implemented without undue delay. Such observa\n    tions reflect the fact that the existing order, like all ongoing equitable\n    relief, must remain open to appropriate modification, and are not in\n    tended to cast doubt on the validity of the order’s basic premise.\n    Pp. 44–48.\nAffirmed.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which GINSBURG,\nBREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

The violations have persisted\nfor years. They remain uncorrected. The appeal comes to\nthis Court from a three-judge District Court order direct\ning California to remedy two ongoing violations of the\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a guarantee\nbinding on the States by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The violations are the subject of\ntwo class actions in two Federal District Courts. The first\ninvolves the class of prisoners with serious mental disor\nders. That case is Coleman v. Brown. The second involves\nprisoners with serious medical conditions. That case is\nPlata v. Brown. The order of the three-judge District\nCourt is applicable to both cases.\n   After years of litigation, it became apparent that a\nremedy for the constitutional violations would not be ef\nfective absent a reduction in the prison system popula\ntion. The authority to order release of prisoners as a\nremedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amend\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court,\nnot a single-judge district court. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). In\naccordance with that rule, the Coleman and Plata District\nJudges independently requested that a three-judge court\nbe convened. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit convened a three-judge court composed\nof the Coleman and Plata District Judges and a third,\nNinth Circuit Judge. Because the two cases are interre\nlated, their limited consolidation for this purpose has a\ncertain utility in avoiding conflicting decrees and aiding\njudicial consideration and enforcement. The State in this\nCourt has not objected to consolidation, although the State\ndoes argue that the three-judge court was prematurely\nconvened. The State also objects to the substance of the\nthree-judge court order, which requires the State to reduce\novercrowding in its prisons.\n   The appeal presents the question whether the remedial\norder issued by the three-judge court is consistent with\nrequirements and procedures set forth in a congressional\nstatute, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA).\n18 U. S. C. §3626; see Appendix A, infra. The order leaves\nthe choice of means to reduce overcrowding to the discre\ntion of state officials. But absent compliance through new\nconstruction, out-of-state transfers, or other means—or\nmodification of the order upon a further showing by the\nState—the State will be required to release some number\nof prisoners before their full sentences have been served.\nHigh recidivism rates must serve as a warning that mis\ntaken or premature release of even one prisoner can cause\ninjury and harm. The release of prisoners in large num\nbers—assuming the State finds no other way to comply\nwith the order—is a matter of undoubted, grave concern.\n   At the time of trial, California’s correctional facilities\nheld some 156,000 persons. This is nearly double the\nnumber that California’s prisons were designed to hold,\nand California has been ordered to reduce its prison popu\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlation to 137.5% of design capacity. By the three-judge\ncourt’s own estimate, the required population reduction\ncould be as high as 46,000 persons. Although the State\nhas reduced the population by at least 9,000 persons dur\ning the pendency of this appeal, this means a further\nreduction of 37,000 persons could be required. As will be\nnoted, the reduction need not be accomplished in an indis\ncriminate manner or in these substantial numbers if sat\nisfactory, alternate remedies or means for compliance\nare devised. The State may employ measures, including\ngood-time credits and diversion of low-risk offenders and\ntechnical parole violators to community-based programs,\nthat will mitigate the order’s impact. The population\nreduction potentially required is nevertheless of unprece\ndented sweep and extent.\n   Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting\nfrom these serious constitutional violations. For years the\nmedical and mental health care provided by California’s\nprisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional re\nquirements and has failed to meet prisoners’ basic health\nneeds. Needless suffering and death have been the well\ndocumented result. Over the whole course of years during\nwhich this litigation has been pending, no other remedies\nhave been found to be sufficient. Efforts to remedy the\nviolation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in\nCalifornia’s prison system. Short term gains in the provi\nsion of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of\nsevere and pervasive overcrowding.\n   Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of\nprison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity\nof medical and mental health facilities; and created unsan\nitary and unsafe conditions that make progress in the\nprovision of care difficult or impossible to achieve. The\novercrowding is the “primary cause of the violation of a\nFederal right,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically\nthe severe and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners\n4                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough grossly inadequate provision of medical and\nmental health care.\n   This Court now holds that the PLRA does authorize the\nrelief afforded in this case and that the court-mandated\npopulation limit is necessary to remedy the violation of\nprisoners’ constitutional rights. The order of the three\njudge court, subject to the right of the State to seek\nits modification in appropriate circumstances, must be\naffirmed.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The degree of overcrowding in California’s prisons is\nexceptional. California’s prisons are designed to house a\npopulation just under 80,000, but at the time of the three\njudge court’s decision the population was almost double\nthat. The State’s prisons had operated at around 200% of\ndesign capacity for at least 11 years. Prisoners are\ncrammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to\nhouse inmates. As many as 200 prisoners may live in a\ngymnasium, monitored by as few as two or three correc\ntional officers. App. 1337–1338, 1350; see Appendix B,\ninfra. As many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.\nApp. 1337.\n   The Corrections Independent Review Panel, a body\nappointed by the Governor and composed of correctional\nconsultants and representatives from state agencies,\nconcluded that California’s prisons are “ ‘severely over\ncrowded, imperiling the safety of both correctional em\nployees and inmates.’ ”1 Juris. Statement App., O. T. 2009,\n——————\n   1 A similar conclusion was reached by the Little Hoover Commission,\n\na bipartisan and independent state body, which stated that\n“[o]vercrowded conditions inside the prison walls are unsafe for inmates\nand staff,” Solving California’s Corrections Crisis: Time is Running Out\n17 (Jan. 2007), and that “California’s correctional system is in a tail\nspin,” id., at i.\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

In 2006,\nthen-Governor Schwarzenegger declared a state of emer\ngency in the prisons, as “ ‘immediate action is necessary to\nprevent death and harm caused by California’s severe\nprison overcrowding.’ ” Id., at 61a. The consequences of\novercrowding identified by the Governor include “ ‘in\ncreased, substantial risk for transmission of infectious\nillness’ ” and a suicide rate “ ‘approaching an average of\none per week.’ ” Ibid.\n   Prisoners in California with serious mental illness do\nnot receive minimal, adequate care. Because of a shortage\nof treatment beds, suicidal inmates may be held for pro\nlonged periods in telephone-booth sized cages without\ntoilets. See Appendix C, infra. A psychiatric expert re\nported observing an inmate who had been held in such a\ncage for nearly 24 hours, standing in a pool of his own\nurine, unresponsive and nearly catatonic. Prison officials\nexplained they had “ ‘no place to put him.’ ” App. 593.\n——————\n   At trial, current and former California prison officials also testified to\nthe degree of overcrowding. Jeanne Woodford, who recently adminis\ntered California’s prison system, stated that “ ‘[o]vercrowding in the\n[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)] is\nextreme, its effects are pervasive and it is preventing the Department\nfrom providing adequate mental and medical health care to prisoners.’ ”\nJuris. App. 84a. Matthew Cate, the head of the California prison\nsystem, stated that “ ‘overpopulation makes everything we do more\ndifficult.’ ” Ibid. And Robin Dezember, chief deputy secretary of Cor\nrectional Healthcare Services, stated that “we are terribly overcrowded\nin our prison system” and “overcrowding has negative effects on every\nbody in the prison system.” Tr. 853, 856.\n   Experts from outside California offered similar assessments. Doyle\nWayne Scott, the former head of corrections in Texas, described con\nditions in California’s prisons as “appalling,” “inhumane,” and “unac\nceptable” and stated that “[i]n more than 35 years of prison work\nexperience, I have never seen anything like it.” App. 1337. Joseph\nLehman, the former head of correctional systems in Washington,\nMaine, and Pennsylvania, concluded that “[t]here is no question that\nCalifornia’s prisons are overcrowded” and that “this is an emergency\nsituation; it calls for drastic and immediate action.” Id., at 1312.\n6                          BROWN v.

Wait times for mental health care range as high\nas 12 months. Id., at 704. In 2006, the suicide rate\nin California’s prisons was nearly 80% higher than the\nnational average for prison populations; and a court\nappointed Special Master found that 72.1% of suicides\ninvolved “some measure of inadequate assessment, treat\nment, or intervention, and were therefore most probably\nforeseeable and/or preventable.”2 Id., at 1781.\n  Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive\nseverely deficient care. California’s prisons were designed\nto meet the medical needs of a population at 100% of\ndesign capacity and so have only half the clinical space\nneeded to treat the current population.

The Special Master later\nissued an analysis for the year 2007. This report concluded that the\n2007 suicide rate was “a continuation of the CDCR’s pattern of exceed\ning the national prison suicide rate.” Record in No. 2:90–CV–00520–\nLKK–JFM (ED/ND Cal.), Doc. 3677, p. 1. The report found that the\nrate of suicides involving inadequate assessment, treatment, or inter\nvention had risen to 82% and concluded that “[t]hese numbers clearly\nindicate no improvement in this area during the past several years, and\npossibly signal a trend of ongoing deterioration.” Id., at 12. No de\ntailed study has been filed since then, but in September 2010 the\nSpecial Master filed a report stating that “the data for 2010 so far is not\nshowing improvement in suicide prevention.” App. 868.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Plaintiffs rely on systemwide deficiencies in the\nprovision of medical and mental health care that, taken as a whole,\nsubject sick and mentally ill prisoners in California to “substantial risk\nof serious harm” and cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall\nbelow the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.

S. 825, 834 (1994).\n   4 In 2007, the last year for which the three-judge court had available\n\nstatistics, an analysis of deaths in California’s prisons found 68 pre\nventable or possibly preventable deaths. California Prison Health Care\nReceivership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis of Year 2007 Death Reviews 18\n(Nov. 2008). This was essentially unchanged from 2006, when an\nanalysis found 66 preventable or possibly preventable deaths. Ibid.\nThese statistics mean that, during 2006 and 2007, a preventable or\npossibly preventable death occurred once every five to six days.\n   Both preventable and possibly preventable deaths involve major\nlapses in medical care and are a serious cause for concern. In one\ntypical case classified as a possibly preventable death, an analysis\nrevealed the following lapses: “16 month delay in evaluating abnormal\nliver mass; 8 month delay in receiving regular chemotherapy . . . ;\nmultiple providers fail to respond to jaundice and abnormal liver\nfunction tests causing 17 month delay in diagnosis.” California Prison\nHealth Care Receivership Corp., K.

Brown, was filed in\n1990. Coleman involves the class of seriously mentally ill\npersons in California prisons. Over 15 years ago, in 1995,\nafter a 39-day trial, the Coleman District Court found\n“overwhelming evidence of the systematic failure to de\nliver necessary care to mentally ill inmates” in California\nprisons. Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1316 (ED\nCal.). The prisons were “seriously and chronically under\nstaffed,” id., at 1306, and had “no effective method for\nensuring . . . the competence of their staff,” id., at 1308.\nThe prisons had failed to implement necessary suicide\nprevention procedures, “due in large measure to the severe\nunderstaffing.” Id., at 1315. Mentally ill inmates “lan\nguished for months, or even years, without access to nec\nessary care.” Id., at 1316. “They suffer from severe hallu\ncinations, [and] they decompensate into catatonic states.”\nIbid. The court appointed a Special Master to oversee\ndevelopment and implementation of a remedial plan of\naction.\n   In 2007, 12 years after his appointment, the Special\n——————\n(hereinafter 2009 Death Reviews).\n  The three-judge court did not have access to statistics for 2008, but in\nthat year the number of preventable or possibly preventable deaths\nheld steady at 66. California Prison Health Care Receivership Corp.,\nK. Imai, Analysis of Year 2008 Death Reviews 9 (Dec. 2009). In 2009,\nthe number of preventable or possibly preventable deaths dropped to\n46. 2009 Death Reviews 11, 13. The three-judge court could not have\nanticipated this development, and it would be inappropriate for this\nCourt to evaluate its significance for the first time on appeal. The\nthree-judge court should, of course, consider this and any other evi\ndence of improved conditions when considering future requests by the\nState for modification of its order. See infra, at 45–48.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMaster in Coleman filed a report stating that, after years\nof slow improvement, the state of mental health care\nin California’s prisons was deteriorating. App. 489. The\nSpecial Master ascribed this change to increased over\ncrowding. The rise in population had led to greater\ndemand for care, and existing programming space and\nstaffing levels were inadequate to keep pace. Prisons had\nretained more mental health staff, but the “growth of the\nresource [had] not matched the rise in demand.” Id., at\n482. At the very time the need for space was rising, the\nneed to house the expanding population had also caused a\n“reduction of programming space now occupied by inmate\nbunks.” Id., at 479. The State was “facing a four to five\nyear gap in the availability of sufficient beds to meet the\ntreatment needs of many inmates/patients.” Id., at 481.\n“[I]ncreasing numbers of truly psychotic inmate/patients\nare trapped in [lower levels of treatment] that cannot meet\ntheir needs.” Ibid. The Special Master concluded that\nmany early “achievements have succumbed to the inexo\nrably rising tide of population, leaving behind growing\nfrustration and despair.” Id., at 489.\n                             C\n   The second action, Plata v. Brown, involves the class of\nstate prisoners with serious medical conditions. After this\naction commenced in 2001, the State conceded that defi\nciencies in prison medical care violated prisoners’ Eighth\nAmendment rights. The State stipulated to a remedial\ninjunction. The State failed to comply with that injunc\ntion, and in 2005 the court appointed a Receiver to oversee\nremedial efforts. The court found that “the California\nprison medical care system is broken beyond repair,”\nresulting in an “unconscionable degree of suffering and\ndeath.” App. 917. The court found: “[I]t is an uncontested\nfact that, on average, an inmate in one of California’s\nprisons needlessly dies every six to seven days due to\n10                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional deficiencies in the [California prisons’]\nmedical delivery system.” Ibid. And the court made\nfindings regarding specific instances of neglect, including\nthe following:\n     “[A] San Quentin prisoner with hypertension, diabetes\n     and renal failure was prescribed two different medica\n     tions that actually served to exacerbate his renal fail\n     ure. An optometrist noted the patient’s retinal bleed\n     ing due to very high blood pressure and referred him\n     for immediate evaluation, but this evaluation never\n     took place. It was not until a year later that the pa\n     tient’s renal failure was recognized, at which point he\n     was referred to a nephrologist on an urgent basis;\n     he should have been seen by the specialist within 14\n     days but the consultation never happened and the pa\n     tient died three months later.” Id., at 928 (citations\n     omitted).\nPrisons were unable to retain sufficient numbers of com\npetent medical staff, id., at 937, and would “hire any\ndoctor who had ‘a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,’ ” id.,\nat 926. Medical facilities lacked “necessary medical equip\nment” and did “not meet basic sanitation standards.” Id.,\nat 944. “Exam tables and counter tops, where prisoners\nwith . . . communicable diseases are treated, [were] not\nroutinely disinfected.” Ibid.\n  In 2008, three years after the District Court’s decision,\nthe Receiver described continuing deficiencies in the\nhealth care provided by California prisons:\n     “Timely access is not assured. The number of medical\n     personnel has been inadequate, and competence has\n     not been assured. . . . Adequate housing for the dis\n     abled and aged does not exist. The medical facilities,\n     when they exist at all, are in an abysmal state of dis\n     repair. Basic medical equipment is often not available\n     or used.

Indeed, it is\n    a misnomer to call the existing chaos a ‘medical deliv\n    ery system’—it is more an act of desperation than a\n    system.” Record in No. 3:01–CV–01351–TEH (ND\n    Cal.), Doc. 1136, p. 5.\nA report by the Receiver detailed the impact of overcrowd\ning on efforts to remedy the violation. The Receiver ex\nplained that “overcrowding, combined with staffing short\nages, has created a culture of cynicism, fear, and despair\nwhich makes hiring and retaining competent clinicians\nextremely difficult.” App. 1031. “[O]vercrowding, and the\nresulting day to day operational chaos of the [prison sys\ntem], creates regular ‘crisis’ situations which . . . take time\n[and] energy . . . away from important remedial pro\ngrams.” Id., at 1035. Overcrowding had increased the\nincidence of infectious disease, id., at 1037–1038, and had\nled to rising prison violence and greater reliance by custo\ndial staff on lockdowns, which “inhibit the delivery of\nmedical care and increase the staffing necessary for such\ncare.” Id., at 1037. “Every day,” the Receiver reported,\n“California prison wardens and health care managers\nmake the difficult decision as to which of the class actions,\nColeman . . . or Plata they will fail to comply with because\nof staff shortages and patient loads.” Id., at 1038.\n                             D\n   The Coleman and Plata plaintiffs, believing that a rem\nedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care\ncould not be achieved without reducing overcrowding,\nmoved their respective District Courts to convene a three\njudge court empowered under the PLRA to order reduc\ntions in the prison population. The judges in both actions\ngranted the request, and the cases were consolidated\nbefore a single three-judge court. The State has not chal\nlenged the validity of the consolidation in proceedings\nbefore this Court, so its propriety is not presented by this\n12                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappeal.\n   The three-judge court heard 14 days of testimony and\nissued a 184-page opinion, making extensive findings of\nfact. The court ordered California to reduce its prison\npopulation to 137.5% of the prisons’ design capacity within\ntwo years. Assuming the State does not increase capacity\nthrough new construction, the order requires a population\nreduction of 38,000 to 46,000 persons. Because it appears\nall but certain that the State cannot complete sufficient\nconstruction to comply fully with the order, the prison\npopulation will have to be reduced to at least some extent.\nThe court did not order the State to achieve this reduction\nin any particular manner. Instead, the court ordered the\nState to formulate a plan for compliance and submit its\nplan for approval by the court.\n   The State appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n§1253, and the Court postponed consideration of the ques\ntion of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. Schwar\nzenegger v. Plata, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners may be\ndeprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet the\nlaw and the Constitution demand recognition of certain\nother rights. Prisoners retain the essence of human dig\nnity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity\nanimates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishment. “ ‘The basic concept underlying\nthe Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of\nman.’ ” Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002) (quot\ning Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality\nopinion)).\n  To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means\nto provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent\non the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care.\nA prison’s failure to provide sustenance for inmates “may\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactually produce physical ‘torture or a lingering death.’ ”\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re\nKemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A.\nElsner, Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\n(2004). Just as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or she\nmay suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care. A\nprison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, includ\ning adequate medical care, is incompatible with the con\ncept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.\n   If government fails to fulfill this obligation, the courts\nhave a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth\nAmendment violation. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,\n687, n. 9 (1978). Courts must be sensitive to the State’s\ninterest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as\nwell as the need for deference to experienced and expert\nprison administrators faced with the difficult and danger\nous task of housing large numbers of convicted criminals.\nSee Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547–548 (1979). Courts\nnevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to “en\nforce the constitutional rights of all ‘persons,’ including\nprisoners.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 321 (1972) (per\ncuriam). Courts may not allow constitutional violations to\ncontinue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion\ninto the realm of prison administration.\n   Courts faced with the sensitive task of remedying un\nconstitutional prison conditions must consider a range of\navailable options, including appointment of special mas\nters or receivers and the possibility of consent decrees.\nWhen necessary to ensure compliance with a constitu\ntional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on\na prison’s population. By its terms, the PLRA restricts the\ncircumstances in which a court may enter an order “that\nhas the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison\npopulation.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(g)(4). The order in this\ncase does not necessarily require the State to release any\nprisoners. The State may comply by raising the design\n14                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncapacity of its prisons or by transferring prisoners to\ncounty facilities or facilities in other States. Because the\norder limits the prison population as a percentage of de\nsign capacity, it nonetheless has the “effect of reducing or\nlimiting the prison population.” Ibid.\n   Under the PLRA, only a three-judge court may enter an\norder limiting a prison population. §3626(a)(3)(B). Before\na three-judge court may be convened, a district court first\nmust have entered an order for less intrusive relief that\nfailed to remedy the constitutional violation and must\nhave given the defendant a reasonable time to comply\nwith its prior orders. §3626(a)(3)(A). The party request\ning a three-judge court must then submit “materials suffi\ncient to demonstrate that [these requirements] have been\nmet.” §3626(a)(3)(C). If the district court concludes that\nthe materials are, in fact, sufficient, a three-judge court\nmay be convened. Ibid.; see also 28 U. S. C. §2284(b)(1)\n(stating that a three-judge court may not be convened if\nthe district court “determines that three judges are not\nrequired”); 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & V.\nAmar, Federal Practice and Procedure §4235 (3d ed. 2007).\n   The three-judge court must then find by clear and con\nvincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of\nthe violation of a Federal right” and that “no other relief\nwill remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(E). As with any award of prospective relief\nunder the PLRA, the relief “shall extend no further than\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of\na particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” §3626(a)(1)(A). The\nthree-judge court must therefore find that the relief is\n“narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary . . . ,\nand is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right.” Ibid. In making this de\ntermination, the three-judge court must give “substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the op\neration of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.”\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. Applying these standards, the three-judge court\nfound a population limit appropriate, necessary, and\nauthorized in this case.\n   This Court’s review of the three-judge court’s legal\ndeterminations is de novo, but factual findings are re\nviewed for clear error. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470\nU. S. 564, 573–574 (1985). Deference to trial court fact\nfinding reflects an understanding that “[t]he trial judge’s\nmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experi\nence in fulfilling that role comes expertise.” Id., at 574.\nThe three-judge court oversaw two weeks of trial and\nheard at considerable length from California prison offi\ncials, as well as experts in the field of correctional admini\nstration. The judges had the opportunity to ask relevant\nquestions of those witnesses. Two of the judges had over\nseen the ongoing remedial efforts of the Receiver and\nSpecial Master. The three-judge court was well situated\nto make the difficult factual judgments necessary to fash\nion a remedy for this complex and intractable constitu\ntional violation. The three-judge court’s findings of fact\nmay be reversed only if this Court is left with a “ ‘definite\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’ ”\nId., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum\nCo., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)).\n                             A\n  The State contends that it was error to convene the\nthree-judge court without affording it more time to comply\nwith the prior orders in Coleman and Plata.\n                              1\n   The parties dispute this Court’s jurisdiction to review\nthe determinations of the Coleman and Plata District\nCourts that a three-judge court should be convened.\nPlaintiffs claim the State was required to raise this issue\nfirst in the Court of Appeals by appealing the orders of the\n16                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Courts. When exercising jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. §1253, however, this Court “has not hesitated to\nexercise jurisdiction ‘to determine the authority of the\ncourt below,’ ” including whether the three-judge court was\nproperly constituted. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees\nCredit Union, 419 U. S. 90, 95, n. 12 (1974) (quoting Bailey\nv. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 34 (1962) (per curiam)); see also\nGully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., 292 U. S. 16, 18 (1934)\n(per curiam) (“The case is analogous to those in which this\nCourt, finding that the court below has acted without\njurisdiction, exercises its appellate jurisdiction to correct\nthe improper action”). The merits of the decision to con\nvene the three-judge court, therefore, are properly before\nthis Court.\n                               2\n   Before a three-judge court may be convened to consider\nwhether to enter a population limit, the PLRA requires\nthat the court have “previously entered an order for less\nintrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation\nof the Federal right sought to be remedied.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(i). This provision refers to “an order.” It\nis satisfied if the court has entered one order, and this sin\ngle order has “failed to remedy” the constitutional viola\ntion. The defendant must also have had “a reasonable\namount of time to comply with the previous court orders.”\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(ii). This provision refers to the court’s\n“orders.” It requires that the defendant have been given a\nreasonable time to comply with all of the court’s orders.\nTogether, these requirements ensure that the “ ‘last resort\nremedy’ ” of a population limit is not imposed “ ‘as a first\nstep.’ ” Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F. 2d 828, 843\n(CADC 1988).\n   The first of these conditions, the previous order re\nquirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(i), was satisfied in Coleman\nby appointment of a Special Master in 1995, and it was\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)         17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfied in Plata by approval of a consent decree and\nstipulated injunction in 2002. Both orders were intended\nto remedy the constitutional violations. Both were given\nample time to succeed. When the three-judge court was\nconvened, 12 years had passed since the appointment of\nthe Coleman Special Master, and 5 years had passed since\nthe approval of the Plata consent decree. The State does\nnot claim that either order achieved a remedy. Although\nthe PLRA entitles a State to terminate remedial orders\nsuch as these after two years unless the district court\nfinds that the relief “remains necessary to correct a\ncurrent and ongoing violation of the Federal right,”\n§3626(b)(3), California has not attempted to obtain relief\non this basis.\n   The State claims instead that the second condition, the\nreasonable time requirement of §3626(a)(3)(A)(ii), was not\nmet because other, later remedial efforts should have been\ngiven more time to succeed. In 2006, the Coleman District\nJudge approved a revised plan of action calling for con\nstruction of new facilities, hiring of new staff, and im\nplementation of new procedures. That same year, the\nPlata District Judge selected and appointed a Receiver to\noversee the State’s ongoing remedial efforts. When the\nthree-judge court was convened, the Receiver had filed a\npreliminary plan of action calling for new construction,\nhiring of additional staff, and other procedural reforms.\n   Although both the revised plan of action in Coleman and\nthe appointment of the Receiver in Plata were new devel\nopments in the courts’ remedial efforts, the basic plan to\nsolve the crisis through construction, hiring, and proce\ndural reforms remained unchanged. These efforts had\nbeen ongoing for years; the failed consent decree in Plata\nhad called for implementation of new procedures and\nhiring of additional staff; and the Coleman Special Master\nhad issued over 70 orders directed at achieving a remedy\nthrough construction, hiring, and procedural reforms.

PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nColeman Special Master and Plata Receiver were unable\nto provide assurance that further, substantially similar\nefforts would yield success absent a population reduction.\nInstead, the Coleman Special Master explained that\n“many of the clinical advances . . . painfully accomplished\nover the past decade are slip-sliding away” as a result of\novercrowding. App. 481–482. And the Plata Receiver\nindicated that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, a\nsuccessful remedial effort could “all but bankrupt” the\nState of California. App. 1053.\n  Having engaged in remedial efforts for 5 years in Plata\nand 12 in Coleman, the District Courts were not required\nto wait to see whether their more recent efforts would\nyield equal disappointment. When a court attempts to\nremedy an entrenched constitutional violation through\nreform of a complex institution, such as this statewide\nprison system, it may be necessary in the ordinary course\nto issue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing\nremedial efforts. Each new order must be given a reason\nable time to succeed, but reasonableness must be assessed\nin light of the entire history of the court’s remedial efforts.\nA contrary reading of the reasonable time requirement\nwould in effect require district courts to impose a morato\nrium on new remedial orders before issuing a population\nlimit. This unnecessary period of inaction would delay an\neventual remedy and would prolong the courts’ involve\nment, serving neither the State nor the prisoners. Con\ngress did not require this unreasonable result when it\nused the term “reasonable.”\n  The Coleman and Plata courts had a solid basis to doubt\nthat additional efforts to build new facilities and hire new\nstaff would achieve a remedy. Indeed, although 5 years\nhave now passed since the appointment of the Plata\nReceiver and approval of the revised plan of action in\nColeman, there is no indication that the constitutional\nviolations have been cured. A report filed by the Coleman\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSpecial Master in July 2009 describes ongoing violations,\nincluding an “absence of timely access to appropriate\nlevels of care at every point in the system.” App. 807. A\nreport filed by the Plata Receiver in October 2010 likewise\ndescribes ongoing deficiencies in the provision of medical\ncare and concludes that there are simply “too many pris\noners for the healthcare infrastructure.” Id., at 1655. The\nColeman and Plata courts acted reasonably when they\nconvened a three-judge court without further delay.\n                             B\n   Once a three-judge court has been convened, the court\nmust find additional requirements satisfied before it may\nimpose a population limit. The first of these requirements\nis that “crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a\nFederal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i).\n                              1\n   The three-judge court found the primary cause require\nment satisfied by the evidence at trial. The court found\nthat overcrowding strains inadequate medical and mental\nhealth facilities; overburdens limited clinical and custodial\nstaff; and creates violent, unsanitary, and chaotic condi\ntions that contribute to the constitutional violations and\nfrustrate efforts to fashion a remedy. The three-judge\ncourt also found that “until the problem of overcrowding is\novercome it will be impossible to provide constitutionally\ncompliant care to California’s prison population.” Juris.\nApp. 141a.\n   The parties dispute the standard of review applicable to\nthis determination. With respect to the three-judge court’s\nfactual findings, this Court’s review is necessarily deferen\ntial. It is not this Court’s place to “duplicate the role” of\nthe trial court. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 573. The ultimate\nissue of primary cause presents a mixed question of law\nand fact; but there, too, “the mix weighs heavily on the\n20                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n‘fact’ side.” Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 148 (1999)\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Because the\n“district court is ‘better positioned’ . . . to decide the issue,”\nour review of the three-judge court’s primary cause deter\nmination is deferential. Salve Regina College v. Russell,\n499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991).\n   The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning\ndemand on the provision of care. At the time of trial,\nvacancy rates for medical and mental health staff ranged\nas high as 20% for surgeons, 25% for physicians, 39% for\nnurse practitioners, and 54.1% for psychiatrists. Juris.\nApp. 105a, 108a. These percentages are based on the\nnumber of positions budgeted by the State. Dr. Ronald\nShansky, former medical director of the Illinois prison\nsystem, concluded that these numbers understate the se\nverity of the crisis because the State has not budgeted\nsufficient staff to meet demand.5              According to Dr.\nShansky, “even if the prisons were able to fill all of their\nvacant health care positions, which they have not been\nable to do to date, . . . the prisons would still be unable to\nhandle the level of need given the current overcrowding.”\nRecord in No. 2:90–CV–00520–LKK–JFM (ED Cal.), Doc.\n3231–13, p. 16 (hereinafter Doc. 3231–13). Dr. Craig\nHaney, a professor of psychology, reported that mental\nhealth staff are “managing far larger caseloads than is\nappropriate or effective.” App. 596. A prison psychiatrist\ntold Dr. Haney that “ ‘we are doing about 50% of what we\nshould be doing.’ ” Ibid. In the context of physical care Dr.\nShansky agreed that “demand for care, particularly for the\nhigh priority cases, continues to overwhelm the resources\n——————\n  5 Dr. Craig Haney likewise testified that the State had “significantly\n\nunderestimated the staffing needed to implement critical portions of the\nColeman Program Guide requirements,” that “key tasks were omitted\nwhen determining staffing workloads,” and that estimates were based\non “key assumptions” that caused the State to underestimate demand\nfor mental health care. App. 596–597.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\navailable.” Id., at 1408.\n    Even on the assumption that vacant positions could be\nfilled, the evidence suggested there would be insufficient\nspace for the necessary additional staff to perform their\njobs. The Plata Receiver, in his report on overcrowding,\nconcluded that even the “newest and most modern pris\nons” had been “designed with clinic space which is only\none-half that necessary for the real-life capacity of the\nprisons.” App. 1023 (emphasis deleted). Dr. Haney re\nported that “[e]ach one of the facilities I toured was short\nof significant amounts of space needed to perform other\nwise critical tasks and responsibilities.” Id., at 597–598.\nIn one facility, staff cared for 7,525 prisoners in space\ndesigned for one-third as many. Juris. App. 93a. Staff\noperate out of converted storage rooms, closets, bath\nrooms, shower rooms, and visiting centers. These make\nshift facilities impede the effective delivery of care and\nplace the safety of medical professionals in jeopardy,\ncompounding the difficulty of hiring additional staff.\n    This shortfall of resources relative to demand contrib\nutes to significant delays in treatment. Mentally ill pris\noners are housed in administrative segregation while\nawaiting transfer to scarce mental health treatment beds\nfor appropriate care. One correctional officer indicated\nthat he had kept mentally ill prisoners in segregation for\n“ ‘6 months or more.’ ” App. 594. Other prisoners awaiting\ncare are held in tiny, phone-booth sized cages. The record\ndocuments instances of prisoners committing suicide while\nawaiting treatment.6\n    Delays are no less severe in the context of physical care.\n——————\n  6 For instance, Dr. Pablo Stewart reported that one prisoner was\n\nreferred to a crisis bed but, “[a]fter learning that the restraint room\nwas not available and that there were no crisis beds open, staff moved\n[the prisoner] back to his administrative segregation cell without any\nprescribed observation.” App. 736. The prisoner “hanged himself that\nnight in his cell.” Ibid.; see also Juris. App. 99a.\n22                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPrisons have backlogs of up to 700 prisoners waiting to see\na doctor. Doc. 3231–13, at 18. A review of referrals for\nurgent specialty care at one prison revealed that only 105\nof 316 pending referrals had a scheduled appointment,\nand only 2 had an appointment scheduled to occur within\n14 days. Id., at 22–23. Urgent specialty referrals at one\nprison had been pending for six months to a year. Id.,\nat 27.\n  Crowding also creates unsafe and unsanitary living\nconditions that hamper effective delivery of medical and\nmental health care. A medical expert described living\nquarters in converted gymnasiums or dayrooms, where\nlarge numbers of prisoners may share just a few toilets\nand showers, as “ ‘breeding grounds for disease.’ ”7 Juris.\nApp. 102a. Cramped conditions promote unrest and vio\nlence, making it difficult for prison officials to monitor and\ncontrol the prison population. On any given day, prisoners\nin the general prison population may become ill, thus\nentering the plaintiff class; and overcrowding may prevent\nimmediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering,\ndeath, or spread of disease. After one prisoner was as\nsaulted in a crowded gymnasium, prison staff did not even\nlearn of the injury until the prisoner had been dead for\nseveral hours. Tr. 382. Living in crowded, unsafe, and\nunsanitary conditions can cause prisoners with latent\nmental illnesses to worsen and develop overt symptoms.\nCrowding may also impede efforts to improve delivery of\n\n——————\n  7 Correctional officials at trial described several outbreaks of disease.\n\nOne officer testified that antibiotic-resistant staph infections spread\nwidely among the prison population and described prisoners “bleeding,\noozing with pus that is soaking through their clothes when they come\nin to get the wound covered and treated.” Tr. 601, 604–605. Another\nwitness testified that inmates with influenza were sent back from the\ninfirmary due to a lack of beds and that the disease quickly spread to\n“more than half ” the 340 prisoners in the housing unit, with the result\nthat the unit was placed on lockdown for a week. Id., at 720–721.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncare. Two prisoners committed suicide by hanging after\nbeing placed in cells that had been identified as requiring\na simple fix to remove attachment points that could sup\nport a noose. The repair was not made because doing so\nwould involve removing prisoners from the cells, and there\nwas no place to put them. Id., at 769–777. More gen\nerally, Jeanne Woodford, the former acting secretary of\nCalifornia’s prisons, testified that there “ ‘are simply too\nmany issues that arise from such a large number of pris\noners,’ ” and that, as a result, “ ‘management spends virtu\nally all of its time fighting fires instead of engaging in\nthoughtful decision-making and planning’ ” of the sort\nneeded to fashion an effective remedy for these constitu\ntional violations. Juris. App. 82a.\n    Increased violence also requires increased reliance on\nlockdowns to keep order, and lockdowns further impede\nthe effective delivery of care. In 2006, prison officials\ninstituted 449 lockdowns. Id., at 116a. The average lock\ndown lasted 12 days, and 20 lockdowns lasted 60 days or\nlonger. Ibid. During lockdowns, staff must either escort\nprisoners to medical facilities or bring medical staff to the\nprisoners. Either procedure puts additional strain on\nalready overburdened medical and custodial staff. Some\nprogramming for the mentally ill even may be canceled\naltogether during lockdowns, and staff may be unable to\nsupervise the delivery of psychotropic medications.\n    The effects of overcrowding are particularly acute in\nthe prisons’ reception centers, intake areas that process\n140,000 new or returning prisoners every year. Id., at\n85a. Crowding in these areas runs as high as 300% of\ndesign capacity. Id., at 86a. Living conditions are\n“ ‘toxic,’ ” and a lack of treatment space impedes efforts to\nidentify inmate medical or mental health needs and pro\nvide even rudimentary care. Id., at 92a. The former\nwarden of San Quentin reported that doctors in that\nprison’s reception center “ ‘were unable to keep up with\n24                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nphysicals or provid[e] any kind of chronic care follow-up.’ ”\nId., at 90a. Inmates spend long periods of time in these\nareas awaiting transfer to the general population. Some\nprisoners are held in the reception centers for their entire\nperiod of incarceration.\n    Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary\ncause of the constitutional violations. The former warden\nof San Quentin and former acting secretary of the Califor\nnia prisons concluded that crowding “makes it ‘virtually\nimpossible for the organization to develop, much less\nimplement, a plan to provide prisoners with adequate\ncare.’ ” Id., at 83a. The former executive director of the\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice testified that\n“ ‘[e]verything revolves around overcrowding” and that\n“ ‘overcrowding is the primary cause of the medical and\nmental health care violations.’ ” Id., at 127a. The former\nhead of corrections in Pennsylvania, Washington, and\nMaine testified that overcrowding is “ ‘overwhelming the\nsystem both in terms of sheer numbers, in terms of the\nspace available, in terms of providing healthcare.’ ” Ibid.\nAnd the current secretary of the Pennsylvania Depart\nment of Corrections testified that “ ‘‘the biggest inhibiting\nfactor right now in California being able to deliver appro\npriate mental health and medical care is the severe over\ncrowding.’ ” Id., at 82a.\n                             2\n   The State attempts to undermine the substantial evi\ndence presented at trial, and the three-judge court’s find\nings of fact, by complaining that the three-judge court did\nnot allow it to present evidence of current prison condi\ntions. This suggestion lacks a factual basis.\n   The three-judge court properly admitted evidence of\ncurrent conditions as relevant to the issues before it. The\nthree-judge court allowed discovery until a few months\nbefore trial; expert witnesses based their conclusions on\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             25\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrecent observations of prison conditions; the court ad\nmitted recent reports on prison conditions by the Plata\nReceiver and Coleman Special Master; and both parties\npresented testimony related to current conditions, includ\ning understaffing, inadequate facilities, and unsanitary\nand unsafe living conditions. See supra, at 4–8, 19–24.\nDr. Craig Haney, for example, based his expert report on\ntours of eight California prisons. App. 539. These tours\noccurred as late as August 2008, two weeks before Dr.\nHaney submitted his report and less than four months\nbefore the first day of trial. Id., at 585; see also id., at 563,\n565, 580 (July tours). Other experts submitted reports\nbased on similar observations. See, e.g., Doc. 3231–13,\nat 6 (Dr. Shansky); App. 646 (Dr. Stewart); id., at 1245\n(Austin); id., at 1312 (Lehman).\n   The three-judge court’s opinion cited and relied on this\nevidence of current conditions. The court relied exten\nsively on the expert witness reports. See generally Juris.\nApp. 85a–143a. The court cited the most current data\navailable on suicides and preventable deaths in the Cali\nfornia prisons. Id., at 123a, 125a. The court relied on\nstatistics on staff vacancies that dated to three months\nbefore trial, id., at 105a, 108a, and statistics on shortages\nof treatment beds for the same period, id., at 97a. These\nare just examples of the extensive evidence of current\nconditions that informed every aspect of the judgment of\nthe three-judge court. The three-judge court did not abuse\nits discretion when it also cited findings made in earlier\ndecisions of the Plata and Coleman District Courts. Those\nfindings remained relevant to establish the nature of these\nlongstanding, continuing constitutional violations.\n   It is true that the three-judge court established a cutoff\ndate for discovery a few months before trial. The order\nstated that site inspections of prisons would be allowed\nuntil that date, and that evidence of “changed prison\nconditions” after that date would not be admitted. App.\n26                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1190. The court also excluded evidence not pertinent to\nthe issue whether a population limit is appropriate under\nthe PLRA, including evidence relevant solely to the exis\ntence of an ongoing constitutional violation. The court\nreasoned that its decision was limited to the issue of rem\nedy and that the merits of the constitutional violation had\nalready been determined. The three-judge court made\nclear that all such evidence would be considered “[t]o the\nextent that it illuminates questions that are properly\nbefore the court.” App. 2339.\n   Both rulings were within the sound discretion of the\nthree-judge court. Orderly trial management may require\ndiscovery deadlines and a clean distinction between litiga\ntion of the merits and the remedy. The State in fact\nrepresented to the three-judge court that it would be “ap\npropriate” to cut off discovery before trial because “like\nplaintiffs, we, too, are really gearing up and going into a\npretrial mode.” Id., at 1683. And if the State truly be\nlieved there was no longer a violation, it could have argued\nto the Coleman and Plata District Courts that a three\njudge court should not be convened because the District\nCourts’ prior orders had not “failed to remedy the dep\nrivation” of prisoners’ constitutional rights. 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(3)(A)(i); see also supra, at 16–17. Once the three\njudge court was convened, that court was not required to\nreconsider the merits. Its role was solely to consider the\npropriety and necessity of a population limit.\n   The State does not point to any significant evidence that\nit was unable to present and that would have changed the\noutcome of the proceedings. To the contrary, the record\nand opinion make clear that the decision of the three\njudge court was based on current evidence pertaining to\nongoing constitutional violations.\n                              3\n     The three-judge court acknowledged that the violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  27\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwere caused by factors in addition to overcrowding and\nthat reducing crowding in the prisons would not entirely\ncure the violations. This is consistent with the reports\nof the Coleman Special Master and Plata Receiver, both\nof whom concluded that even a significant reduction in the\nprison population would not remedy the violations absent\ncontinued efforts to train staff, improve facilities, and\nreform procedures. App. 487, 1054.8 The three-judge\ncourt nevertheless found that overcrowding was the pri\nmary cause in the sense of being the foremost cause of the\nviolation.\n   This understanding of the primary cause requirement is\nconsistent with the text of the PLRA. The State in fact\nconcedes that it proposed this very definition of primary\ncause to the three-judge court. “Primary” is defined as\n“[f]irst or highest in rank, quality, or importance; princi\npal.” American Heritage Dictionary 1393 (4th ed. 2000);\nsee also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1800 (2002) (defining “primary” as “first in rank or impor\ntance”); 12 Oxford English Dictionary 472 (2d ed. 1989)\n(defining “primary” as “[o]f the first or highest rank or\nimportance; that claims the first consideration; principal,\nchief ”). Overcrowding need only be the foremost, chief, or\nprincipal cause of the violation. If Congress had intended\n——————\n  8 The Plata Receiver concluded that those who believed a population\n\nreduction would be a panacea were “simply wrong.” App. 1054–1055.\nThe Receiver nevertheless made clear that “the time this process will\ntake, and the cost and the scope of intrusion by the Federal Court\ncannot help but increase, and increase in a very significant manner, if\nthe scope and characteristics of [California prison] overcrowding\ncontinue.” Id., at 1053. The Coleman Special Master likewise found\nthat a large release of prisoners, without other relief, would leave the\nviolation “largely unmitigated” even though deficiencies in care “are\nunquestionably exacerbated by overcrowding” and “defendants’ ability\nto provide required mental health services would be enhanced consid\nerably by a reduction in the overall census” of the prisons. App. 486–\n487.\n28                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto require that crowding be the only cause, it would have\nsaid so, assuming in its judgment that definition would be\nconsistent with constitutional limitations.\n   As this case illustrates, constitutional violations in\nconditions of confinement are rarely susceptible of simple\nor straightforward solutions. In addition to overcrowding\nthe failure of California’s prisons to provide adequate\nmedical and mental health care may be ascribed to chronic\nand worsening budget shortfalls, a lack of political will in\nfavor of reform, inadequate facilities, and systemic admin\nistrative failures. The Plata District Judge, in his order\nappointing the Receiver, compared the problem to “ ‘a\nspider web, in which the tension of the various strands is\ndetermined by the relationship among all the parts of the\nweb, so that if one pulls on a single strand, the tension of\nthe entire web is redistributed in a new and complex\npattern.’ ” App. 966–967 (quoting Fletcher, The Discre\ntionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies and Judicial\nLegitimacy, 91 Yale L. J. 635, 645 (1982)); see also Hutto,\n437 U. S., at 688 (noting “the interdependence of the con\nditions producing the violation,” including overcrowd\ning). Only a multifaceted approach aimed at many causes,\nincluding overcrowding, will yield a solution.\n   The PLRA should not be interpreted to place undue\nrestrictions on the authority of federal courts to fashion\npractical remedies when confronted with complex and\nintractable constitutional violations. Congress limited the\navailability of limits on prison populations, but it did not\nforbid these measures altogether. See 18 U. S. C. §3626.\nThe House Report accompanying the PLRA explained:\n       “While prison caps must be the remedy of last re\n     sort, a court still retains the power to order this\n     remedy despite its intrusive nature and harmful con\n     sequences to the public if, but only if, it is truly\n     necessary to prevent an actual violation of a prisoner’s\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    federal rights.” H. R. Rep. No. 104–21, p. 25 (1995).\nCourts should presume that Congress was sensitive to the\nreal-world problems faced by those who would remedy\nconstitutional violations in the prisons and that Congress\ndid not leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of\ntheir constitutional rights. A reading of the PLRA that\nwould render population limits unavailable in practice\nwould raise serious constitutional concerns. See, e.g.,\nBowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476\nU. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986). A finding that overcrowding\nis the “primary cause” of a violation is therefore permissi\nble, despite the fact that additional steps will be required\nto remedy the violation.\n                               C\n  The three-judge court was also required to find by clear\nand convincing evidence that “no other relief will remedy\nthe violation of the Federal right.” §3626(a)(3)(E)(ii).\n  The State argues that the violation could have been\nremedied through a combination of new construction,\ntransfers of prisoners out of State, hiring of medical per\nsonnel, and continued efforts by the Plata Receiver and\nColeman Special Master. The order in fact permits the\nState to comply with the population limit by transferring\nprisoners to county facilities or facilities in other States, or\nby constructing new facilities to raise the prisons’ design\ncapacity. And the three-judge court’s order does not bar\nthe State from undertaking any other remedial efforts. If\nthe State does find an adequate remedy other than a\npopulation limit, it may seek modification or termination\nof the three-judge court’s order on that basis. The evi\ndence at trial, however, supports the three-judge court’s\nconclusion that an order limited to other remedies would\nnot provide effective relief.\n  The State’s argument that out-of-state transfers provide\na less restrictive alternative to a population limit must fail\n30                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause requiring out-of-state transfers itself qualifies as\na population limit under the PLRA.9 Such an order “has\nthe purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison\npopulation, or . . . directs the release from or nonadmission\nof prisoners to a prison.” §3626(g)(4). The same is true of\ntransfers to county facilities. Transfers provide a means\nto reduce the prison population in compliance with the\nthree-judge court’s order. They are not a less restrictive\nalternative to that order.\n   Even if out-of-state transfers could be regarded as a less\nrestrictive alternative, the three-judge court found no\nevidence of plans for transfers in numbers sufficient to\nrelieve overcrowding. The State complains that the Cole\nman District Court slowed the rate of transfer by requir\ning inspections to assure that the receiving institutions\nwere in compliance with the Eighth Amendment, but the\nState has made no effort to show that it has the resources\nand the capacity to transfer significantly larger numbers\nof prisoners absent that condition.\n   Construction of new facilities, in theory, could alleviate\novercrowding, but the three-judge court found no realistic\npossibility that California would be able to build itself out\nof this crisis. At the time of the court’s decision the State\nhad plans to build new medical and housing facilities, but\nfunding for some plans had not been secured and funding\nfor other plans had been delayed by the legislature for\nyears. Particularly in light of California’s ongoing fiscal\ncrisis, the three-judge court deemed “chimerical” any\n“remedy that requires significant additional spending by\nthe state.” Juris. App. 151a. Events subsequent to the\n——————\n  9 A program of voluntary transfers by the State would, of course, be\n\nless restrictive than an order mandating a reduction in the prison\npopulation. In light of the State’s longstanding failure to remedy these\nserious constitutional violations, the three-judge court was under no\nobligation to consider voluntary population-reduction measures by the\nState as a workable alternative to injunctive relief.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthree-judge court’s decision have confirmed this conclu\nsion. In October 2010, the State notified the Coleman\nDistrict Court that a substantial component of its con\nstruction plans had been delayed indefinitely by the legis\nlature. And even if planned construction were to be\ncompleted, the Plata Receiver found that many so-called\n“expansion” plans called for cramming more prisoners into\nexisting prisons without expanding administrative and\nsupport facilities. Juris. App. 151a–152a. The former\nacting secretary of the California prisons explained that\nthese plans would “ ‘compound the burdens imposed on\nprison administrators and line staff’’ ” by adding to the\nalready overwhelming prison population, creating new\nbarriers to achievement of a remedy. Id., at 152a.\n  The three-judge court also rejected additional hiring as\na realistic means to achieve a remedy. The State for years\nhad been unable to fill positions necessary for the ade\nquate provision of medical and mental health care, and\nthe three-judge court found no reason to expect a change.\nAlthough the State points to limited gains in staffing\nbetween 2007 and 2008, the record shows that the prison\nsystem remained chronically understaffed through trial in\n2008. See supra, at 20. The three-judge court found that\nviolence and other negative conditions caused by crowding\nmade it difficult to hire and retain needed staff. The court\nalso concluded that there would be insufficient space for\nadditional staff to work even if adequate personnel could\nsomehow be retained. Additional staff cannot help to\nremedy the violation if they have no space in which to see\nand treat patients.\n  The three-judge court also did not err, much less commit\nclear error, when it concluded that, absent a population\nreduction, continued efforts by the Receiver and Special\nMaster would not achieve a remedy. Both the Receiver\nand the Special Master filed reports stating that over\ncrowding posed a significant barrier to their efforts. The\n32                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPlata Receiver stated that he was determined to achieve\na remedy even without a population reduction, but he\nwarned that such an effort would “all but bankrupt” the\nState. App. 1053. The Coleman Special Master noted\neven more serious concerns, stating that previous reme\ndial efforts had “succumbed to the inexorably rising tide of\npopulation.” App. 489. Both reports are persuasive evi\ndence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem\nedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least\nrequire vast expenditures of resources by the State. Noth\ning in the long history of the Coleman and Plata actions\ndemonstrates any real possibility that the necessary re\nsources would be made available.\n   The State claims that, even if each of these measures\nwere unlikely to remedy the violation, they would succeed\nin doing so if combined together. Aside from asserting this\nproposition, the State offers no reason to believe it is so.\nAttempts to remedy the violations in Plata have been\nongoing for 9 years. In Coleman, remedial efforts have\nbeen ongoing for 16. At one time, it may have been possi\nble to hope that these violations would be cured without a\nreduction in overcrowding. A long history of failed reme\ndial orders, together with substantial evidence of over\ncrowding’s deleterious effects on the provision of care,\ncompels a different conclusion today.\n   The common thread connecting the State’s proposed\nremedial efforts is that they would require the State to\nexpend large amounts of money absent a reduction in\novercrowding. The Court cannot ignore the political and\nfiscal reality behind this case. California’s Legislature has\nnot been willing or able to allocate the resources necessary\nto meet this crisis absent a reduction in overcrowding.\nThere is no reason to believe it will begin to do so now,\nwhen the State of California is facing an unprecedented\nbudgetary shortfall. As noted above, the legislature re\ncently failed to allocate funds for planned new construc\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Without a reduction in overcrowd\ning, there will be no efficacious remedy for the unconsti\ntutional care of the sick and mentally ill in California’s\nprisons.\n                             D\n  The PLRA states that no prospective relief shall issue\nwith respect to prison conditions unless it is narrowly\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of a federal right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation. 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a). When determining whether these requirements\nare met, courts must “give substantial weight to any ad\nverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system.” Ibid.\n                               1\n   The three-judge court acknowledged that its order “is\nlikely to affect inmates without medical conditions or\nserious mental illness.” Juris. App. 172a. This is because\nreducing California’s prison population will require reduc\ning the number of prisoners outside the class through\nsteps such as parole reform, sentencing reform, use of\ngood-time credits, or other means to be determined by the\nState. Reducing overcrowding will also have positive\neffects beyond facilitating timely and adequate access to\nmedical care, including reducing the incidence of prison\nviolence and ameliorating unsafe living conditions. Ac\ncording to the State, these collateral consequences are\nevidence that the order sweeps more broadly than\nnecessary.\n   The population limit imposed by the three-judge court\ndoes not fail narrow tailoring simply because it will have\npositive effects beyond the plaintiff class. Narrow tailor\ning requires a “ ‘ “fit” between the [remedy’s] ends and the\nmeans chosen to accomplish those ends.’ ” Board of Trus\n34                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480\n(1989). The scope of the remedy must be proportional\nto the scope of the violation, and the order must extend\nno further than necessary to remedy the violation. This\nCourt has rejected remedial orders that unnecessarily\nreach out to improve prison conditions other than those\nthat violate the Constitution. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.\n343, 357 (1996). But the precedents do not suggest that a\nnarrow and otherwise proper remedy for a constitutional\nviolation is invalid simply because it will have collateral\neffects.\n  Nor does anything in the text of the PLRA require that\nresult. The PLRA states that a remedy shall extend no\nfurther than necessary to remedy the violation of the\nrights of a “particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3626(a)(1)(A). This means only that the scope of the\norder must be determined with reference to the consti\ntutional violations established by the specific plaintiffs\nbefore the court.\n  This case is unlike cases where courts have impermis\nsibly reached out to control the treatment of persons or\ninstitutions beyond the scope of the violation. See Dayton\nBd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 420 (1977). Even\nprisoners with no present physical or mental illness may\nbecome afflicted, and all prisoners in California are at risk\nso long as the State continues to provide inadequate care.\nPrisoners in the general population will become sick, and\nwill become members of the plaintiff classes, with rou-\ntine frequency; and overcrowding may prevent the timely\ndiagnosis and care necessary to provide effective treat\nment and to prevent further spread of disease. Relief\ntargeted only at present members of the plaintiff classes\nmay therefore fail to adequately protect future class mem\nbers who will develop serious physical or mental illness.\nPrisoners who are not sick or mentally ill do not yet have a\nclaim that they have been subjected to care that violates\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

They are\nthat system’s next potential victims.\n   A release order limited to prisoners within the plaintiff\nclasses would, if anything, unduly limit the ability of State\nofficials to determine which prisoners should be released.\nAs the State acknowledges in its brief, “release of seriously\nmentally ill inmates [would be] likely to create special\ndangers because of their recidivism rates.” Consolidated\nReply Brief for Appellants 34. The order of the three\njudge court gives the State substantial flexibility to\ndetermine who should be released. If the State truly be\nlieves that a release order limited to sick and mentally ill\ninmates would be preferable to the order entered by the\nthree-judge court, the State can move the three-judge\ncourt for modification of the order on that basis. The State\nhas not requested this relief from this Court.\n   The order also is not overbroad because it encompasses\nthe entire prison system, rather than separately assessing\nthe need for a population limit at every institution. The\nColeman court found a systemwide violation when it first\nafforded relief, and in Plata the State stipulated to sys\ntemwide relief when it conceded the existence of a viola\ntion. Both the Coleman Special Master and the Plata\nReceiver have filed numerous reports detailing system\nwide deficiencies in medical and mental health care.\nCalifornia’s medical care program is run at a systemwide\nlevel, and resources are shared among the correctional\nfacilities.\n   Although the three-judge court’s order addresses the\nentire California prison system, it affords the State flexi\nbility to accommodate differences between institutions.\nThere is no requirement that every facility comply with\nthe 137.5% limit. Assuming no constitutional violation\nresults, some facilities may retain populations in excess of\nthe limit provided other facilities fall sufficiently below it\n36                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nso the system as a whole remains in compliance with the\norder. This will allow prison officials to shift prisoners\nto facilities that are better able to accommodate over\ncrowding, or out of facilities where retaining sufficient\nmedical staff has been difficult. The alternative—a series\nof institution-specific population limits—would require\nfederal judges to make these choices. Leaving this discre\ntion to state officials does not make the order overbroad.\n   Nor is the order overbroad because it limits the State’s\nauthority to run its prisons, as the State urges in its brief.\nWhile the order does in some respects shape or control the\nState’s authority in the realm of prison administration, it\ndoes so in a manner that leaves much to the State’s discre\ntion. The State may choose how to allocate prisoners\nbetween institutions; it may choose whether to increase\nthe prisons’ capacity through construction or reduce the\npopulation; and, if it does reduce the population, it may\ndecide what steps to take to achieve the necessary reduc\ntion. The order’s limited scope is necessary to remedy a\nconstitutional violation.\n   As the State implements the order of the three-judge\ncourt, time and experience may reveal targeted and effec\ntive remedies that will end the constitutional violations\neven without a significant decrease in the general prison\npopulation. The State will be free to move the three-judge\ncourt for modification of its order on that basis, and these\nmotions would be entitled to serious consideration. See\ninfra, at 45–48. At this time, the State has not proposed\nany realistic alternative to the order. The State’s desire to\navoid a population limit, justified as according respect to\nstate authority, creates a certain and unacceptable risk of\ncontinuing violations of the rights of sick and mentally ill\nprisoners, with the result that many more will die or\nneedlessly suffer. The Constitution does not permit this\nwrong.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          37\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              2\n   In reaching its decision, the three-judge court gave\n“substantial weight” to any potential adverse impact on\npublic safety from its order. The court devoted nearly 10\ndays of trial to the issue of public safety, and it gave the\nquestion extensive attention in its opinion. Ultimately,\nthe court concluded that it would be possible to reduce\nthe prison population “in a manner that preserves public\nsafety and the operation of the criminal justice system.”\nJuris. App. 247a–248a.\n   The PLRA’s requirement that a court give “substantial\nweight” to public safety does not require the court to cer\ntify that its order has no possible adverse impact on the\npublic. A contrary reading would depart from the statute’s\ntext by replacing the word “substantial” with “conclusive.”\nWhenever a court issues an order requiring the State to\nadjust its incarceration and criminal justice policy, there\nis a risk that the order will have some adverse impact on\npublic safety in some sectors. This is particularly true\nwhen the order requires release of prisoners before their\nsentence has been served. Persons incarcerated for even\none offense may have committed many other crimes prior\nto arrest and conviction, and some number can be ex\npected to commit further crimes upon release. Yet the\nPLRA contemplates that courts will retain authority to\nissue orders necessary to remedy constitutional violations,\nincluding authority to issue population limits when neces\nsary. See supra, at 28–29. A court is required to consider\nthe public safety consequences of its order and to struc\nture, and monitor, its ruling in a way that mitigates those\nconsequences while still achieving an effective remedy of\nthe constitutional violation.\n   This inquiry necessarily involves difficult predictive\njudgments regarding the likely effects of court orders.\nAlthough these judgments are normally made by state\nofficials, they necessarily must be made by courts when\n38                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthose courts fashion injunctive relief to remedy serious\nconstitutional violations in the prisons. These questions\nare difficult and sensitive, but they are factual questions\nand should be treated as such. Courts can, and should,\nrely on relevant and informed expert testimony when\nmaking factual findings. It was proper for the three-judge\ncourt to rely on the testimony of prison officials from\nCalifornia and other States. Those experts testified on the\nbasis of empirical evidence and extensive experience in\nthe field of prison administration.\n   The three-judge court credited substantial evidence that\nprison populations can be reduced in a manner that does\nnot increase crime to a significant degree. Some evidence\nindicated that reducing overcrowding in California’s pris\nons could even improve public safety. Then-Governor\nSchwarzenegger, in his emergency proclamation on over\ncrowding, acknowledged that “ ‘overcrowding causes harm\nto people and property, leads to inmate unrest and mis\nconduct, . . . and increases recidivism as shown within this\nstate and in others.’ ” Juris. App. 191a–192a. The former\nwarden of San Quentin and acting secretary of the Cali\nfornia prison system testified that she “ ‘absolutely be\nlieve[s] that we make people worse, and that we are not\nmeeting public safety by the way we treat people.’ ”10 Id.,\nat 129a. And the head of Pennsylvania’s correctional\nsystem testified that measures to reduce prison population\n——————\n  10 The former head of correctional systems in Washington, Maine, and\nPennsylvania, likewise referred to California’s prisons as “ ‘crimino\ngenic.’ ” Juris. App. 191a. The Yolo County chief probation officer\ntestified that “ ‘it seems like [the prisons] produce additional criminal\nbehavior.’ ” Id., at 190a. A former professor of sociology at George\nWashington University, reported that California’s present recidivism\nrate is among the highest in the Nation. App. 1246. And the three\njudge court noted the report of California’s Little Hoover Commission,\nwhich stated that “ ‘[e]ach year, California communities are burdened\nwith absorbing 123,000 offenders returning from prison, often more\ndangerous than when they left.’ ” Juris. App. 191a.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   39\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmay “actually improve on public safety because they ad\ndress the problems that brought people to jail.” Tr. 1552–\n1553.\n   Expert witnesses produced statistical evidence that\nprison populations had been lowered without adversely\naffecting public safety in a number of jurisdictions, includ\ning certain counties in California, as well as Wisconsin,\nIllinois, Texas, Colorado, Montana, Michigan, Florida, and\nCanada. Juris. App. 245a.11 Washington’s former secretary\nof corrections testified that his State had implemented\npopulation reduction methods, including parole reform\nand expansion of good time credits, without any “deleteri\nous effect on crime.” Tr. 2008–2009. In light of this evi\ndence, the three-judge court concluded that any negative\nimpact on public safety would be “substantially offset, and\nperhaps entirely eliminated, by the public safety benefits”\n——————\n   11 Philadelphia’s experience in the early 1990’s with a federal court\n\norder mandating reductions in the prison population was less positive,\nand that history illustrates the undoubted need for caution in this area.\nOne congressional witness testified that released prisoners committed\n79 murders and multiple other offenses. See Hearing on S. 3 et al.\nbefore the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n45 (1995) (statement of Lynne Abraham, District Attorney of Philadel\nphia). Lead counsel for the plaintiff class in that case responded that\n“[t]his inflammatory assertion has never been documented.” Id., at\n212 (statement of David Richman). The Philadelphia decree was also\ndifferent from the order entered in this case. Among other things, it\n“prohibited the City from admitting to its prisons any additional\ninmates, except for persons charged with, or convicted of, murder,\nforcible rape, or a crime involving the use of a gun or knife in the\ncommission of an aggravated assault or robbery.” Harris v. Reeves, 761\nF. Supp. 382, 384–385 (ED Pa. 1991); see also Crime and Justice\nResearch Institute, J. Goldkamp & M. White, Restoring Accountability\nin Pretrial Release: The Philadelphia Pretrial Release Supervision\nExperiments 6–8 (1998). The difficulty of determining the precise\nrelevance of Philadelphia’s experience illustrates why appellate courts\ndefer to the trier of fact. The three-judge court had the opportunity to\nhear testimony on population reduction measures in other jurisdictions\nand to ask relevant questions of informed expert witnesses.\n40                        BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof a reduction in overcrowding. Juris. App. 248a.\n   The court found that various available methods of re\nducing overcrowding would have little or no impact on\npublic safety. Expansion of good-time credits would allow\nthe State to give early release to only those prisoners who\npose the least risk of reoffending. Diverting low-risk\noffenders to community programs such as drug treatment,\nday reporting centers, and electronic monitoring would\nlikewise lower the prison population without releasing\nviolent convicts.12 The State now sends large numbers of\npersons to prison for violating a technical term or condi\ntion of their parole, and it could reduce the prison popula\ntion by punishing technical parole violations through\ncommunity-based programs. This last measure would be\nparticularly beneficial as it would reduce crowding in the\nreception centers, which are especially hard hit by over\ncrowding. See supra, at 23–24. The court’s order took\naccount of public safety concerns by giving the State sub\nstantial flexibility to select among these and other means\nof reducing overcrowding.\n   The State submitted a plan to reduce its prison popula\ntion in accordance with the three-judge court’s order, and\nit complains that the three-judge court approved that\nplan without considering whether the specific measures\ncontained within it would substantially threaten public\nsafety. The three-judge court, however, left the choice of\nhow best to comply with its population limit to state\n\n——————\n   12 Expanding such community-based measures may require an ex\n\npenditure of resources by the State to fund new programs or expand\nexisting ones. The State complains that the order therefore requires it\nto “divert” savings that will be achieved by reducing the prison popula\ntion and that setting budgetary priorities in this manner is a “severe,\nunlawful intrusion on the State authority.” Brief for Appellants 55.\nThis argument is not convincing. The order does not require the State\nto use any particular approach to reduce its prison population or\nallocate its resources.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           41\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprison officials. The court was not required to second\nguess the exercise of that discretion. Courts should pre\nsume that state officials are in a better position to gauge\nhow best to preserve public safety and balance competing\ncorrectional and law enforcement concerns. The decision\nto leave details of implementation to the State’s discretion\nprotected public safety by leaving sensitive policy deci\nsions to responsible and competent state officials.\n   During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact\nbegan to implement measures to reduce the prison popula\ntion. See Supp. Brief for Appellants 1. These measures\nwill shift “thousands” of prisoners from the state prisons\nto the county jails by “mak[ing] certain felonies punishable\nby imprisonment in county jail” and “requir[ing] that\nindividuals returned to custody for violating their condi\ntions of parole ‘serve any custody term in county jail.’ ”\nIbid. These developments support the three-judge court’s\nconclusion that the prison population can be reduced in\na manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on\npublic safety.\n                             III\n   Establishing the population at which the State could\nbegin to provide constitutionally adequate medical and\nmental health care, and the appropriate time frame within\nwhich to achieve the necessary reduction, requires a de\ngree of judgment. The inquiry involves uncertain predic\ntions regarding the effects of population reductions, as\nwell as difficult determinations regarding the capacity of\nprison officials to provide adequate care at various popu\nlation levels. Courts have substantial flexibility when\nmaking these judgments. “ ‘Once invoked, “the scope of a\ndistrict court’s equitable powers . . . is broad, for breadth\nand flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” ’ ”\nHutto, 437 U. S., at 687, n. 9 (quoting Milliken v. Bradley,\n433 U. S. 267, 281 (1977), in turn quoting Swann v.\n42                    BROWN v.

S. 1, 15 (1971)).\n   Nevertheless, the PLRA requires a court to adopt a\nremedy that is “narrowly tailored” to the constitutional\nviolation and that gives “substantial weight” to public\nsafety. 18 U. S. C. §3626(a). When a court is imposing a\npopulation limit, this means the court must set the limit\nat the highest population consistent with an efficacious\nremedy. The court must also order the population reduc\ntion achieved in the shortest period of time reasonably\nconsistent with public safety.\n                              A\n   The three-judge court concluded that the population of\nCalifornia’s prisons should be capped at 137.5% of design\ncapacity. This conclusion is supported by the record.\nIndeed, some evidence supported a limit as low as 100% of\ndesign capacity. The chief deputy secretary of Correc\ntional Healthcare Services for the California prisons tes\ntified that California’s prisons “ ‘were not designed and\nmade no provision for any expansion of medical care space\nbeyond the initial 100% of capacity.’ ” Juris. App. 176a.\nOther evidence supported a limit as low as 130%. The\nhead of the State’s Facilities Strike Team recommended\nreducing the population to 130% of design capacity as a\nlong-term goal. Id., at 179a–180a. A former head of cor\nrectional systems in Washington State, Maine, and Penn\nsylvania testified that a 130% limit would “ ‘give prison\nofficials and staff the ability to provide the necessary\nprograms and services for California’s prisoners.’ ” Id., at\n180a. A former executive director of the Texas prisons\ntestified that a limit of 130% was “ ‘realistic and appro\npriate’ ” and would “ ‘ensure that [California’s] prisons are\nsafe and provide legally required services.’ ” Ibid. And a\nformer acting secretary of the California prisons agreed\nwith a 130% limit with the caveat that a 130% limit might\nprove inadequate in some older facilities.

S. ____ (2011)           43\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   According to the State, this testimony expressed the\nwitnesses’ policy preferences, rather than their views as to\nwhat would cure the constitutional violation. Of course,\ncourts must not confuse professional standards with con\nstitutional requirements. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S.\n337, 348, n. 13 (1981). But expert opinion may be relevant\nwhen determining what is obtainable and what is accept\nable in corrections philosophy. See supra, at 37–38.\nNothing in the record indicates that the experts in this\ncase imposed their own policy views or lost sight of the\nunderlying violations. To the contrary, the witnesses\ntestified that a 130% population limit would allow the\nState to remedy the constitutionally inadequate provision\nof medical and mental health care. When expert opinion\nis addressed to the question of how to remedy the relevant\nconstitutional violations, as it was here, federal judges can\ngive it considerable weight.\n   The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has set 130% as a\nlong-term goal for population levels in the federal prison\nsystem. Brief for Appellants 43–44. The State suggests\nthe expert witnesses impermissibly adopted this profes\nsional standard in their testimony. But courts are not\nrequired to disregard expert opinion solely because it\nadopts or accords with professional standards. Profes\nsional standards may be “helpful and relevant with re\nspect to some questions.” Chapman, supra, at 348, n. 13.\nThe witnesses testified that a limit of 130% was necessary\nto remedy the constitutional violations, not that it should\nbe adopted because it is a BOP standard. If anything, the\nfact that the BOP views 130% as a manageable population\ndensity bolsters the three-judge court’s conclusion that a\npopulation limit of 130% would alleviate the pressures\nassociated with overcrowding and allow the State to begin\nto provide constitutionally adequate care.\n   Although the three-judge court concluded that the “evi\ndence in support of a 130% limit is strong,” it found that\n44                   BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome upward adjustment was warranted in light of “the\ncaution and restraint required by the PLRA.” Juris. App.\n183a, 184a. The three-judge court noted evidence support\ning a higher limit. In particular, the State’s Corrections\nIndependent Review Panel had found that 145% was the\nmaximum “operable capacity” of California’s prisons, id.,\nat 181a–182a, although the relevance of that determina\ntion was undermined by the fact that the panel had not\nconsidered the need to provide constitutionally adequate\nmedical and mental health care, as the State itself con\ncedes. Brief for Coleman Appellees 45. After considering,\nbut discounting, this evidence, the three-judge court con\ncluded that the evidence supported a limit lower than\n145%, but higher than 130%. It therefore imposed a limit\nof 137.5%.\n   This weighing of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.\nThe adversary system afforded the court an opportunity\nto weigh and evaluate evidence presented by the parties.\nThe plaintiffs’ evidentiary showing was intended to justify\na limit of 130%, and the State made no attempt to show\nthat any other number would allow for a remedy. There\nare also no scientific tools available to determine the\nprecise population reduction necessary to remedy a consti\ntutional violation of this sort. The three-judge court made\nthe most precise determination it could in light of the\nrecord before it. The PLRA’s narrow tailoring require\nment is satisfied so long as these equitable, remedial\njudgments are made with the objective of releasing the\nfewest possible prisoners consistent with an efficacious\nremedy. In light of substantial evidence supporting an\neven more drastic remedy, the three-judge court complied\nwith the requirement of the PLRA in this case.\n                            B\n  The three-judge court ordered the State to achieve this\nreduction within two years.

S. ____ (2011)           45\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the three-judge court, the State did not argue that\nreductions should occur over a longer period of time. The\nState later submitted a plan for court approval that would\nachieve the required reduction within five years, and that\nwould reduce the prison population to 151% of design\ncapacity in two years. The State represented that this\nplan would “safely reach a population level of 137.5% over\ntime.” App. to Juris. Statement 32a. The three-judge\ncourt rejected this plan because it did not comply with the\ndeadline set by its order.\n   The State first had notice that it would be required to\nreduce its prison population in February 2009, when the\nthree-judge court gave notice of its tentative ruling after\ntrial. The 2-year deadline, however, will not begin to run\nuntil this Court issues its judgment. When that happens,\nthe State will have already had over two years to begin\ncomplying with the order of the three-judge court. The\nState has used the time productively. At oral argument,\nthe State indicated it had reduced its prison population\nby approximately 9,000 persons since the decision of the\nthree-judge court. After oral argument, the State filed a\nsupplemental brief indicating that it had begun to imple\nment measures to shift “thousands” of additional prisoners\nto county facilities. Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1.\n   Particularly in light of the State’s failure to contest the\nissue at trial, the three-judge court did not err when\nit established a 2-year deadline for relief. Plaintiffs pro\nposed a 2-year deadline, and the evidence at trial was\nintended to demonstrate the feasibility of a 2-year dead\nline. See Tr. 2979. Notably, the State has not asked this\nCourt to extend the 2-year deadline at this time.\n   The three-judge court, however, retains the authority,\nand the responsibility, to make further amendments to the\nexisting order or any modified decree it may enter as\nwarranted by the exercise of its sound discretion. “The\npower of a court of equity to modify a decree of injunctive\n46                    BROWN v.

In order to “give substantial weight to any adverse\nimpact on public safety,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A), the\nthree-judge court must give due deference to informed\nopinions as to what public safety requires, including the\nconsidered determinations of state officials regarding\nthe time in which a reduction in the prison population can\nbe achieved consistent with public safety. An extension of\ntime may allow the State to consider changing political,\neconomic, and other circumstances and to take advantage\nof opportunities for more effective remedies that arise as\nthe Special Master, the Receiver, the prison system, and\nthe three-judge court itself evaluate the progress being\nmade to correct unconstitutional conditions.

The three-judge\ncourt may grant such a request provided that the State\nsatisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed\nto ensure that measures are taken to implement the plan\nwithout undue delay. Appropriate preconditions may\ninclude a requirement that the State demonstrate that it\nhas the authority and the resources necessary to achieve\nthe required reduction within a 5-year period and to meet\nreasonable interim directives for population reduction.\nThe three-judge court may also condition an extension of\ntime on the State’s ability to meet interim benchmarks for\nimprovement in provision of medical and mental health\ncare.\n  The three-judge court, in its discretion, may also con\nsider whether it is appropriate to order the State to begin\nwithout delay to develop a system to identify prisoners\nwho are unlikely to reoffend or who might otherwise be\ncandidates for early release. Even with an extension of\ntime to construct new facilities and implement other\nreforms, it may become necessary to release prisoners to\ncomply with the court’s order. To do so safely, the State\nshould devise systems to select those prisoners least likely\nto jeopardize public safety. An extension of time may\nprovide the State a greater opportunity to refine and elab\norate those systems.\n  The State has already made significant progress toward\nreducing its prison population, including reforms that will\nresult in shifting “thousands” of prisoners to county jails.\nSee Supp. Brief for Appellants at 1. As the State makes\nfurther progress, the three-judge court should evaluate\nwhether its order remains appropriate. If significant\nprogress is made toward remedying the underlying consti\ntutional violations, that progress may demonstrate that\nfurther population reductions are not necessary or are less\n48                    BROWN v.

Were the State to make\nthis showing, the three-judge court in the exercise of its\ndiscretion could consider whether it is appropriate to ex\ntend or modify this timeline.\n   Experience with the three-judge court’s order may also\nlead the State to suggest other modifications. The three\njudge court should give any such requests serious consid\neration. The three-judge court should also formulate its\norders to allow the State and its officials the authority\nnecessary to address contingencies that may arise during\nthe remedial process.\n   These observations reflect the fact that the three-judge\ncourt’s order, like all continuing equitable decrees, must\nremain open to appropriate modification. They are not\nintended to cast doubt on the validity of the basic premise\nof the existing order. The medical and mental health care\nprovided by California’s prisons falls below the standard of\ndecency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment. This\nextensive and ongoing constitutional violation requires\na remedy, and a remedy will not be achieved without a\nreduction in overcrowding.

One would think that, before\nallowing the decree of a federal district court to release\n46,000 convicted felons, this Court would bend every effort\nto read the law in such a way as to avoid that outrageous\nresult. Today, quite to the contrary, the Court disregards\nstringently drawn provisions of the governing statute, and\ntraditional constitutional limitations upon the power of a\nfederal judge, in order to uphold the absurd.\n  The proceedings that led to this result were a judicial\ntravesty. I dissent because the institutional reform the\nDistrict Court has undertaken violates the terms of the gov\nerning statute, ignores bedrock limitations on the power\nof Article III judges, and takes federal courts wildly\nbeyond their institutional capacity.\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                                I\n\n                               A\n\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that\n“[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to\nprison conditions shall extend no further than necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular\nplaintiff or plaintiffs”; that such relief must be “narrowly\ndrawn, [and] exten[d] no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation of the Federal right”; and that it must be “the\nleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). In deciding\nwhether these multiple limitations have been complied\nwith, it is necessary to identify with precision what is the\n“violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or\nplaintiffs” that has been alleged. What has been alleged\nhere, and what the injunction issued by the Court is\ntailored (narrowly or not) to remedy is the running of a\nprison system with inadequate medical facilities. That\nmay result in the denial of needed medical treatment to “a\nparticular [prisoner] or [prisoners],” thereby violating (ac\ncording to our cases) his or their Eighth Amendment\nrights. But the mere existence of the inadequate system\ndoes not subject to cruel and unusual punishment the\nentire prison population in need of medical care, including\nthose who receive it.\n  The Court acknowledges that the plaintiffs “do not base\ntheir case on deficiencies in care provided on any one\noccasion”; rather, “[p]laintiffs rely on systemwide deficien\ncies in the provision of medical and mental health care\nthat, taken as a whole, subject sick and mentally ill pris\noners in California to ‘substantial risk of serious harm’\nand cause the delivery of care in the prisons to fall below\nthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress\nof a maturing society.” Ante, at 7, n. 3. But our judge\nempowering “evolving standards of decency” jurisprudence\n(with which, by the way, I heartily disagree, see, e.g.,\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. 551, 615–616 (2005) (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting)) does not prescribe (or at least has not until\ntoday prescribed) rules for the “decent” running of schools,\nprisons, and other government institutions. It forbids\n“indecent” treatment of individuals—in the context of this\ncase, the denial of medical care to those who need it. And\nthe persons who have a constitutional claim for denial of\nmedical care are those who are denied medical care—not\nall who face a “substantial risk” (whatever that is) of being\ndenied medical care.\n   The Coleman litigation involves “the class of seriously\nmentally ill persons in California prisons,” ante, at 8, and\nthe Plata litigation involves “the class of state prisoners\nwith serious medical conditions,” ante, at 9. The plaintiffs\ndo not appear to claim—and it would absurd to suggest—\nthat every single one of those prisoners has personally\nexperienced “torture or a lingering death,” ante, at 13\n(internal quotation marks omitted), as a consequence of\nthat bad medical system. Indeed, it is inconceivable that\nanything more than a small proportion of prisoners in\nthe plaintiff classes have personally received sufficiently\natrocious treatment that their Eighth Amendment right\nwas violated—which, as the Court recognizes, is why the\nplaintiffs do not premise their claim on “deficiencies in\ncare provided on any one occasion.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.\nRather, the plaintiffs’ claim is that they are all part of a\nmedical system so defective that some number of prisoners\nwill inevitably be injured by incompetent medical care,\nand that this number is sufficiently high so as to render\nthe system, as a whole, unconstitutional.\n   But what procedural principle justifies certifying a class\nof plaintiffs so they may assert a claim of systemic uncon\nstitutionality? I can think of two possibilities, both of\nwhich are untenable. The first is that although some or\nmost plaintiffs in the class do not individually have viable\nEighth Amendment claims, the class as a whole has collec\n4                      BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntively suffered an Eighth Amendment violation. That\ntheory is contrary to the bedrock rule that the sole purpose\nof classwide adjudication is to aggregate claims that are\nindividually viable. “A class action, no less than tradi\ntional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a\nfederal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at\nonce, instead of in separate suits. And like traditional\njoinder, it leaves the parties’ legal rights and duties intact\nand the rules of decision unchanged.” Shady Grove Or\nthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 14).\n   The second possibility is that every member of the plain\ntiff class has suffered an Eighth Amendment violation\nmerely by virtue of being a patient in a poorly-run prison\nsystem, and the purpose of the class is merely to aggregate\nall those individually viable claims. This theory has the\nvirtue of being consistent with procedural principles, but\nat the cost of a gross substantive departure from our case\nlaw. Under this theory, each and every prisoner who\nhappens to be a patient in a system that has systemic\nweaknesses—such as “hir[ing] any doctor who had a li\ncense, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ante, at 10 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—has suffered cruel or unusual\npunishment, even if that person cannot make an individu\nalized showing of mistreatment. Such a theory of the\nEighth Amendment is preposterous. And we have said as\nmuch in the past: “If . . . a healthy inmate who had suf\nfered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were\nable to claim violation of his constitutional right to medi\ncal care . . . simply on the ground that the prison medical\nfacilities were inadequate, the essential distinction be\ntween judge and executive would have disappeared: it\nwould have become the function of the courts to assure\nadequate medical care in prisons.” Lewis v. Casey, 518\nU. S. 343, 350 (1996).\n    Whether procedurally wrong or substantively wrong,\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe notion that the plaintiff class can allege an Eighth\nAmendment violation based on “systemwide deficiencies”\nis assuredly wrong. It follows that the remedy decreed\nhere is also contrary to law, since the theory of systemic\nunconstitutionality is central to the plaintiffs’ case. The\nPLRA requires plaintiffs to establish that the systemwide\ninjunction entered by the District Court was “narrowly\ndrawn” and “extends no further than necessary” to correct\n“the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff\nor plaintiffs.” If (as is the case) the only viable constitu\ntional claims consist of individual instances of mistreat\nment, then a remedy reforming the system as a whole goes\nfar beyond what the statute allows.\n   It is also worth noting the peculiarity that the vast\nmajority of inmates most generously rewarded by the re\nlease order—the 46,000 whose incarceration will be ended—\ndo not form part of any aggrieved class even under the\nCourt’s expansive notion of constitutional violation. Most\nof them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or\nsevere mental illness; and many will undoubtedly be fine\nphysical specimens who have developed intimidating\nmuscles pumping iron in the prison gym.\n                             B\n  Even if I accepted the implausible premise that the\nplaintiffs have established a systemwide violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment, I would dissent from the Court’s\nendorsement of a decrowding order. That order is an\nexample of what has become known as a “structural in\njunction.” As I have previously explained, structural\ninjunctions are radically different from the injunctions\ntraditionally issued by courts of equity, and presumably\npart of “the judicial Power” conferred on federal courts by\nArticle III:\n    “The mandatory injunctions issued upon termination\n    of litigation usually required ‘a single simple act.’ H.\n6                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    McClintock, Principles of Equity §15, pp. 32–33 (2d\n    ed. 1948). Indeed, there was a ‘historical prejudice of\n    the court of chancery against rendering decrees which\n    called for more than a single affirmative act.’ Id., §61,\n    at 160. And where specific performance of contracts\n    was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree\n    would issue that required ongoing supervision. . . .\n    Compliance with these ‘single act’ mandates could, in\n    addition to being simple, be quick; and once it was\n    achieved the contemnor’s relationship with the court\n    came to an end, at least insofar as the subject of the\n    order was concerned. Once the document was turned\n    over or the land conveyed, the litigant’s obligation to\n    the court, and the court’s coercive power over the liti\n    gant, ceased. . . . The court did not engage in any on\n    going supervision of the litigant’s conduct, nor did its\n    order continue to regulate its behavior.” Mine Work\n    ers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 841–842 (1994) (SCALIA,\n    J., concurring).\n   Structural injunctions depart from that historical prac\ntice, turning judges into long-term administrators of\ncomplex social institutions such as schools, prisons, and\npolice departments. Indeed, they require judges to play a\nrole essentially indistinguishable from the role ordinarily\nplayed by executive officials. Today’s decision not only\naffirms the structural injunction but vastly expands its\nuse, by holding that an entire system is unconstitutional\nbecause it may produce constitutional violations.\n   The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been\ndescribed at great length elsewhere. See, e.g., Lewis,\nsupra, at 385–393 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring); Mis\nsouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 124–133 (1995) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring); Horowitz, Decreeing Organizational\nChange: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983\nDuke L. J. 1265.

The factfinding judges tradition\nally engage in involves the determination of past or pre\nsent facts based (except for a limited set of materials of\nwhich courts may take “judicial notice”) exclusively upon\na closed trial record. That is one reason why a district\njudge’s factual findings are entitled to plain-error review:\nbecause having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better\nposition to evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a\ncold record. In a very limited category of cases, judges\nhave also traditionally been called upon to make some\npredictive judgments: which custody will best serve the\ninterests of the child, for example, or whether a particular\none-shot injunction will remedy the plaintiff’s grievance.\nWhen a judge manages a structural injunction, however,\nhe will inevitably be required to make very broad empiri\ncal predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy\nviews—the sort of predictions regularly made by legis\nlators and executive officials, but inappropriate for the\nThird Branch.\n   This feature of structural injunctions is superbly illus\ntrated by the District Court’s proceeding concerning the\ndecrowding order’s effect on public safety. The PLRA\nrequires that, before granting “[p]rospective relief in [a]\ncivil action with respect to prison conditions,” a court must\n“give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public\nsafety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused\nby the relief.” 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). Here, the Dis\ntrict Court discharged that requirement by making the\n“factual finding” that “the state has available methods by\nwhich it could readily reduce the prison population to\n137.5% design capacity or less without an adverse impact\non public safety or the operation of the criminal justice\nsystem.” Juris.

It “reject[ed] the testimony that inmates\nreleased early from prison would commit additional new\ncrimes,” id., at 200a, finding that “shortening the length of\nstay through earned credits would give inmates incentives\nto participate in programming designed to lower recidi\nvism,” id., at 204a, and that “slowing the flow of technical\nparole violators to prison, thereby substantially reducing\nthe churning of parolees, would by itself improve both\nthe prison and parole systems, and public safety.” Id., at\n209a. It found that “the diversion of offenders to commu\nnity correctional programs has significant beneficial ef\nfects on public safety,” id., at 214a, and that “additional\nrehabilitative programming would result in a significant\npopulation reduction while improving public safety,” id., at\n216a.\n   The District Court cast these predictions (and the Court\ntoday accepts them) as “factual findings,” made in reliance\non the procession of expert witnesses that testified at trial.\nBecause these “findings” have support in the record, it is\ndifficult to reverse them under a plain-error standard of\nreview. Ante, at 38. And given that the District Court\ndevoted nearly 10 days of trial and 70 pages of its opinion\nto this issue, it is difficult to dispute that the District\nCourt has discharged its statutory obligation to give “sub\nstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety.”\n   But the idea that the three District Judges in this case\nrelied solely on the credibility of the testifying expert\nwitnesses is fanciful. Of course they were relying largely\non their own beliefs about penology and recidivism. And\nof course different district judges, of different policy views,\nwould have “found” that rehabilitation would not work\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand that releasing prisoners would increase the crime\nrate. I am not saying that the District Judges rendered\ntheir factual findings in bad faith. I am saying that it is\nimpossible for judges to make “factual findings” without\ninserting their own policy judgments, when the factual\nfindings are policy judgments. What occurred here is no\nmore judicial factfinding in the ordinary sense than would\nbe the factual findings that deficit spending will not lower\nthe unemployment rate, or that the continued occupation\nof Iraq will decrease the risk of terrorism. Yet, because\nthey have been branded “factual findings” entitled to\ndeferential review, the policy preferences of three District\nJudges now govern the operation of California’s penal\nsystem.\n   It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of pol\nicy judgments as factual findings is not an error pecu-\nliar to this case. It is an unavoidable concomitant of insti\ntutional-reform litigation. When a district court issues an\ninjunction, it must make a factual assessment of the an\nticipated consequences of the injunction. And when the\ninjunction undertakes to restructure a social institution,\nassessing the factual consequences of the injunction is\nnecessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our sys\ntem of government allocates to other government officials.\n   But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges to\nindulge policy preferences. They invite judges to indulge\nincompetent policy preferences. Three years of law school\nand familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents\ngive no insight whatsoever into the management of social\ninstitutions. Thus, in the proceeding below the District\nCourt determined that constitutionally adequate medical\nservices could be provided if the prison population was\n137.5% of design capacity. This was an empirical finding\nit was utterly unqualified to make. Admittedly, the court\ndid not generate that number entirely on its own; it heard\nthe numbers 130% and 145% bandied about by various\n10                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwitnesses and decided to split the difference. But the\nability of judges to spit back or even average-out numbers\nspoon-fed to them by expert witnesses does not render\nthem competent decisionmakers in areas in which they\nare otherwise unqualified.\n   The District Court also relied heavily on the views of the\nReceiver and Special Master, and those reports play a\nstarring role in the Court’s opinion today. The Court notes\nthat “the Receiver and the Special Master filed reports\nstating that overcrowding posed a significant barrier to\ntheir efforts” and deems those reports “persuasive evi\ndence that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, any rem\nedy might prove unattainable and would at the very least\nrequire vast expenditures of resources by the State.” Ante,\nat 31–32. The use of these reports is even less consonant\nwith the traditional judicial role than the District Court’s\nreliance on the expert testimony at trial. The latter, even\nwhen, as here, it is largely the expression of policy judg\nments, is at least subject to cross-examination. Relying on\nthe un-cross-examined findings of an investigator, sent\ninto the field to prepare a factual report and give sugges\ntions on how to improve the prison system, bears no re\nsemblance to ordinary judicial decisionmaking. It is true\nthat the PLRA contemplates the appointment of Special\nMasters (although not Receivers), but Special Masters are\nauthorized only to “conduct hearings and prepare pro\nposed findings of fact” and “assist in the development of\nremedial plans,” 18 U. S. C. §3626(f)(6). This does not\nauthorize them to make factual findings (unconnected to\nhearings) that are given seemingly wholesale deference.\nNeither the Receiver nor the Special Master was selected\nby California to run its prisons, and the fact that they may\nbe experts in the field of prison reform does not justify the\njudicial imposition of their perspectives on the state.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

As we have previ\nously recognized:\n    “[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly\n    urgent problems of prison administration and re-\n    form. . . . [T]he problems of prisons in America are\n    complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they\n    are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. . . .\n    Running a prison is an inordinately difficult under\n    taking that requires expertise, planning, and the com\n    mitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly\n    within the province of the legislative and executive\n    branches of government. Prison is, moreover, a task\n    that has been committed to the responsibility of those\n    branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a\n    policy of judicial restraint. Where a state penal sys\n    tem is involved, federal courts have . . . additional\n    reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison\n    authorities.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84–85\n    (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   These principles apply doubly to a prisoner-release\norder. As the author of today’s opinion explained earlier\nthis Term, granting a writ of habeas corpus “ ‘disturbs the\nState’s significant interest in repose for concluded litiga\ntion, denies society the right to punish some admitted\noffenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree\nmatched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.’ ”\nHarrington v.

And yet\nhere, the Court affirms an order granting the functional\nequivalent of 46,000 writs of habeas corpus, based on its\npaean to courts’ “substantial flexibility when making these\njudgments.” Ante, at 41. It seems that the Court’s respect\nfor state sovereignty has vanished in the case where it\nmost matters.\n                              II\n   The Court’s opinion includes a bizarre coda noting\nthat “[t]he State may wish to move for modification of the\nthree-judge court’s order to extend the deadline for the\nrequired reduction to five years.” Ante, at 46–47. The Dis\ntrict Court, it says, “may grant such a request provided\nthat the State satisfies necessary and appropriate precon\nditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to\nimplement the plan without undue delay”; and it gives\nvague suggestions of what these preconditions “may in\nclude,” such as “interim benchmarks.” Ante, at 47. It also\ninvites the District Court to “consider whether it is appro\npriate to order the State to begin without delay to develop\na system to identify prisoners who are unlikely to reof\nfend,” and informs the State that it “should devise systems\nto select those prisoners least likely to jeopardize public\nsafety.” Ibid. (What a good idea!)\n   The legal effect of this passage is unclear—I suspect\nintentionally so. If it is nothing but a polite remainder to\nthe State and to the District Court that the injunction is\nsubject to modification, then it is entirely unnecessary. As\nboth the State and the District Court are undoubtedly\naware, a party is always entitled to move to modify an\nequitable decree, and the PLRA contains an express provi\nsion authorizing District Courts to modify or terminate\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

C. §3626(b).\n   I suspect, however, that this passage is a warning shot\nacross the bow, telling the District Court that it had better\nmodify the injunction if the State requests what we invite\nit to request. Such a warning, if successful, would achieve\nthe benefit of a marginal reduction in the inevitable mur\nders, robberies, and rapes to be committed by the released\ninmates. But it would achieve that at the expense of in\ntellectual bankruptcy, as the Court’s “warning” is en-\ntirely alien to ordinary principles of appellate review of\ninjunctions. When a party moves for modification of\nan injunction, the district court is entitled to rule on that\nmotion first, subject to review for abuse of discretion if it\ndeclines to modify the order. Horne v. Flores, 557 U. S.\n___, ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10, 20). Moreover, when a\ndistrict court enters a new decree with new benchmarks,\nthe selection of those benchmarks is also reviewed under\na deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of review—a\npoint the Court appears to recognize. Ante, at 45. Appel\nlate courts are not supposed to “affirm” injunctions while\npreemptively noting that the State “may” request, and the\nDistrict Court “may” grant, a request to extend the State’s\ndeadline to release prisoners by three years based on some\nsuggestions on what appropriate preconditions for such a\nmodification “may” include.\n   Of course what is really happening here is that the\nCourt, overcome by common sense, disapproves of the\nresults reached by the District Court, but cannot remedy\nthem (it thinks) by applying ordinary standards of appel\nlate review. It has therefore selected a solution unknown\nin our legal system: A deliberately ambiguous set of sug\ngestions on how to modify the injunction, just deferential\nenough so that it can say with a straight face that it is\n“affirming,” just stern enough to put the District Court on\nnotice that it will likely get reversed if it does not follow\nthem. In doing this, the Court has aggrandized itself,\n14                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ngrasping authority that appellate courts are not supposed\nto have, and using it to enact a compromise solution with\nno legal basis other than the Court’s say-so. That we are\ndriven to engage in these extralegal activities should be a\nsign that the entire project of permitting district courts to\nrun prison systems is misbegotten.\n  But perhaps I am being too unkind. The Court, or at\nleast a majority of the Court’s majority, must be aware\nthat the judges of the District Court are likely to call its\nbluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly be an\nabuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State’s proposed\nmodifications in an injunction that has just been approved\n(affirmed) in its present form. An injunction, after all,\ndoes not have to be perfect; only good enough for govern\nment work, which the Court today says this is. So perhaps\nthe coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the\nhands—making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible\nthings sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous\norder do happen, they will be none of this Court’s respon\nsibility. After all, did we not want, and indeed even sug\ngest, something better?\n                              III\n   In view of the incoherence of the Eighth Amendment\nclaim at the core of this case, the nonjudicial features of\ninstitutional reform litigation that this case exemplifies,\nand the unique concerns associated with mass prisoner\nreleases, I do not believe this Court can affirm this injunc\ntion. I will state my approach briefly: In my view, a court\nmay not order a prisoner’s release unless it determines\nthat the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his consti\ntutional rights, and that his release, and no other relief,\nwill remedy that violation. Thus, if the court determines\nthat a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally\nrequired medical treatment, and the release of that pris\noner (and no other remedy) would enable him to obtain\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   15\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmedical treatment, then the court can order his release;\nbut a court may not order the release of prisoners who\nhave suffered no violations of their constitutional rights,\nmerely to make it less likely that that will happen to them\nin the future.\n  This view follows from the PLRA’s text that I discussed\nat the outset, 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). “[N]arrowly\ndrawn” means that the relief applies only to the “particu\nlar [prisoner] or [prisoners]” whose constitutional rights\nare violated; “extends no further than necessary” means\nthat prisoners whose rights are not violated will not obtain\nrelief; and “least intrusive means necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right” means that no other relief is\navailable.*\n  I acknowledge that this reading of the PLRA would se\nverely limit the circumstances under which a court could\nissue structural injunctions to remedy allegedly unconsti\ntutional prison conditions, although it would not eliminate\nthem entirely. If, for instance, a class representing all\nprisoners in a particular institution alleged that the tem\nperature in their cells was so cold as to violate the Eighth\nAmendment, or that they were deprived of all exercise\ntime, a court could enter a prisonwide injunction ordering\nthat the temperature be raised or exercise time be pro\nvided. Still, my approach may invite the objection that the\nPLRA appears to contemplate structural injunctions in\ngeneral and mass prisoner-release orders in particular.\nThe statute requires courts to “give substantial weight to\n——————\n  * Any doubt on this last score, at least as far as prisoner-release or\nders are concerned, is eliminated by §3626(a)(3)(E) of the statute, which\nprovides that to enter a prisoner-release order the court must find\n  “by clear and convincing evidence that—\n  (i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right;\nand\n  (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.”\n16                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nany adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a\ncriminal justice system caused by the relief” and author\nizes them to appoint Special Masters, §3626 (a)(1)(A), (f),\nprovisions that seem to presuppose the possibility of a\nstructural remedy. It also sets forth criteria under which\ncourts may issue orders that have “the purpose or effect of\nreducing or limiting the prisoner population,” §3626(g)(4).\n   I do not believe that objection carries the day. In addi\ntion to imposing numerous limitations on the ability of\ndistrict courts to order injunctive relief with respect to\nprison conditions, the PLRA states that “[n]othing in this\nsection shall be construed to . . . repeal or detract from\notherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of\nthe courts.” §3626(a)(1)(C). The PLRA is therefore best\nunderstood as an attempt to constrain the discretion of\ncourts issuing structural injunctions—not as a mandate\nfor their use. For the reasons I have outlined, structural\ninjunctions, especially prisoner-release orders, raise grave\nseparation-of-powers concerns and veer significantly from\nthe historical role and institutional capability of courts. It\nis appropriate to construe the PLRA so as to constrain\ncourts from entering injunctive relief that would exceed\nthat role and capability.\n                        *     *    *\n  The District Court’s order that California release 46,000\nprisoners extends “further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or\nplaintiffs” who have been denied needed medical care. 18\nU. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). It is accordingly forbidden by the\nPLRA—besides defying all sound conception of the proper\nrole of judges.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Decisions regarding\nstate prisons have profound public safety and financial\nimplications, and the States are generally free to make\nthese decisions as they choose. See Turner v. Safley, 482\nU. S. 78, 85 (1987).\n  The Eighth Amendment imposes an important—but\nlimited—restraint on state authority in this field. The\nEighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from de-\npriving inmates of “the minimal civilized measure of life’s\nnecessities.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 347\n(1981). Federal courts have the responsibility to ensure\nthat this constitutional standard is met, but undesirable\nprison conditions that do not violate the Constitution are\nbeyond the federal courts’ reach.\n  In this case, a three-judge court exceeded its authority\nunder the Constitution and the PLRA. The court ordered\na radical reduction in the California prison population\n2                     BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwithout finding that the current population level violates\nthe Constitution.\n   Two cases were before the three-judge court, and neither\ntargeted the general problem of overcrowding. Indeed, the\nplaintiffs in one of those cases readily acknowledge that\nthe current population level is not itself unconstitutional.\nBrief for Coleman Appellees 56. Both of the cases were\nbrought not on behalf of all inmates subjected to over\ncrowding, but rather in the interests of much more limited\nclasses of prisoners, namely, those needing mental health\ntreatment and those with other serious medical needs.\nBut these cases were used as a springboard to implement\na criminal justice program far different from that chosen\nby the state legislature. Instead of crafting a remedy to\nattack the specific constitutional violations that were\nfound—which related solely to prisoners in the two plain\ntiff classes—the lower court issued a decree that will at\nbest provide only modest help to those prisoners but that\nis very likely to have a major and deleterious effect on\npublic safety.\n   The three-judge court ordered the premature release of\napproximately 46,000 criminals—the equivalent of three\nArmy divisions.\n   The approach taken by the three-judge court flies in the\nface of the PLRA. Contrary to the PLRA, the court’s rem\nedy is not narrowly tailored to address proven and ongoing\nconstitutional violations. And the three-judge court vio\nlated the PLRA’s critical command that any court con\ntemplating a prisoner release order must give “substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety.” 18\nU. S. C. §3626(a)(1)(A). The three-judge court would have\nus believe that the early release of 46,000 inmates will not\nimperil—and will actually improve—public safety. Juris.\nStatement App., O.

First, the three-judge court improperly refused\nto consider evidence concerning present conditions in the\nCalifornia prison system. Second, the court erred in hold\ning that no remedy short of a massive prisoner release can\nbring the California system into compliance with the\nEighth Amendment. Third, the court gave inadequate\nweight to the impact of its decree on public safety.\n                                I\n   Both the PLRA and general principles concerning in\njunctive relief dictate that a prisoner release order cannot\nproperly be issued unless the relief is necessary to remedy\nan ongoing violation. Under the PLRA, a prisoner release\nmay be decreed only if crowding “is the primary cause” of\nan Eighth Amendment violation and only if no other re\nlief “will remedy” the violation. §3626(a)(3)(E) (emphasis\nadded). This language makes it clear that proof of past\nviolations alone is insufficient to justify a court-ordered\nprisoner release.\n   Similarly, in cases not governed by the PLRA, we have\nheld that an inmate seeking an injunction to prevent a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment must show that prison\nofficials are “knowingly and unreasonably disregarding an\nobjectively intolerable risk of harm, and that they will\ncontinue to do so . . . into the future.” Farmer v. Brennan,\n511 U. S. 825, 846 (1994). The “deliberate indifference”\nneeded to establish an Eighth Amendment violation must\nbe examined “in light of the prison authorities’ current\nattitudes and conduct,” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25,\n36 (1993), which means “their attitudes and conduct at the\ntime suit is brought and persisting thereafter,” Farmer,\nsupra, at 845.\n   For these reasons, the propriety of the relief ordered\nhere cannot be assessed without ascertaining the nature\nand scope of any ongoing constitutional violations. Proof\n4                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nof past violations will not do; nor is it sufficient simply\nto establish that some violations continue. The scope of\npermissible relief depends on the scope of any continuing\nviolations, and therefore it was essential for the three\njudge court to make a reliable determination of the extent\nof any violations as of the time its release order was is\nsued. Particularly in light of the radical nature of its\nchosen remedy, nothing less than an up-to-date assess\nment was tolerable.\n   The three-judge court, however, relied heavily on out\ndated information and findings and refused to permit\nCalifornia to introduce new evidence. Despite evidence of\nimprovement,1 the three-judge court relied on old findings\nmade by the single-judge courts, see Juris. App. 76a–77a,\nincluding a finding made 14 years earlier, see id., at 170a\n(citing Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1316, 1319\n(ED Cal. 1995)). The three-judge court highlighted death\nstatistics from 2005, see Juris. App. 9a, while ignoring the\n“significant and continuous decline since 2006,” California\nPrison Health Care Receivership Corp., K. Imai, Analysis\nof Year 2008 Death Reviews 31 (Dec. 2009) (hereinafter\n2008 Death Reviews). And the court dwelled on conditions\nat a facility that has since been replaced. See Juris. App.\n19a–20a, 24a, 89a–90a, 94a, 107a, 111a.\n   Prohibiting the State from introducing evidence about\nconditions as of the date when the prisoner release order\nwas under consideration, id., at 76a–78a, and n. 42, the\nthree-judge court explicitly stated that it would not “evalu\nate the state’s continuing constitutional violations.” Id., at\n——————\n   1 Before requesting the appointment of a three-judge court, the Dis\n\ntrict Court in Coleman recognized “commendable progress” in the\nState’s effort to provide adequate mental health care, Juris.

Instead, it based its remedy on constitutional defi\nciencies that, in its own words, were found “years ago.”\nIbid.2\n   The three-judge court justified its refusal to receive up\nto-date evidence on the ground that the State had not filed\na motion to terminate prospective relief under a provision\nof the PLRA, §3626(b). See Juris. App. 77a. Today’s\nopinion for this Court endorses that reasoning, ante, at 26.\nBut the State’s opportunity to file such a motion did not\neliminate the three-judge court’s obligation to ensure that\nits relief was necessary to remedy ongoing violations.3\nMoreover, the lower court’s reasoning did not properly\ntake into account the potential significance of the evidence\nthat the State sought to introduce. Even if that evidence\ndid not show that all violations had ceased—the showing\nneeded to obtain the termination of relief under\n§3626(b)—that evidence was highly relevant with respect\nto the nature and scope of permissible relief.4\n——————\n  2 For   this reason, it is simply not the case that “evidence of current\nconditions . . . informed every aspect of the judgment of the three-judge\ncourt,” as the majority insists, ante, at 25.\n   3 Because the Ninth Circuit places the burden on the State to prove\n\nthe absence of an ongoing violation when it moves to terminate pro\nspective relief, see Gilmore v. California, 220 F. 3d 987, 1007 (CA9\n2000), even if the State had unsuccessfully moved to terminate pro\nspective relief under 18 U. S. C. §3626(b), there would still have been no\ndetermination that plaintiffs had carried their burden under the PLRA\nto establish by clear and convincing evidence that a prisoner release\norder is necessary to correct an ongoing rights violation.\n   4 It is also no answer to say, as the Court now does, ante, at 26, that\n\nthe State had the opportunity to resist the convening of the three-judge\ncourt on the ground that there were no unremedied constitutional\nviolations as of that date. See §3626(a)(3)(A)(i). The District Courts\ngranted plaintiffs’ motions to convene a three-judge court in 2007, three\nyears before the remedial decree here was issued. Thus, the conditions\nin the prison system as of the date when the decree was issued were not\nnecessarily the same as those that existed before the three-judge court\nproceedings began.

As noted, however, the ex-\ntent of any continuing constitutional violations was highly\nrelevant to the question of remedy.\n   The majority also countenances the three-judge court’s\nreliance on dated findings. The majority notes that the\nlower court considered recent reports by the Special Mas\nter and Receiver, ante, at 18–19, but the majority provides\nno persuasive justification for the lower court’s refusal to\nreceive hard, up-to-date evidence about any continuing\nviolations. With the safety of the people of California in\nthe balance, the record on this issue should not have been\nclosed.\n   The majority repeats the lower court’s error of reciting\nstatistics that are clearly out of date. The Court notes\nthe lower court’s finding that as of 2005 “an inmate in one\nof California’s prisons needlessly dies every six to seven\ndays.” See ante, at 9. Yet by the date of the trial before\nthe three-judge court, the death rate had been trending\ndownward for 10 quarters, App. 2257, and the number of\nlikely preventable deaths fell from 18 in 2006 to 3 in 2007,\na decline of 83 percent.5 Between 2001 and 2007, the\n——————\ndecree, an accurate assessment of conditions as of that date was essen\ntial in order to ensure that the relief did not sweep more broadly than\nnecessary.\n   5 2008 Death Reviews 22.

But\nsuch anecdotal evidence cannot be given undue weight in\nassessing the current state of the California system. The\npopulation of the California prison system (156,000 in\nmates at the time of trial) is larger than that of many\nmedium-sized cities,7 and an examination of the medical\ncare provided to the residents of many such cities would\nlikely reveal cases in which grossly deficient treatment\nwas provided.

Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 419–420 (1977) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   Here, the majority and the court below maintain that no\nremedy short of a massive release of prisoners from the\ngeneral prison population can remedy the State’s failure to\nprovide constitutionally adequate health care. This argu\nment is implausible on its face and is not supported by the\nrequisite clear and convincing evidence.\n   It is instructive to consider the list of deficiencies in the\nCalifornia prison health care system that are highlighted\nin today’s opinion for this Court and in the opinion of the\ncourt below. The deficiencies noted by the majority here\ninclude the following: “ ‘[e]xam tables and counter tops,\nwhere prisoners with . . . communicable diseases are\ntreated, [are] not routinely disinfected,’ ” ante, at 10; medi\ncal facilities “ ‘are in an abysmal state of disrepair,’ ” ibid.;\nmedications “ ‘are too often not available when needed,’ ”\nante, at 10–11; “ ‘[b]asic medical equipment is often not\navailable or used,’ ” ante, at 10; prisons “would ‘hire any\ndoctor who had “a license, a pulse and a pair of shoes,” ’ ”\nibid.; and medical and mental health staff positions have\nhigh vacancy rates, ante, at 20. The three-judge court\npointed to similar problems. See Juris. App. 93a–121a\n(citing, among other things, staffing vacancies, too few\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Without\ntaking that radical and dangerous step, exam tables and\ncounter tops cannot properly be disinfected? None of the\nsystem’s dilapidated facilities can be repaired? Needed\nmedications and equipment cannot be purchased and\nused? Staff vacancies cannot be filled? The qualifica\ntions of prison physicians cannot be improved? A better\nrecords management system cannot be developed and\nimplemented?\n   I do not dispute that general overcrowding contributes to\nmany of the California system’s healthcare problems. But\nit by no means follows that reducing overcrowding is the\nonly or the best or even a particularly good way to allevi\nate those problems. Indeed, it is apparent that the pris\noner release ordered by the court below is poorly suited for\nthis purpose. The release order is not limited to prisoners\nneeding substantial medical care but instead calls for a\nreduction in the system’s overall population. Under the\norder issued by the court below, it is not necessary for\na single prisoner in the plaintiff classes to be released.\nAlthough some class members will presumably be among\nthose who are discharged, the decrease in the number of\nprisoners needing mental health treatment or other forms\nof extensive medical care will be much smaller than the\ntotal number of prisoners released, and thus the release\nwill produce at best only a modest improvement in the\nburden on the medical care system.\n   The record bears this out. The Special Master stated\ndramatically that even releasing 100,000 inmates (two\nthirds of the California system’s entire inmate popula\ntion!) would leave the problem of providing mental health\ntreatment “largely unmitigated.” App. 487. Similarly, the\nReceiver proclaimed that “ ‘those . . . who think that popu\n10                    BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlation controls will solve California’s prison health care\nproblems . . . are simply wrong.’ ” Juris. App. 282a.\n   The State proposed several remedies other than a mas\nsive release of prisoners, but the three-judge court, seem\ningly intent on attacking the broader problem of general\novercrowding, rejected all of the State’s proposals. In\ndoing so, the court made three critical errors.\n   First, the court did not assess those proposals and other\nremedies in light of conditions proved to exist at the time\nthe release order was framed. Had more recent evidence\nbeen taken into account, a less extreme remedy might\nhave been shown to be sufficient.\n   Second, the court failed to distinguish between condi\ntions that fall below the level that may be desirable as a\nmatter of public policy and conditions that do not meet the\nminimum level mandated by the Constitution. To take\none example, the court criticized the California system\nbecause prison doctors must conduct intake exams in\nareas separated by folding screens rather than in separate\nrooms, creating conditions that “do not allow for appropri\nate confidentiality.” Id., at 88a. But the legitimate pri\nvacy expectations of inmates are greatly diminished, see\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 525–526 (1984), and this\nCourt has never suggested that the failure to provide\nprivate consultation rooms in prisons amounts to cruel\nand unusual punishment.\n   Third, the court rejected alternatives that would not\nhave provided “ ‘immediate’ ” relief. Juris. App. 148a. But\nnothing in the PLRA suggests that public safety may be\nsacrificed in order to implement an immediate remedy\nrather than a less dangerous one that requires a more\nextended but reasonable period of time.\n   If the three-judge court had not made these errors, it is\nentirely possible that an adequate but less drastic reme\ndial plan could have been crafted. Without up-to-date\ninformation, it is not possible to specify what such a plan\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmight provide, and in any event, that is not a task that\nshould be undertaken in the first instance by this Court.\nBut possible components of such a plan are not hard to\nidentify.\n   Many of the problems noted above plainly could be\naddressed without releasing prisoners and without in\ncurring the costs associated with a large-scale prison\nconstruction program. Sanitary procedures could be im\nproved; sufficient supplies of medicine and medical\nequipment could be purchased; an adequate system of\nrecords management could be implemented; and the num\nber of medical and other staff positions could be increased.\nSimilarly, it is hard to believe that staffing vacancies\ncannot be reduced or eliminated and that the qualifica\ntions of medical personnel cannot be improved by any\nmeans short of a massive prisoner release. Without spe\ncific findings backed by hard evidence, this Court should\nnot accept the counterintuitive proposition that these\nproblems cannot be ameliorated by increasing salaries,\nimproving working conditions, and providing better train\ning and monitoring of performance.\n   While the cost of a large-scale construction program\nmay well exceed California’s current financial capabilities,\na more targeted program, involving the repair and per\nhaps the expansion of current medical facilities (as op\nposed to general prison facilities), might be manageable.\nAfter all, any remedy in this case, including the new pro\ngrams associated with the prisoner release order and\nother proposed relief now before the three-judge court, will\nnecessarily involve some state expenditures.\n   Measures such as these might be combined with tar\ngeted reductions in critical components of the State’s\nprison population. A certain number of prisoners in the\nclasses on whose behalf the two cases were brought might\nbe transferred to out-of-state facilities. The three-judge\ncourt rejected the State’s proposal to transfer prisoners to\n12                          BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nout-of-state facilities in part because the number of pro\nposed transfers was too small. See id., at 160a. See also\nante, at 30. But this reasoning rested on the court’s insis\ntence on a reduction in the State’s general prison popula\ntion rather than the two plaintiff classes.\n    When the State proposed to make a targeted transfer of\nprisoners in one of the plaintiff classes (i.e., prisoners\nneeding mental health treatment), one of the District\nJudges blocked the transfers for fear that the out-of-state\nfacilities would not provide a sufficiently high level of care.\nSee App. 434–440. The District Judge even refused to\nallow out-of-state transfers for prisoners who volunteered\nfor relocation. See id., at 437. And the court did this even\nthough there was not even an allegation, let alone clear\nevidence, that the States to which these prisoners would\nhave been sent were violating the Eighth Amendment.\n    The District Judge presumed that the receiving States\nmight fail to provide constitutionally adequate care, but\n“ ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts\npresume that [public officers] have properly discharged\ntheir official duties.’ ” United States v. Armstrong, 517\nU. S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting United States v. Chemical\nFoundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14–15 (1926)); Postal Service\nv. Gregory, 534 U.

But the PLRA does not apply when the State\nvoluntarily conducts such transfers, as it has sought to do.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. 2915:12–15 (Feb. 3, 2009). The three-judge\ncourt rejected this proposal, and its response exemplified\nwhat went wrong in this case. One judge complained that\nthis remedy would be deficient because it would protect\nonly the members of the plaintiff classes. The judge\nstated:\n    “The only thing is we would be protecting the class\n    members. And maybe that’s the appropriate thing to\n    do. I mean, that’s what this case is about, but it\n    would be . . . difficult for me to say yes, and the hell\n    with everybody else.” Id., at 2915:23–2916:2.\nOverstepping his authority, the judge was not content to\nprovide relief for the classes of plaintiffs on whose behalf\nthe suit before him was brought. Nor was he content to\nremedy the only constitutional violations that were\nproved—which concerned the treatment of the members of\nthose classes. Instead, the judge saw it as his responsibil\nity to attack the general problem of overcrowding.\n                             III\n  Before ordering any prisoner release, the PLRA com\nmands a court to “give substantial weight to any adverse\nimpact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system caused by the relief.” §3626(a)(1)(A). This\nprovision unmistakably reflects Congress’ view that pris\noner release orders are inherently risky.\n  In taking this view, Congress was well aware of the\nimpact of previous prisoner release orders. The prisoner\nrelease program carried out a few years earlier in Phila\ndelphia is illustrative. In the early 1990’s, federal courts\nenforced a cap on the number of inmates in the Philadel\nphia prison system, and thousands of inmates were set\n14                         BROWN v. PLATA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfree. Although efforts were made to release only those\nprisoners who were least likely to commit violent crimes,\nthat attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful. During an\n18-month period, the Philadelphia police rearrested thou\nsands of these prisoners for committing 9,732 new crimes.\nThose defendants were charged with 79 murders, 90\nrapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 robberies, 701 burglaries, and\n2,748 thefts, not to mention thousands of drug offenses.9\nMembers of Congress were well aware of this experience.10\n  Despite the record of past prisoner release orders, the\nthree-judge court in this case concluded that loosing\n46,000 criminals would not produce a tally like that in\nPhiladelphia and would actually improve public safety.\nJuris. App. 248a–249a. In reaching this debatable con\nclusion, the three-judge court relied on the testimony of\nselected experts, id., at 248a, and the majority now defers\nto what it characterizes as the lower court’s findings of\nfact on this controversial public policy issue, ante, at 15,\n19–20, 24.\n  This is a fundamental and dangerous error.

According to that court, “overwhelming\nevidence” supported this purported finding. Id., at 232a.\nBut a more cautious court, less bent on implementing its\nown criminal justice agenda, would have at least acknowl\nedged that the consequences of this massive prisoner\nrelease cannot be ascertained in advance with any degree\nof certainty and that it is entirely possible that this re\nlease will produce results similar to those under prior\ncourt-ordered population caps. After all, the sharp in\ncrease in the California prison population that the three\njudge court lamented, see id., at 254a, has been accompa\nnied by an equally sharp decrease in violent crime.11\nThese California trends mirror similar developments at\nthe national level,12 and “[t]here is a general consensus\nthat the decline in crime is, at least in part, due to more\nand longer prison sentences.”13 If increased incarceration\n——————\n  11 From 1992 to 2009, the violent crime rate in California per 100,000\n\nresidents fell from 1,119.7 to 472.0—a decrease of 57.8 percent.

But testimony pointing out the diffi\nculty of assessing the consequences of this drastic remedy\nwould have been valued by a careful court duly mindful of\nthe overriding need to guard public safety.\n   The three-judge court acknowledged that it “ha[d] not\nevaluated the public safety impact of each individual\nelement” of the population reduction plan it ordered the\nState to implement.
