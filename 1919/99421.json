St. &#167;&#167; 9933-9938), as amended by Act Aug. 18, 1894, c. 299, &#167; 3, 28 Stat. 360 (Comp. St. &#167; 9935), and Act May 28, 1908, c. 212, &#167; 8, 35 Stat. 426 (Comp. St. &#167; 9935), for illegal dumping in New York Harbor. Appellant, as claimant of the scow, denied the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit: First, on the ground that by the statute the vessel was made liable only for such penalties as might be imposed in criminal proceedings upon the persons responsible for the illegal act, and there had been in this case no conviction of such persons or assessment of penalties; and, secondly, that the assessment of such penalties was not within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction of the court. A motion to dismiss on this ground was overruled, the court gave judgment against the scow (247 Fed. 348), and the claimant appeals to this court upon the jurisdictional question under section 238, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp.

In support of this The Strathairly, 124 U. S. 558, 8 Sup. Ct. 609, 31 L. Ed. 580, is cited. That was a suit brought under sections 4252, 4253, 4255, 4266, and 4270, Rev. St., which contained provisions respecting the carriage of passengers on vessels entering or leaving ports of the United States, and prescribed fines and penalties against the master and owner of the vessel violating such provisions.

This precludes the idea that the proceeding by libel is to be deferred to await the possibly slow course of criminal proceedings against the persons individually responsible. It treats the offending vessel as a guilty thing, upon the familiar principle of the maritime law, and permits a proceeding against her in any court of admiralty 'having jurisdiction thereof'&#8212;meaning any court within whose jurisdiction she may be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Libels of this character, without previous conviction of the responsible persons, have been entertained under this act from the time of its enactment, and dealt with upon the merits, without question as to the jurisdiction until now.
