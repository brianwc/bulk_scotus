By formal written instruments dated July 15, 1910, he assigned both policies to his wife 'if she outlives me, otherwise to may estate, with full power to the insured to change the beneficiary or surrender this policy to said company at any time, this to be done by instrument in writing under his hand and seal to be recorded at the home office of the company.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While both policies were in the bankrupt's possession, the trustee demanded them in order that their cash surrender value might be secured and distributed under Bankruptcy Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544 (Comp. St. &#167;&#167; 9585-9656). The bankrupt defended upon two grounds: First, that the cash surrender value was not property which could have been transferred by him prior to bankruptcy; and, second, that the assignment to his wife could not be defeated by the trustee because protected by section 2498, Georgia Code 1910, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The assured may direct the money to be paid to his personal      representative, or to his widow, or to his children, or to      his assignee; and upon such direction given, and assented to      by the insurer, no other person can defeat the same.

The provision does not purport to make every such      direction by the assured irrevocable by him, or to invalidate      a stipulation in a life policy giving the assured the right      to change the beneficiary at any time during the continuance      of the policy. The statute puts a direction by the assured to      pay to his widow on the same footing as one to pay to his      assignee.
