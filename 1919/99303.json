The case comes here upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. From the certificate it appears that Webb and Goldbaum were convicted and sentenced in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee on a charge of conspiracy (section 37, Penal Code [Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1096; Comp. St. &#167; 10201]) to violate the Harrison Narcotic Law.

It was Webb's regular cus tom and practice to prescribe morphine for habitual users, upon      their application to him therefor. He furnished these      'prescriptions,' not after consideration of the applicant's      individual case, and in such quantities and with such      direction as, in his judgment, would tend to cure the habit,      or as might be necessary or helpful in an attempt to break      the habit, but with such consideration and rather in such      quantities as the applicant desired for the sake of      continuing his accustomed use. Goldbaum was familiar with      such practice and habitually filled such prescriptions. Webb      had duly registered and paid the special tax as required by      section 1 of the act. Goldbaum had also registered and paid      such tax and kept all records required by the law. Goldbaum      had been provided with the blank forms contemplated by      section 2 of the act for use in ordering morphine, and, by      the use of such blank order forms, had obtained from the      wholesalers, in Memphis, a stock of morphine. It had been      agreed and understood between Webb and Goldbaum that Goldbaum      should, by using such order forms, procure a stock of      morphine, which morphine he should and would sell to those      who desired to purchase and who came provided with Webb's      so-called prescriptions. It was the intent of Webb and      Goldbaum that morphine should thus be furnished to the      habitual users thereof by Goldbaum and without any      physician's prescription issued in the course of a good faith      attempt to cure the morphine habit. In order that these facts      may have their true color, it should also be stated that      within a period of eleven months Goldbaum purchased from      wholesalers, in Memphis, thirty times as much morphine as was      bought by the average retail druggist doing a larger general      business, and he sold narcotic drugs in 6,500 instances; that      Webb regularly charged fifty cents for each so-called      prescription, and within this period had furnished, and      Goldbaum had filled, over four thousand such prescriptions;      and that one Rabens, a user of the drug, came from another state and applied to Webb for      morphine and was given at one time ten so-called      prescriptions for one drachm each, which prescriptions were      filled at one time by Goldbaum upon Rabens' presentation,      although each was made out in a separate and fictitious      name.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon these facts the Circuit Court of Appeals propounds to this court three questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.
