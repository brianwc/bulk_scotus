In 1970, after trial, the District Court, holding that the defendants had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, ordered them to submit a plan for desegregation which would provide that beginning with the 1970-1971 school year there would be no school \"with a majority of any minority students.\"  The defendants complied.  In 1974, however, applicants, successors in office to the previous defendants, filed a motion with the District Court seeking to modify the 1970 order by eliminating the \"no majority\" requirement.  The District Court denied the motion, ruling that the \"no majority\" requirement was an inflexible one to be applied anew each school year even though subsequent changes in the racial mix in the schools were caused by factors for which the defendants might not be considered responsible.  The Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling, but we reversed, concluding that the District Court had exceeded its authority in enforcing the \"no majority\" provision so as to require annual readjustment of attendance zones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon remand to the District Court, a hearing was scheduled on applicants' motion for dissolution of the 1970 injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Applicants represented that there was no plan at that time to make any changes in the method of making student assignments.  Shortly thereafter, on July 1, 1977, the District Court deleted the \"no majority\" provision from the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The hearing was completed and the matter submitted to the District Court for resolution.  By late January 1978, when no further action had been taken by the District Court, however, applicants withdrew their representation that no changes would be made in the method of student assignments and on February 28, 1978, the District Court entered the following oral order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" . . .  pending decision of this Court on the submitted      matters before the Court or until further order of the Court,      that each of you are enjoined from making any changes in the      method of student assignments in the Pasadena Unified School      District that was in effect on October 21, 1977.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicants, concerned that the District Court did not include in the order anything expressly relating to the \"no majority\" provision, sought a clarification of the order later that same day.  Applicants' counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have concluded from that omission, you  Honor, that      the purport of the order which was issued or the injunction      which was issued this morning to those defendants was that      they are indeed enjoined to take measures for the purpose of      insuring that no school in the district has a majority of any      minority students.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judge replied:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"That is right, Mr. McDonough.

See <i>Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp.,</i> 434 U.S. 425, 98 S.Ct. 702, 54 L.Ed.2d 659 (1978).  But I do not think the judge's statements during the colloquy can be read as having that effect, and I accordingly deny the application for a stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court took steps which unequivocally lifted the offending part of the 1970 order.  See n. 3.  That was done on July 1, 1977.  And there is nothing in the record before me to indicate that after that date the \"no majority\" requirement was part of the method of student assignments.  On February 28 the District Court ordered applicants to refrain from making any changes in the method of student assignments in effect as of October 21, 1977, a date well after the July 1 date on which the \"no majority\" requirement was eliminated from the 1970 injunction. On its face this order certainly cannot be read as reimposing the \"no majority\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even as a matter of language, one would have to strain to read the colloquy occurring later that same day as indicating that the judge thought his order had reimposed the \"no majority\" provision.  Busy judges and busy lawyers do not invariably speak with mathematical precision in such a colloquy.  The obligations imposed by an injunction must be clear and well-defined.  A judge should not be thought, by a cryptic and off-handed remark in a later proceeding, to have reimposed an obligation which he specifically and unequivocally eliminated just a few months before pursuant to the direction of this Court and to which he made absolutely no reference in the original order.  I will not indulge the presumption that the District Court acted contrary to these well settled principles in the absence of a clear indication that it in fact did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the District Court's order of February 28 does not conflict with our decision in <i>Spangler, supra,</i> by placing applicants under any obligation to annually reassign students so that there is no school \"with a majority of any minority students,\" I do not think five Members of this Court will vote to grant a writ of mandamus.  Thus, I see no reason to issue the requested stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if at some future time the District Court actually reimposes the \"no majority\" requirement in contravention of our decision in <i>Spangler, supra,</i> or otherwise requires applicants to comply with such a provision, applicants may again petition this Court or the Court of Appeals for relief.  At this time such relief appears unwarranted, however, because applicants do not appear to be under any such obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Three separate orders are actually involved, but all are substantially identical.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The cause was initially remanded to the Court of Appeals which in turn merely remanded it to the District Court, noting that \"all determinations as to modifications required under [<i>Spangler, SUPRA</i> ]  . . .
