CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,\r\n\r\n        FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT, DIVISION ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n      No. 13–132.      Argued April 29, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014*\r\nIn No. 13–132, petitioner Riley was stopped for a traffic violation,\r\n  which eventually led to his arrest on weapons charges. An officer\r\n  searching Riley incident to the arrest seized a cell phone from Riley’s\r\n  pants pocket. The officer accessed information on the phone and no-\r\n  ticed the repeated use of a term associated with a street gang. At the\r\n  police station two hours later, a detective specializing in gangs fur-\r\n  ther examined the phone’s digital contents. Based in part on photo-\r\n  graphs and videos that the detective found, the State charged Riley\r\n  in connection with a shooting that had occurred a few weeks earlier\r\n  and sought an enhanced sentence based on Riley’s gang membership.\r\n  Riley moved to suppress all evidence that the police had obtained\r\n  from his cell phone. The trial court denied the motion, and Riley was\r\n  convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed.\r\n     In No. 13–212, respondent Wurie was arrested after police ob-\r\n  served him participate in an apparent drug sale. At the police sta-\r\n  tion, the officers seized a cell phone from Wurie’s person and noticed\r\n  that the phone was receiving multiple calls from a source identified\r\n  as “my house” on its external screen. The officers opened the phone,\r\n  accessed its call log, determined the number associated with the “my\r\n  house” label, and traced that number to what they suspected was\r\n  Wurie’s apartment. They secured a search warrant and found drugs,\r\n  a firearm and ammunition, and cash in the ensuing search. Wurie\r\n  was then charged with drug and firearm offenses. He moved to sup-\r\n  press the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment. The\r\n  District Court denied the motion, and Wurie was convicted. The\r\n——————\r\n  * Together with No. 13–212, United States v. Wurie, on certiorari to\r\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\r\n2                        RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    First Circuit reversed the denial of the motion to suppress and vacat-\r\n    ed the relevant convictions.\r\nHeld: The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital\r\n information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been\r\n arrested. Pp. 5–28.\r\n    (a) A warrantless search is reasonable only if it falls within a spe-\r\n cific exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. See\r\n Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The well-established exception\r\n at issue here applies when a warrantless search is conducted incident\r\n to a lawful arrest.\r\n    Three related precedents govern the extent to which officers may\r\n search property found on or near an arrestee. Chimel v. California,\r\n 395 U. S. 752, requires that a search incident to arrest be limited to\r\n the area within the arrestee’s immediate control, where it is justified\r\n by the interests in officer safety and in preventing evidence destruc-\r\n tion. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, the Court applied\r\n the Chimel analysis to a search of a cigarette pack found on the ar-\r\n restee’s person. It held that the risks identified in Chimel are pre-\r\n sent in all custodial arrests, 414 U. S., at 235, even when there is no\r\n specific concern about the loss of evidence or the threat to officers in a\r\n particular case, id., at 236. The trilogy concludes with Arizona v.\r\n Gant, 556 U. S. 332, which permits searches of a car where the ar-\r\n restee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger\r\n compartment, or where it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the\r\n crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle, id., at 343. Pp. 5–8.\r\n    (b) The Court declines to extend Robinson’s categorical rule to\r\n searches of data stored on cell phones. Absent more precise guidance\r\n from the founding era, the Court generally determines whether to ex-\r\n empt a given type of search from the warrant requirement “by as-\r\n sessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an in-\r\n dividual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed\r\n for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Wyoming v.\r\n Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300. That balance of interests supported\r\n the search incident to arrest exception in Robinson. But a search of\r\n digital information on a cell phone does not further the government\r\n interests identified in Chimel, and implicates substantially greater\r\n individual privacy interests than a brief physical search. Pp. 8–22.\r\n      (1) The digital data stored on cell phones does not present either\r\n Chimel risk. Pp. 10–15.\r\n         (i) Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a\r\n weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the arrestee’s es-\r\n cape. Officers may examine the phone’s physical aspects to ensure\r\n that it will not be used as a weapon, but the data on the phone can\r\n endanger no one. To the extent that a search of cell phone data\r\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nmight warn officers of an impending danger, e.g., that the arrestee’s\r\nconfederates are headed to the scene, such a concern is better ad-\r\ndressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the war-\r\nrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden,\r\nMd. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299. Pp. 10–12.\r\n       (ii) The United States and California raise concerns about the\r\ndestruction of evidence, arguing that, even if the cell phone is physi-\r\ncally secure, information on the cell phone remains vulnerable to re-\r\nmote wiping and data encryption. As an initial matter, those broad\r\nconcerns are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a defendant who re-\r\nsponds to arrest by trying to conceal or destroy evidence within his\r\nreach. The briefing also gives little indication that either problem is\r\nprevalent or that the opportunity to perform a search incident to ar-\r\nrest would be an effective solution. And, at least as to remote wiping,\r\nlaw enforcement currently has some technologies of its own for com-\r\nbatting the loss of evidence. Finally, law enforcement’s remaining\r\nconcerns in a particular case might be addressed by responding in a\r\ntargeted manner to urgent threats of remote wiping, see Missouri v.\r\nMcNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___, or by taking action to disable a phone’s\r\nlocking mechanism in order to secure the scene, see Illinois v. McAr-\r\nthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333. Pp. 12–15.\r\n     (2) A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee’s\r\npockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond\r\nthe arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but\r\nmore substantial privacy interests are at stake when digital data is\r\ninvolved. Pp. 15–22.\r\n       (i) Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative\r\nsense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee’s per-\r\nson. Notably, modern cell phones have an immense storage capacity.\r\nBefore cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical reali-\r\nties and generally constituted only a narrow intrusion on privacy.\r\nBut cell phones can store millions of pages of text, thousands of pic-\r\ntures, or hundreds of videos. This has several interrelated privacy\r\nconsequences. First, a cell phone collects in one place many distinct\r\ntypes of information that reveal much more in combination than any\r\nisolated record. Second, the phone’s capacity allows even just one\r\ntype of information to convey far more than previously possible.\r\nThird, data on the phone can date back for years. In addition, an el-\r\nement of pervasiveness characterizes cell phones but not physical\r\nrecords. A decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled\r\nacross a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the\r\nmore than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their\r\nperson a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives. Pp. 17–\r\n21.\r\n4                         RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n            (ii) The scope of the privacy interests at stake is further com-\r\n    plicated by the fact that the data viewed on many modern cell phones\r\n    may in fact be stored on a remote server. Thus, a search may extend\r\n    well beyond papers and effects in the physical proximity of an ar-\r\n    restee, a concern that the United States recognizes but cannot defini-\r\n    tively foreclose. Pp. 21–22.\r\n       (c) Fallback options offered by the United States and California are\r\n    flawed and contravene this Court’s general preference to provide\r\n    clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules. See\r\n    Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19. One possible rule is\r\n    to import the Gant standard from the vehicle context and allow a\r\n    warrantless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is reason-\r\n    able to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of ar-\r\n    rest. That proposal is not appropriate in this context, and would\r\n    prove no practical limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches.\r\n    Another possible rule is to restrict the scope of a cell phone search to\r\n    information relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or officer\r\n    safety. That proposal would again impose few meaningful con-\r\n    straints on officers. Finally, California suggests an analogue rule,\r\n    under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have\r\n    obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. That\r\n    proposal would allow law enforcement to search a broad range of\r\n    items contained on a phone even though people would be unlikely to\r\n    carry such a variety of information in physical form, and would\r\n    launch courts on a difficult line-drawing expedition to determine\r\n    which digital files are comparable to physical records. Pp. 22–25.\r\n       (d) It is true that this decision will have some impact on the ability\r\n    of law enforcement to combat crime. But the Court’s holding is not\r\n    that the information on a cell phone is immune from search; it is that\r\n    a warrant is generally required before a search. The warrant re-\r\n    quirement is an important component of the Court’s Fourth Amend-\r\n    ment jurisprudence, and warrants may be obtained with increasing\r\n    efficiency. In addition, although the search incident to arrest excep-\r\n    tion does not apply to cell phones, the continued availability of the ex-\r\n    igent circumstances exception may give law enforcement a justifica-\r\n    tion for a warrantless search in particular cases.

In\r\nthe course of the stop, the officer also learned that Riley’s\r\nlicense had been suspended. The officer impounded Ri-\r\nley’s car, pursuant to department policy, and another\r\n2                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nofficer conducted an inventory search of the car. Riley was\r\narrested for possession of concealed and loaded firearms\r\nwhen that search turned up two handguns under the car’s\r\nhood. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§12025(a)(1), 12031(a)(1)\r\n(West 2009).\r\n   An officer searched Riley incident to the arrest and\r\nfound items associated with the “Bloods” street gang. He\r\nalso seized a cell phone from Riley’s pants pocket. Accord-\r\ning to Riley’s uncontradicted assertion, the phone was a\r\n“smart phone,” a cell phone with a broad range of other\r\nfunctions based on advanced computing capability, large\r\nstorage capacity, and Internet connectivity. The officer\r\naccessed information on the phone and noticed that some\r\nwords (presumably in text messages or a contacts list)\r\nwere preceded by the letters “CK”—a label that, he be-\r\nlieved, stood for “Crip Killers,” a slang term for members\r\nof the Bloods gang.\r\n   At the police station about two hours after the arrest, a\r\ndetective specializing in gangs further examined the con-\r\ntents of the phone. The detective testified that he “went\r\nthrough” Riley’s phone “looking for evidence, because . . .\r\ngang members will often video themselves with guns or\r\ntake pictures of themselves with the guns.” App. in No.\r\n13–132, p. 20. Although there was “a lot of stuff ” on the\r\nphone, particular files that “caught [the detective’s] eye”\r\nincluded videos of young men sparring while someone\r\nyelled encouragement using the moniker “Blood.” Id., at\r\n11–13. The police also found photographs of Riley stand-\r\ning in front of a car they suspected had been involved in a\r\nshooting a few weeks earlier.\r\n   Riley was ultimately charged, in connection with that\r\nearlier shooting, with firing at an occupied vehicle, assault\r\nwith a semiautomatic firearm, and attempted murder.\r\nThe State alleged that Riley had committed those crimes\r\nfor the benefit of a criminal street gang, an aggravating\r\nfactor that carries an enhanced sentence.

He contended\r\nthat the searches of his phone violated the Fourth\r\nAmendment, because they had been performed without a\r\nwarrant and were not otherwise justified by exigent cir-\r\ncumstances. The trial court rejected that argument. App.\r\nin No. 13–132, at 24, 26. At Riley’s trial, police officers\r\ntestified about the photographs and videos found on the\r\nphone, and some of the photographs were admitted into\r\nevidence.

See id., at\r\n93, 244 P. 3d, at 505–506.\r\n  The California Supreme Court denied Riley’s petition for\r\nreview, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13–132, at 24a, and we\r\ngranted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\r\n                             B\r\n  In the second case, a police officer performing routine\r\nsurveillance observed respondent Brima Wurie make an\r\napparent drug sale from a car. Officers subsequently\r\narrested Wurie and took him to the police station. At the\r\nstation, the officers seized two cell phones from Wurie’s\r\nperson. The one at issue here was a “flip phone,” a kind of\r\nphone that is flipped open for use and that generally has a\r\nsmaller range of features than a smart phone. Five to ten\r\nminutes after arriving at the station, the officers noticed\r\nthat the phone was repeatedly receiving calls from a\r\n4                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsource identified as “my house” on the phone’s external\r\nscreen. A few minutes later, they opened the phone and\r\nsaw a photograph of a woman and a baby set as the\r\nphone’s wallpaper. They pressed one button on the phone\r\nto access its call log, then another button to determine the\r\nphone number associated with the “my house” label. They\r\nnext used an online phone directory to trace that phone\r\nnumber to an apartment building.\r\n   When the officers went to the building, they saw Wurie’s\r\nname on a mailbox and observed through a window a\r\nwoman who resembled the woman in the photograph on\r\nWurie’s phone. They secured the apartment while obtain-\r\ning a search warrant and, upon later executing the war-\r\nrant, found and seized 215 grams of crack cocaine, mari-\r\njuana, drug paraphernalia, a firearm and ammunition, and\r\ncash.\r\n   Wurie was charged with distributing crack cocaine,\r\npossessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and\r\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\r\nSee 18 U. S. C. §922(g); 21 U. S. C. §841(a). He moved to\r\nsuppress the evidence obtained from the search of the\r\napartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an unconstitu-\r\ntional search of his cell phone. The District Court denied\r\nthe motion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2009). Wurie was\r\nconvicted on all three counts and sentenced to 262 months\r\nin prison.\r\n   A divided panel of the First Circuit reversed the denial\r\nof Wurie’s motion to suppress and vacated Wurie’s convic-\r\ntions for possession with intent to distribute and posses-\r\nsion of a firearm as a felon. 728 F. 3d 1 (2013). The court\r\nheld that cell phones are distinct from other physical\r\npossessions that may be searched incident to arrest with-\r\nout a warrant, because of the amount of personal data cell\r\nphones contain and the negligible threat they pose to law\r\nenforcement interests.

S. 398, 403 (2006). Our cases have deter-\r\nmined that “[w]here a search is undertaken by law en-\r\nforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrong-\r\ndoing, . . . reasonableness generally requires the obtaining\r\nof a judicial warrant.” Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,\r\n515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995). Such a warrant ensures that\r\nthe inferences to support a search are “drawn by a neutral\r\nand detached magistrate instead of being judged by the\r\nofficer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of\r\nferreting out crime.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.\r\n10, 14 (1948). In the absence of a warrant, a search is\r\nreasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the\r\nwarrant requirement. See Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.\r\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6).\r\n   The two cases before us concern the reasonableness of a\r\nwarrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In 1914,\r\nthis Court first acknowledged in dictum “the right on the\r\npart of the Government, always recognized under English\r\nand American law, to search the person of the accused\r\nwhen legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or\r\nevidences of crime.” Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383,\r\n392. Since that time, it has been well accepted that such a\r\nsearch constitutes an exception to the warrant require-\r\nment. Indeed, the label “exception” is something of a\r\n6                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmisnomer in this context, as warrantless searches incident\r\nto arrest occur with far greater frequency than searches\r\nconducted pursuant to a warrant. See 3 W. LaFave,\r\nSearch and Seizure §5.2(b), p. 132, and n. 15 (5th ed.\r\n2012).\r\n  Although the existence of the exception for such searches\r\nhas been recognized for a century, its scope has been de-\r\nbated for nearly as long. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S.\r\n332, 350 (2009) (noting the exception’s “checkered his-\r\ntory”). That debate has focused on the extent to which\r\nofficers may search property found on or near the arrestee.\r\nThree related precedents set forth the rules governing\r\nsuch searches:\r\n  The first, Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), laid\r\nthe groundwork for most of the existing search incident to\r\narrest doctrine. Police officers in that case arrested\r\nChimel inside his home and proceeded to search his entire\r\nthree-bedroom house, including the attic and garage. In\r\nparticular rooms, they also looked through the contents of\r\ndrawers. Id., at 753–754.\r\n   The Court crafted the following rule for assessing the\r\nreasonableness of a search incident to arrest:\r\n    “When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the ar-\r\n    resting officer to search the person arrested in order\r\n    to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to\r\n    use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Oth-\r\n    erwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered,\r\n    and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is en-\r\n    tirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for\r\n    and seize any evidence on the arrestee’s person in or-\r\n    der to prevent its concealment or destruction. . . .\r\n    There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of\r\n    the arrestee’s person and the area ‘within his immedi-\r\n    ate control’—construing that phrase to mean the area\r\n    from within which he might gain possession of a\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    weapon or destructible evidence.” Id., at 762–763.\r\nThe extensive warrantless search of Chimel’s home did not\r\nfit within this exception, because it was not needed to\r\nprotect officer safety or to preserve evidence. Id., at 763,\r\n768.\r\n   Four years later, in United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S.\r\n218 (1973), the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the\r\ncontext of a search of the arrestee’s person. A police of-\r\nficer had arrested Robinson for driving with a revoked\r\nlicense. The officer conducted a patdown search and felt\r\nan object that he could not identify in Robinson’s coat\r\npocket. He removed the object, which turned out to be a\r\ncrumpled cigarette package, and opened it. Inside were 14\r\ncapsules of heroin. Id., at 220, 223.\r\n   The Court of Appeals concluded that the search was\r\nunreasonable because Robinson was unlikely to have\r\nevidence of the crime of arrest on his person, and because\r\nit believed that extracting the cigarette package and open-\r\ning it could not be justified as part of a protective search\r\nfor weapons. This Court reversed, rejecting the notion\r\nthat “case-by-case adjudication” was required to determine\r\n“whether or not there was present one of the reasons\r\nsupporting the authority for a search of the person inci-\r\ndent to a lawful arrest.” Id., at 235. As the Court ex-\r\nplained, “[t]he authority to search the person incident to a\r\nlawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to\r\ndisarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what\r\na court may later decide was the probability in a particu-\r\nlar arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact\r\nbe found upon the person of the suspect.” Ibid. Instead, a\r\n“custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a\r\nreasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that\r\nintrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest\r\nrequires no additional justification.” Ibid.\r\n   The Court thus concluded that the search of Robinson\r\n8                    RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwas reasonable even though there was no concern about\r\nthe loss of evidence, and the arresting officer had no spe-\r\ncific concern that Robinson might be armed. Id., at 236.\r\nIn doing so, the Court did not draw a line between a\r\nsearch of Robinson’s person and a further examination of\r\nthe cigarette pack found during that search. It merely\r\nnoted that, “[h]aving in the course of a lawful search come\r\nupon the crumpled package of cigarettes, [the officer] was\r\nentitled to inspect it.” Ibid. A few years later, the Court\r\nclarified that this exception was limited to “personal prop-\r\nerty . . . immediately associated with the person of the\r\narrestee.” United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 15\r\n(1977) (200-pound, locked footlocker could not be searched\r\nincident to arrest), abrogated on other grounds by Califor-\r\nnia v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565 (1991).\r\n   The search incident to arrest trilogy concludes with\r\nGant, which analyzed searches of an arrestee’s vehicle.\r\nGant, like Robinson, recognized that the Chimel concerns\r\nfor officer safety and evidence preservation underlie the\r\nsearch incident to arrest exception. See 556 U. S., at 338.\r\nAs a result, the Court concluded that Chimel could author-\r\nize police to search a vehicle “only when the arrestee is\r\nunsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger\r\ncompartment at the time of the search.” 556 U. S., at 343.\r\nGant added, however, an independent exception for a\r\nwarrantless search of a vehicle’s passenger compartment\r\n“when it is ‘reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the\r\ncrime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.’ ” Ibid.\r\n(quoting Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632\r\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). That excep-\r\ntion stems not from Chimel, the Court explained, but from\r\n“circumstances unique to the vehicle context.” 556 U. S.,\r\nat 343.\r\n                              III\r\n    These cases require us to decide how the search incident\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto arrest doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are\r\nnow such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that\r\nthe proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were\r\nan important feature of human anatomy. A smart phone\r\nof the sort taken from Riley was unheard of ten years ago;\r\na significant majority of American adults now own such\r\nphones. See A. Smith, Pew Research Center, Smartphone\r\nOwnership—2013 Update (June 5, 2013). Even less so-\r\nphisticated phones like Wurie’s, which have already faded\r\nin popularity since Wurie was arrested in 2007, have been\r\naround for less than 15 years. Both phones are based on\r\ntechnology nearly inconceivable just a few decades ago,\r\nwhen Chimel and Robinson were decided.\r\n   Absent more precise guidance from the founding era, we\r\ngenerally determine whether to exempt a given type of\r\nsearch from the warrant requirement “by assessing, on the\r\none hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individ-\r\nual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is\r\nneeded for the promotion of legitimate governmental\r\ninterests.” Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300\r\n(1999). Such a balancing of interests supported the search\r\nincident to arrest exception in Robinson, and a mechanical\r\napplication of Robinson might well support the warrant-\r\nless searches at issue here.\r\n   But while Robinson’s categorical rule strikes the appro-\r\npriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of\r\nits rationales has much force with respect to digital con-\r\ntent on cell phones. On the government interest side,\r\nRobinson concluded that the two risks identified in\r\nChimel—harm to officers and destruction of evidence—are\r\npresent in all custodial arrests. There are no comparable\r\nrisks when the search is of digital data. In addition, Rob-\r\ninson regarded any privacy interests retained by an indi-\r\nvidual after arrest as significantly diminished by the fact\r\nof the arrest itself. Cell phones, however, place vast quan-\r\ntities of personal information literally in the hands of\r\n10                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nindividuals. A search of the information on a cell phone\r\nbears little resemblance to the type of brief physical search\r\nconsidered in Robinson.\r\n  We therefore decline to extend Robinson to searches of\r\ndata on cell phones, and hold instead that officers must\r\ngenerally secure a warrant before conducting such a\r\nsearch.\r\n                               A\r\n   We first consider each Chimel concern in turn. In doing\r\nso, we do not overlook Robinson’s admonition that searches\r\nof a person incident to arrest, “while based upon the\r\nneed to disarm and to discover evidence,” are reasonable\r\nregardless of “the probability in a particular arrest situa-\r\ntion that weapons or evidence would in fact be found.” 414\r\nU. S., at 235. Rather than requiring the “case-by-case\r\nadjudication” that Robinson rejected, ibid., we ask instead\r\nwhether application of the search incident to arrest doc-\r\ntrine to this particular category of effects would “untether\r\nthe rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel\r\nexception,” Gant, supra, at 343. See also Knowles v. Iowa,\r\n525 U. S. 113, 119 (1998) (declining to extend Robinson to\r\nthe issuance of citations, “a situation where the concern\r\nfor officer safety is not present to the same extent and the\r\nconcern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at\r\nall”).\r\n                              1\r\n   Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used\r\nas a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate\r\nthe arrestee’s escape. Law enforcement officers remain\r\nfree to examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure\r\nthat it will not be used as a weapon—say, to determine\r\nwhether there is a razor blade hidden between the phone\r\nand its case. Once an officer has secured a phone and\r\neliminated any potential physical threats, however, data\r\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\non the phone can endanger no one.\r\n   Perhaps the same might have been said of the cigarette\r\npack seized from Robinson’s pocket. Once an officer\r\ngained control of the pack, it was unlikely that Robinson\r\ncould have accessed the pack’s contents. But unknown\r\nphysical objects may always pose risks, no matter how\r\nslight, during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest.\r\nThe officer in Robinson testified that he could not identify\r\nthe objects in the cigarette pack but knew they were not\r\ncigarettes. See 414 U. S., at 223, 236, n. 7. Given that, a\r\nfurther search was a reasonable protective measure. No\r\nsuch unknowns exist with respect to digital data. As the\r\nFirst Circuit explained, the officers who searched Wurie’s\r\ncell phone “knew exactly what they would find therein:\r\ndata. They also knew that the data could not harm them.”\r\n728 F. 3d, at 10.\r\n   The United States and California both suggest that a\r\nsearch of cell phone data might help ensure officer safety\r\nin more indirect ways, for example by alerting officers that\r\nconfederates of the arrestee are headed to the scene.\r\nThere is undoubtedly a strong government interest in\r\nwarning officers about such possibilities, but neither the\r\nUnited States nor California offers evidence to suggest\r\nthat their concerns are based on actual experience. The\r\nproposed consideration would also represent a broadening\r\nof Chimel’s concern that an arrestee himself might grab a\r\nweapon and use it against an officer “to resist arrest or\r\neffect his escape.” 395 U. S., at 763. And any such threats\r\nfrom outside the arrest scene do not “lurk[ ] in all custodial\r\narrests.” Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 14–15. Accordingly, the\r\ninterest in protecting officer safety does not justify dis-\r\npensing with the warrant requirement across the board.\r\nTo the extent dangers to arresting officers may be impli-\r\ncated in a particular way in a particular case, they are\r\nbetter addressed through consideration of case-specific\r\nexceptions to the warrant requirement, such as the one for\r\n12                 RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden, Md. Peniten-\r\ntiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299 (1967) (“The\r\nFourth Amendment does not require police officers to\r\ndelay in the course of an investigation if to do so would\r\ngravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.”).\r\n                              2\r\n   The United States and California focus primarily on the\r\nsecond Chimel rationale: preventing the destruction of\r\nevidence.\r\n   Both Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have\r\nseized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction\r\nof evidence while seeking a warrant. See Brief for Peti-\r\ntioner in No. 13–132, p. 20; Brief for Respondent in No.\r\n13–212, p. 41. That is a sensible concession. See Illinois\r\nv. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333 (2001); Chadwick,\r\nsupra, at 13, and n. 8. And once law enforcement officers\r\nhave secured a cell phone, there is no longer any risk that\r\nthe arrestee himself will be able to delete incriminating\r\ndata from the phone.\r\n   The United States and California argue that infor-\r\nmation on a cell phone may nevertheless be vulnerable to\r\ntwo types of evidence destruction unique to digital data—\r\nremote wiping and data encryption. Remote wiping occurs\r\nwhen a phone, connected to a wireless network, receives a\r\nsignal that erases stored data. This can happen when a\r\nthird party sends a remote signal or when a phone is\r\npreprogrammed to delete data upon entering or leaving\r\ncertain geographic areas (so-called “geofencing”). See\r\nDept. of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and\r\nTechnology, R. Ayers, S. Brothers, & W. Jansen, Guide-\r\nlines on Mobile Device Forensics (Draft) 29, 31 (SP 800–\r\n101 Rev. 1, Sept. 2013) (hereinafter Ayers). Encryption is\r\na security feature that some modern cell phones use in\r\naddition to password protection. When such phones lock,\r\ndata becomes protected by sophisticated encryption that\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrenders a phone all but “unbreakable” unless police know\r\nthe password. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\r\nNo. 13–132, p. 11.\r\n   As an initial matter, these broader concerns about the\r\nloss of evidence are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a\r\ndefendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or\r\ndestroy evidence within his reach. See 395 U. S., at 763–\r\n764. With respect to remote wiping, the Government’s\r\nprimary concern turns on the actions of third parties who\r\nare not present at the scene of arrest. And data encryp-\r\ntion is even further afield. There, the Government focuses\r\non the ordinary operation of a phone’s security features,\r\napart from any active attempt by a defendant or his asso-\r\nciates to conceal or destroy evidence upon arrest.\r\n   We have also been given little reason to believe that\r\neither problem is prevalent. The briefing reveals only a\r\ncouple of anecdotal examples of remote wiping triggered\r\nby an arrest. See Brief for Association of State Criminal\r\nInvestigative Agencies et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 13–\r\n132, pp. 9–10; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132,\r\np. 48. Similarly, the opportunities for officers to search a\r\npassword-protected phone before data becomes encrypted\r\nare quite limited. Law enforcement officers are very\r\nunlikely to come upon such a phone in an unlocked state\r\nbecause most phones lock at the touch of a button or, as a\r\ndefault, after some very short period of inactivity. See,\r\ne.g., iPhone User Guide for iOS 7.1 Software 10 (2014)\r\n(default lock after about one minute). This may explain\r\nwhy the encryption argument was not made until the\r\nmerits stage in this Court, and has never been considered\r\nby the Courts of Appeals.\r\n   Moreover, in situations in which an arrest might trigger\r\na remote-wipe attempt or an officer discovers an unlocked\r\nphone, it is not clear that the ability to conduct a warrant-\r\nless search would make much of a difference. The need to\r\neffect the arrest, secure the scene, and tend to other press-\r\n14                 RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning matters means that law enforcement officers may well\r\nnot be able to turn their attention to a cell phone right\r\naway. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50; see also\r\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–132, at\r\n19. Cell phone data would be vulnerable to remote wiping\r\nfrom the time an individual anticipates arrest to the time\r\nany eventual search of the phone is completed, which\r\nmight be at the station house hours later. Likewise, an\r\nofficer who seizes a phone in an unlocked state might not\r\nbe able to begin his search in the short time remaining\r\nbefore the phone locks and data becomes encrypted.\r\n   In any event, as to remote wiping, law enforcement is\r\nnot without specific means to address the threat. Remote\r\nwiping can be fully prevented by disconnecting a phone\r\nfrom the network. There are at least two simple ways to\r\ndo this: First, law enforcement officers can turn the phone\r\noff or remove its battery. Second, if they are concerned\r\nabout encryption or other potential problems, they can\r\nleave a phone powered on and place it in an enclosure that\r\nisolates the phone from radio waves. See Ayers 30–31.\r\nSuch devices are commonly called “Faraday bags,” after\r\nthe English scientist Michael Faraday. They are essen-\r\ntially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil: cheap, light-\r\nweight, and easy to use. See Brief for Criminal Law Pro-\r\nfessors as Amici Curiae 9. They may not be a complete\r\nanswer to the problem, see Ayers 32, but at least for now\r\nthey provide a reasonable response. In fact, a number of\r\nlaw enforcement agencies around the country already\r\nencourage the use of Faraday bags. See, e.g., Dept. of\r\nJustice, National Institute of Justice, Electronic Crime\r\nScene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders 14, 32\r\n(2d ed. Apr. 2008); Brief for Criminal Law Professors as\r\nAmici Curiae 4–6.\r\n   To the extent that law enforcement still has specific\r\nconcerns about the potential loss of evidence in a particu-\r\nlar case, there remain more targeted ways to address\r\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

If “the police are truly confronted with a\r\n‘now or never’ situation,”—for example, circumstances\r\nsuggesting that a defendant’s phone will be the target of\r\nan imminent remote-wipe attempt—they may be able to\r\nrely on exigent circumstances to search the phone imme-\r\ndiately. Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\r\n(slip op., at 10) (quoting Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S.\r\n496, 505 (1973); some internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nOr, if officers happen to seize a phone in an unlocked\r\nstate, they may be able to disable a phone’s automatic-lock\r\nfeature in order to prevent the phone from locking and\r\nencrypting data. See App. to Reply Brief in No. 13–132, p.\r\n3a (diagramming the few necessary steps). Such a preven-\r\ntive measure could be analyzed under the principles set\r\nforth in our decision in McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, which\r\napproved officers’ reasonable steps to secure a scene to\r\npreserve evidence while they awaited a warrant. See id.,\r\nat 331–333.\r\n                              B\r\n   The search incident to arrest exception rests not only on\r\nthe heightened government interests at stake in a volatile\r\narrest situation, but also on an arrestee’s reduced privacy\r\ninterests upon being taken into police custody. Robinson\r\nfocused primarily on the first of those rationales. But it\r\nalso quoted with approval then-Judge Cardozo’s account of\r\nthe historical basis for the search incident to arrest excep-\r\ntion: “Search of the person becomes lawful when grounds\r\nfor arrest and accusation have been discovered, and the\r\nlaw is in the act of subjecting the body of the accused to its\r\nphysical dominion.” 414 U. S., at 232 (quoting People v.\r\nChiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923));\r\nsee also 414 U. S., at 237 (Powell, J., concurring) (“an\r\nindividual lawfully subjected to a custodial arrest retains\r\nno significant Fourth Amendment interest in the privacy\r\nof his person”). Put simply, a patdown of Robinson’s cloth-\r\n16                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning and an inspection of the cigarette pack found in his\r\npocket constituted only minor additional intrusions com-\r\npared to the substantial government authority exercised\r\nin taking Robinson into custody. See Chadwick, 433 U. S.,\r\nat 16, n. 10 (searches of a person are justified in part by\r\n“reduced expectations of privacy caused by the arrest”).\r\n   The fact that an arrestee has diminished privacy inter-\r\nests does not mean that the Fourth Amendment falls out\r\nof the picture entirely. Not every search “is acceptable\r\nsolely because a person is in custody.” Maryland v. King,\r\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). To the contrary,\r\nwhen “privacy-related concerns are weighty enough” a\r\n“search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the di-\r\nminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.” Ibid.\r\nOne such example, of course, is Chimel. Chimel refused to\r\n“characteriz[e] the invasion of privacy that results from a\r\ntop-to-bottom search of a man’s house as ‘minor.’ ” 395\r\nU. S., at 766–767, n. 12. Because a search of the arrestee’s\r\nentire house was a substantial invasion beyond the arrest\r\nitself, the Court concluded that a warrant was required.\r\n   Robinson is the only decision from this Court applying\r\nChimel to a search of the contents of an item found on an\r\narrestee’s person. In an earlier case, this Court had ap-\r\nproved a search of a zipper bag carried by an arrestee, but\r\nthe Court analyzed only the validity of the arrest itself.\r\nSee Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307, 310–311\r\n(1959). Lower courts applying Robinson and Chimel,\r\nhowever, have approved searches of a variety of personal\r\nitems carried by an arrestee. See, e.g., United States v.\r\nCarrion, 809 F. 2d 1120, 1123, 1128 (CA5 1987) (billfold\r\nand address book); United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d\r\n1374, 1383–1384 (CA11 1982) (wallet); United States v.\r\nLee, 501 F. 2d 890, 892 (CADC 1974) (purse).\r\n   The United States asserts that a search of all data\r\nstored on a cell phone is “materially indistinguishable”\r\nfrom searches of these sorts of physical items.

That is like saying a\r\nride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a\r\nflight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A\r\nto point B, but little else justifies lumping them together.\r\nModern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy con-\r\ncerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a ciga-\r\nrette pack, a wallet, or a purse. A conclusion that inspect-\r\ning the contents of an arrestee’s pockets works no\r\nsubstantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the\r\narrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items,\r\nbut any extension of that reasoning to digital data has to\r\nrest on its own bottom.\r\n                               1\r\n   Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualita-\r\ntive sense from other objects that might be kept on an\r\narrestee’s person. The term “cell phone” is itself mislead-\r\ning shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicom-\r\nputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as\r\na telephone. They could just as easily be called cameras,\r\nvideo players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, librar-\r\nies, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.\r\n   One of the most notable distinguishing features of mod-\r\nern cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before\r\ncell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical\r\nrealities and tended as a general matter to constitute only\r\na narrow intrusion on privacy. See Kerr, Foreword: Ac-\r\ncounting for Technological Change, 36 Harv. J. L. & Pub.\r\nPol’y 403, 404–405 (2013). Most people cannot lug around\r\nevery piece of mail they have received for the past several\r\nmonths, every picture they have taken, or every book or\r\narticle they have read—nor would they have any reason to\r\nattempt to do so. And if they did, they would have to drag\r\nbehind them a trunk of the sort held to require a search\r\nwarrant in Chadwick, supra, rather than a container the\r\nsize of the cigarette package in Robinson.\r\n18                    RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   But the possible intrusion on privacy is not physically\r\nlimited in the same way when it comes to cell phones. The\r\ncurrent top-selling smart phone has a standard capacity of\r\n16 gigabytes (and is available with up to 64 gigabytes).\r\nSixteen gigabytes translates to millions of pages of text,\r\nthousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos. See Kerr,\r\nsupra, at 404; Brief for Center for Democracy & Technol-\r\nogy et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8. Cell phones couple that\r\ncapacity with the ability to store many different types of\r\ninformation: Even the most basic phones that sell for less\r\nthan $20 might hold photographs, picture messages, text\r\nmessages, Internet browsing history, a calendar, a thousand-\r\nentry phone book, and so on. See id., at 30; United States\r\nv. Flores-Lopez, 670 F. 3d 803, 806 (CA7 2012). We expect\r\nthat the gulf between physical practicability and digital\r\ncapacity will only continue to widen in the future.\r\n   The storage capacity of cell phones has several interre-\r\nlated consequences for privacy. First, a cell phone collects\r\nin one place many distinct types of information—an ad-\r\ndress, a note, a prescription, a bank statement, a video—\r\nthat reveal much more in combination than any isolated\r\nrecord. Second, a cell phone’s capacity allows even just\r\none type of information to convey far more than previously\r\npossible. The sum of an individual’s private life can be\r\nreconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled\r\nwith dates, locations, and descriptions; the same cannot be\r\nsaid of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked into a\r\nwallet. Third, the data on a phone can date back to the\r\npurchase of the phone, or even earlier. A person might\r\ncarry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding him to call\r\nMr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his communi-\r\ncations with Mr. Jones for the past several months, as\r\nwould routinely be kept on a phone.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 Because the United States and California agree that these cases\r\n\r\ninvolve searches incident to arrest, these cases do not implicate the\r\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                19\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Finally, there is an element of pervasiveness that char-\r\nacterizes cell phones but not physical records. Prior to the\r\ndigital age, people did not typically carry a cache of sensi-\r\ntive personal information with them as they went about\r\ntheir day. Now it is the person who is not carrying a cell\r\nphone, with all that it contains, who is the exception.\r\nAccording to one poll, nearly three-quarters of smart\r\nphone users report being within five feet of their phones\r\nmost of the time, with 12% admitting that they even use\r\ntheir phones in the shower. See Harris Interactive, 2013\r\nMobile Consumer Habits Study (June 2013). A decade ago\r\npolice officers searching an arrestee might have occasion-\r\nally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a\r\ndiary. See, e.g., United States v. Frankenberry, 387 F. 2d\r\n337 (CA2 1967) (per curiam). But those discoveries were\r\nlikely to be few and far between. Today, by contrast, it is\r\nno exaggeration to say that many of the more than 90% of\r\nAmerican adults who own a cell phone keep on their per-\r\nson a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—\r\nfrom the mundane to the intimate. See Ontario v. Quon,\r\n560 U. S. 746, 760 (2010). Allowing the police to scrutinize\r\nsuch records on a routine basis is quite different from\r\nallowing them to search a personal item or two in the\r\noccasional case.\r\n   Although the data stored on a cell phone is distin-\r\nguished from physical records by quantity alone, certain\r\ntypes of data are also qualitatively different. An Internet\r\nsearch and browsing history, for example, can be found on\r\nan Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individu-\r\nal’s private interests or concerns—perhaps a search for\r\ncertain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits\r\nto WebMD. Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a\r\nperson has been. Historic location information is a stand-\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nquestion whether the collection or inspection of aggregated digital\r\n\r\ninformation amounts to a search under other circumstances.\r\n\r\n20                 RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nard feature on many smart phones and can reconstruct\r\nsomeone’s specific movements down to the minute, not\r\nonly around town but also within a particular building.\r\nSee United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\r\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (“GPS monitor-\r\ning generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person’s\r\npublic movements that reflects a wealth of detail about\r\nher familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual\r\nassociations.”).\r\n  Mobile application software on a cell phone, or “apps,”\r\noffer a range of tools for managing detailed information\r\nabout all aspects of a person’s life. There are apps for\r\nDemocratic Party news and Republican Party news; apps\r\nfor alcohol, drug, and gambling addictions; apps for shar-\r\ning prayer requests; apps for tracking pregnancy symp-\r\ntoms; apps for planning your budget; apps for every con-\r\nceivable hobby or pastime; apps for improving your\r\nromantic life. There are popular apps for buying or selling\r\njust about anything, and the records of such transactions\r\nmay be accessible on the phone indefinitely. There are\r\nover a million apps available in each of the two major app\r\nstores; the phrase “there’s an app for that” is now part of\r\nthe popular lexicon. The average smart phone user has\r\ninstalled 33 apps, which together can form a revealing\r\nmontage of the user’s life. See Brief for Electronic Privacy\r\nInformation Center as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–132, p. 9.\r\n  In 1926, Learned Hand observed (in an opinion later\r\nquoted in Chimel) that it is “a totally different thing to\r\nsearch a man’s pockets and use against him what they\r\ncontain, from ransacking his house for everything which\r\nmay incriminate him.” United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16\r\nF. 2d 202, 203 (CA2). If his pockets contain a cell phone,\r\nhowever, that is no longer true. Indeed, a cell phone\r\nsearch would typically expose to the government far more\r\nthan the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not\r\nonly contains in digital form many sensitive records previ-\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460,\r\nn. 4 (1981) (describing a “container” as “any object capable\r\nof holding another object”). But the analogy crumbles\r\nentirely when a cell phone is used to access data located\r\nelsewhere, at the tap of a screen. That is what cell\r\nphones, with increasing frequency, are designed to do by\r\ntaking advantage of “cloud computing.” Cloud computing\r\nis the capacity of Internet-connected devices to display\r\ndata stored on remote servers rather than on the device\r\nitself. Cell phone users often may not know whether\r\nparticular information is stored on the device or in the\r\ncloud, and it generally makes little difference. See Brief\r\nfor Electronic Privacy Information Center in No. 13–132,\r\nat 12–14, 20. Moreover, the same type of data may be\r\nstored locally on the device for one user and in the cloud\r\nfor another.\r\n   The United States concedes that the search incident to\r\narrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of\r\nfiles accessed remotely—that is, a search of files stored in\r\nthe cloud. See Brief for United States in No. 13–212, at\r\n43–44. Such a search would be like finding a key in a\r\nsuspect’s pocket and arguing that it allowed law enforce-\r\nment to unlock and search a house. But officers searching\r\na phone’s data would not typically know whether the\r\ninformation they are viewing was stored locally at the\r\ntime of the arrest or has been pulled from the cloud.\r\n22                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  Although the Government recognizes the problem, its\r\nproposed solutions are unclear. It suggests that officers\r\ncould disconnect a phone from the network before search-\r\ning the device—the very solution whose feasibility it con-\r\ntested with respect to the threat of remote wiping. Com-\r\npare Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50–51, with Tr. of\r\nOral Arg. in No. 13–212, pp. 13–14. Alternatively, the\r\nGovernment proposes that law enforcement agencies\r\n“develop protocols to address” concerns raised by cloud\r\ncomputing. Reply Brief in No. 13–212, pp. 14–15. Proba-\r\nbly a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution\r\nto gain the right to government agency protocols. The\r\npossibility that a search might extend well beyond papers\r\nand effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee is yet\r\nanother reason that the privacy interests here dwarf those\r\nin Robinson.\r\n                              C\r\n  Apart from their arguments for a direct extension of\r\nRobinson, the United States and California offer various\r\nfallback options for permitting warrantless cell phone\r\nsearches under certain circumstances. Each of the pro-\r\nposals is flawed and contravenes our general preference to\r\nprovide clear guidance to law enforcement through cate-\r\ngorical rules. “[I]f police are to have workable rules, the\r\nbalancing of the competing interests . . . ‘must in large\r\npart be done on a categorical basis—not in an ad hoc, case-\r\nby-case fashion by individual police officers.’ ” Michigan v.\r\nSummers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19 (1981) (quoting Duna-\r\nway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 219–220 (1979) (White, J.,\r\nconcurring)).\r\n  The United States first proposes that the Gant standard\r\nbe imported from the vehicle context, allowing a warrant-\r\nless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is rea-\r\nsonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the\r\ncrime of arrest. But Gant relied on “circumstances unique\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto the vehicle context” to endorse a search solely for the\r\npurpose of gathering evidence. 556 U. S., at 343. JUSTICE\r\nSCALIA’s Thornton opinion, on which Gant was based,\r\nexplained that those unique circumstances are “a reduced\r\nexpectation of privacy” and “heightened law enforcement\r\nneeds” when it comes to motor vehicles. 541 U. S., at 631;\r\nsee also Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S., at 303–304. For\r\nreasons that we have explained, cell phone searches bear\r\nneither of those characteristics.\r\n  At any rate, a Gant standard would prove no practical\r\nlimit at all when it comes to cell phone searches. In the\r\nvehicle context, Gant generally protects against searches\r\nfor evidence of past crimes. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and\r\nSeizure §7.1(d), at 709, and n. 191. In the cell phone\r\ncontext, however, it is reasonable to expect that incrimi-\r\nnating information will be found on a phone regardless of\r\nwhen the crime occurred. Similarly, in the vehicle context\r\nGant restricts broad searches resulting from minor crimes\r\nsuch as traffic violations. See id., §7.1(d), at 713, and n.\r\n204. That would not necessarily be true for cell phones. It\r\nwould be a particularly inexperienced or unimaginative\r\nlaw enforcement officer who could not come up with sev-\r\neral reasons to suppose evidence of just about any crime\r\ncould be found on a cell phone. Even an individual pulled\r\nover for something as basic as speeding might well have\r\nlocational data dispositive of guilt on his phone. An indi-\r\nvidual pulled over for reckless driving might have evi-\r\ndence on the phone that shows whether he was texting\r\nwhile driving. The sources of potential pertinent infor-\r\nmation are virtually unlimited, so applying the Gant\r\nstandard to cell phones would in effect give “police officers\r\nunbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person’s\r\nprivate effects.” 556 U. S., at 345.\r\n  The United States also proposes a rule that would re-\r\nstrict the scope of a cell phone search to those areas of the\r\nphone where an officer reasonably believes that infor-\r\n24                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmation relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or\r\nofficer safety will be discovered. See Brief for United\r\nStates in No. 13–212, at 51–53. This approach would\r\nagain impose few meaningful constraints on officers. The\r\nproposed categories would sweep in a great deal of infor-\r\nmation, and officers would not always be able to discern in\r\nadvance what information would be found where.\r\n  We also reject the United States’ final suggestion that\r\nofficers should always be able to search a phone’s call log,\r\nas they did in Wurie’s case. The Government relies on\r\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979), which held that\r\nno warrant was required to use a pen register at telephone\r\ncompany premises to identify numbers dialed by a particu-\r\nlar caller. The Court in that case, however, concluded that\r\nthe use of a pen register was not a “search” at all under\r\nthe Fourth Amendment. See id., at 745–746. There is no\r\ndispute here that the officers engaged in a search of\r\nWurie’s cell phone. Moreover, call logs typically contain\r\nmore than just phone numbers; they include any identify-\r\ning information that an individual might add, such as the\r\nlabel “my house” in Wurie’s case.\r\n  Finally, at oral argument California suggested a differ-\r\nent limiting principle, under which officers could search\r\ncell phone data if they could have obtained the same in-\r\nformation from a pre-digital counterpart. See Tr. of Oral\r\nArg. in No. 13–132, at 38–43; see also Flores-Lopez, 670\r\nF. 3d, at 807 (“If police are entitled to open a pocket diary\r\nto copy the owner’s address, they should be entitled to\r\nturn on a cell phone to learn its number.”). But the fact\r\nthat a search in the pre-digital era could have turned up a\r\nphotograph or two in a wallet does not justify a search of\r\nthousands of photos in a digital gallery. The fact that\r\nsomeone could have tucked a paper bank statement in a\r\npocket does not justify a search of every bank statement\r\nfrom the last five years. And to make matters worse, such\r\nan analogue test would allow law enforcement to search a\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           25\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrange of items contained on a phone, even though people\r\nwould be unlikely to carry such a variety of information in\r\nphysical form. In Riley’s case, for example, it is implausi-\r\nble that he would have strolled around with video tapes,\r\nphoto albums, and an address book all crammed into his\r\npockets. But because each of those items has a pre-digital\r\nanalogue, police under California’s proposal would be able\r\nto search a phone for all of those items—a significant\r\ndiminution of privacy.\r\n  In addition, an analogue test would launch courts on a\r\ndifficult line-drawing expedition to determine which digi-\r\ntal files are comparable to physical records. Is an e-mail\r\nequivalent to a letter? Is a voicemail equivalent to a\r\nphone message slip? It is not clear how officers could\r\nmake these kinds of decisions before conducting a search,\r\nor how courts would apply the proposed rule after the fact.\r\nAn analogue test would “keep defendants and judges\r\nguessing for years to come.” Sykes v. United States, 564\r\nU. S. 1, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7)\r\n(discussing the Court’s analogue test under the Armed\r\nCareer Criminal Act).\r\n                            IV\r\n  We cannot deny that our decision today will have an\r\nimpact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime.\r\nCell phones have become important tools in facilitating\r\ncoordination and communication among members of crim-\r\ninal enterprises, and can provide valuable incriminating\r\ninformation about dangerous criminals. Privacy comes at\r\na cost.\r\n  Our holding, of course, is not that the information on a\r\ncell phone is immune from search; it is instead that a\r\nwarrant is generally required before such a search, even\r\nwhen a cell phone is seized incident to arrest. Our cases\r\nhave historically recognized that the warrant requirement\r\nis “an important working part of our machinery of gov-\r\n26                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nernment,” not merely “an inconvenience to be somehow\r\n‘weighed’ against the claims of police efficiency.” Coolidge\r\nv. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 481 (1971). Recent\r\ntechnological advances similar to those discussed here\r\nhave, in addition, made the process of obtaining a warrant\r\nitself more efficient. See McNeely, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip\r\nop., at 11–12); id., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in\r\npart and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 8) (describing\r\njurisdiction where “police officers can e-mail warrant\r\nrequests to judges’ iPads [and] judges have signed such\r\nwarrants and e-mailed them back to officers in less than\r\n15 minutes”).\r\n   Moreover, even though the search incident to arrest\r\nexception does not apply to cell phones, other case-specific\r\nexceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a\r\nparticular phone. “One well-recognized exception applies\r\nwhen ‘ “the exigencies of the situation” make the needs of\r\nlaw enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search\r\nis objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.’ ”\r\nKentucky v. King, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting\r\nMincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978)). Such exi-\r\ngencies could include the need to prevent the imminent\r\ndestruction of evidence in individual cases, to pursue a\r\nfleeing suspect, and to assist persons who are seriously\r\ninjured or are threatened with imminent injury. 563\r\nU. S., at ___. In Chadwick, for example, the Court held\r\nthat the exception for searches incident to arrest did not\r\njustify a search of the trunk at issue, but noted that “if\r\nofficers have reason to believe that luggage contains some\r\nimmediately dangerous instrumentality, such as explo-\r\nsives, it would be foolhardy to transport it to the station\r\nhouse without opening the luggage.” 433 U. S., at 15, n. 9.\r\n   In light of the availability of the exigent circumstances\r\nexception, there is no reason to believe that law enforce-\r\nment officers will not be able to address some of the more\r\nextreme hypotheticals that have been suggested: a suspect\r\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The\r\ndefendants here recognize—indeed, they stress—that such\r\nfact-specific threats may justify a warrantless search of\r\ncell phone data. See Reply Brief in No. 13–132, at 8–9;\r\nBrief for Respondent in No. 13–212, at 30, 41. The critical\r\npoint is that, unlike the search incident to arrest excep-\r\ntion, the exigent circumstances exception requires a court\r\nto examine whether an emergency justified a warrantless\r\nsearch in each particular case. See McNeely, supra, at ___\r\n(slip op., at 6).2\r\n                        *    *    *\r\n   Our cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment\r\nwas the founding generation’s response to the reviled\r\n“general warrants” and “writs of assistance” of the colonial\r\nera, which allowed British officers to rummage through\r\nhomes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal\r\nactivity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the\r\ndriving forces behind the Revolution itself. In 1761, the\r\npatriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston denounc-\r\ning the use of writs of assistance. A young John Adams\r\nwas there, and he would later write that “[e]very man of a\r\ncrowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did,\r\nready to take arms against writs of assistance.” 10 Works\r\nof John Adams 247–248 (C.

But the majority concluded that the Government had\r\nnot made an exigent circumstances argument. See id., at 1. The\r\nGovernment acknowledges the same in this Court.

I write separately to address\r\ntwo points.\r\n                              I\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n  First, I am not convinced at this time that the ancient\r\nrule on searches incident to arrest is based exclusively (or\r\neven primarily) on the need to protect the safety of arrest-\r\ning officers and the need to prevent the destruction of\r\nevidence. Cf. ante, at 9. This rule antedates the adoption\r\nof the Fourth Amendment by at least a century. See T.\r\nClancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpre-\r\ntation 340 (2008); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional\r\n2                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nInterpretation 28 (1969); Amar, Fourth Amendment First\r\nPrinciples, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 764 (1994). In Weeks v.\r\nUnited States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914), we held that the\r\nFourth Amendment did not disturb this rule. See also\r\nTaylor, supra, at 45; Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 105 Yale L. J. 393, 401 (1995) (“The\r\npower to search incident to arrest—a search of the arrested\r\nsuspect’s person . . .—was well established in the mid-\r\neighteenth century, and nothing in . . . the Fourth\r\nAmendment changed that”). And neither in Weeks nor in\r\nany of the authorities discussing the old common-law rule\r\nhave I found any suggestion that it was based exclusively\r\nor primarily on the need to protect arresting officers or to\r\nprevent the destruction of evidence.\r\n  On the contrary, when pre-Weeks authorities discussed\r\nthe basis for the rule, what was mentioned was the need to\r\nobtain probative evidence. For example, an 1839 case\r\nstated that “it is clear, and beyond doubt, that . . . consta-\r\nbles . . . are entitled, upon a lawful arrest by them of one\r\ncharged with treason or felony, to take and detain prop-\r\nerty found in his possession which will form material evi-\r\ndence in his prosecution for that crime.” See Dillon v.\r\nO’Brien, 16 Cox Crim. Cas. 245, 249–251 (1887) (citing\r\nRegina, v. Frost, 9 Car. & P. 129, 173 Eng. Rep. 771)). The\r\ncourt noted that the origins of that rule “deriv[e] from the\r\ninterest which the State has in a person guilty (or reason-\r\nably believed to be guilty) of a crime being brought to\r\njustice, and in a prosecution, once commenced, being\r\ndetermined in due course of law.” 16 Cox Crim. Cas., at\r\n249–250. See also Holker v.

W. 1090, 1093 (1897).\r\n  Two 19th-century treatises that this Court has previ-\r\nously cited in connection with the origin of the search-\r\nincident-to-arrest rule, see Weeks, supra, at 392, suggest\r\nthe same rationale. See F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading\r\nand Practice §60, p. 45 (8th ed. 1880) (“Those arresting a\r\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Bishop, Criminal\r\nProcedure §§210–212, p. 127 (2d ed. 1872) (if an arresting\r\nofficer finds “about the prisoner’s person, or otherwise in\r\nhis possession, either goods or moneys which there is\r\nreason to believe are connected with the supposed crime as\r\nits fruits, or as the instruments with which it was commit-\r\nted, or as directly furnishing evidence relating to the\r\ntransaction, he may take the same, and hold them to be\r\ndisposed of as the court may direct”).\r\n   What ultimately convinces me that the rule is not closely\r\nlinked to the need for officer safety and evidence preser-\r\nvation is that these rationales fail to explain the rule’s\r\nwell-recognized scope. It has long been accepted that\r\nwritten items found on the person of an arrestee may be\r\nexamined and used at trial.* But once these items are\r\n——————\r\n   * Cf. Hill v. California, 401 U.

LaFave, Search and Seizure §5.2(c), p. 144 (5th ed. 2012)\r\n(“Lower courts, in applying Robinson, have deemed evidentiary searches\r\nof an arrested person to be virtually unlimited”); W.

CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\ntaken away from an arrestee (something that obviously\r\nmust be done before the items are read), there is no risk\r\nthat the arrestee will destroy them. Nor is there any risk\r\nthat leaving these items unread will endanger the arrest-\r\ning officers.\r\n  The idea that officer safety and the preservation of\r\nevidence are the sole reasons for allowing a warrantless\r\nsearch incident to arrest appears to derive from the\r\nCourt’s reasoning in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752\r\n(1969), a case that involved the lawfulness of a search of\r\nthe scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. As I\r\nhave explained, Chimel’s reasoning is questionable, see\r\nArizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 361–363 (2009) (ALITO, J.,\r\ndissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that rea-\r\nsoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of\r\nthe person of arrestees.\r\n                            B\r\n  Despite my view on the point discussed above, I agree\r\nthat we should not mechanically apply the rule used in the\r\npredigital era to the search of a cell phone. Many cell\r\nphones now in use are capable of storing and accessing a\r\nquantity of information, some highly personal, that no\r\nperson would ever have had on his person in hard-copy\r\nform. This calls for a new balancing of law enforcement\r\nand privacy interests.\r\n  The Court strikes this balance in favor of privacy inter-\r\nests with respect to all cell phones and all information\r\nfound in them, and this approach leads to anomalies. For\r\nexample, the Court’s broad holding favors information in\r\ndigital form over information in hard-copy form. Suppose\r\nthat two suspects are arrested. Suspect number one has\r\nin his pocket a monthly bill for his land-line phone, and\r\n\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nhis surface clothing but his body, luggage, and saddlebags would be\r\n\r\nsearched”). \r\n\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nthe bill lists an incriminating call to a long-distance num-\r\nber. He also has in his a wallet a few snapshots, and one\r\nof these is incriminating. Suspect number two has in his\r\npocket a cell phone, the call log of which shows a call to\r\nthe same incriminating number. In addition, a number of\r\nphotos are stored in the memory of the cell phone, and one\r\nof these is incriminating. Under established law, the\r\npolice may seize and examine the phone bill and the snap-\r\nshots in the wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under\r\nthe Court’s holding today, the information stored in the\r\ncell phone is out.\r\n  While the Court’s approach leads to anomalies, I do not\r\nsee a workable alternative. Law enforcement officers need\r\nclear rules regarding searches incident to arrest, and it\r\nwould take many cases and many years for the courts to\r\ndevelop more nuanced rules. And during that time, the\r\nnature of the electronic devices that ordinary Americans\r\ncarry on their persons would continue to change.\r\n                             II\r\n  This brings me to my second point. While I agree with\r\nthe holding of the Court, I would reconsider the question\r\npresented here if either Congress or state legislatures,\r\nafter assessing the legitimate needs of law enforcement\r\nand the privacy interests of cell phone owners, enact legis-\r\nlation that draws reasonable distinctions based on catego-\r\nries of information or perhaps other variables.\r\n  The regulation of electronic surveillance provides an\r\ninstructive example. After this Court held that electronic\r\nsurveillance constitutes a search even when no property\r\ninterest is invaded, see Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.\r\n347, 353–359 (1967), Congress responded by enacting Title\r\nIII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\r\n1968, 82 Stat. 211. See also 18 U. S. C. §2510 et seq.\r\nSince that time, electronic surveillance has been governed\r\nprimarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the stat-\r\n6                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nute, which authorizes but imposes detailed restrictions on\r\nelectronic surveillance. See ibid.\r\n  Modern cell phones are of great value for both lawful\r\nand unlawful purposes. They can be used in committing\r\nmany serious crimes, and they present new and difficult\r\nlaw enforcement problems. See Brief for United States in\r\nNo. 13–212, pp. 2–3. At the same time, because of the role\r\nthat these devices have come to play in contemporary life,\r\nsearching their contents implicates very sensitive privacy\r\ninterests that this Court is poorly positioned to under-\r\nstand and evaluate. Many forms of modern technology are\r\nmaking it easier and easier for both government and\r\nprivate entities to amass a wealth of information about\r\nthe lives of ordinary Americans, and at the same time,\r\nmany ordinary Americans are choosing to make public\r\nmuch information that was seldom revealed to outsiders\r\njust a few decades ago.\r\n  In light of these developments, it would be very unfor-\r\ntunate if privacy protection in the 21st century were left\r\nprimarily to the federal courts using the blunt instrument\r\nof the Fourth Amendment. Legislatures, elected by the\r\npeople, are in a better position than we are to assess and\r\nrespond to the changes that have already occurred and\r\nthose that almost certainly will take place in the future.\r\n</pre>", "id": 2680439, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/06/25/riley_v._california.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\r\n\r\n                                       Syllabus\r\n\r\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\r\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\r\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\r\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\r\n       See United States v.

Argued April 29, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014*\r\nIn No. 13–132, petitioner Riley was stopped for a traffic violation,\r\n  which eventually led to his arrest on weapons charges. An officer\r\n  searching Riley incident to the arrest seized a cell phone from Riley’s\r\n  pants pocket. The officer accessed information on the phone and no-\r\n  ticed the repeated use of a term associated with a street gang. At the\r\n  police station two hours later, a detective specializing in gangs fur-\r\n  ther examined the phone’s digital contents. Based in part on photo-\r\n  graphs and videos that the detective found, the State charged Riley\r\n  in connection with a shooting that had occurred a few weeks earlier\r\n  and sought an enhanced sentence based on Riley’s gang membership.\r\n  Riley moved to suppress all evidence that the police had obtained\r\n  from his cell phone. The trial court denied the motion, and Riley was\r\n  convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed.\r\n     In No. 13–212, respondent Wurie was arrested after police ob-\r\n  served him participate in an apparent drug sale. At the police sta-\r\n  tion, the officers seized a cell phone from Wurie’s person and noticed\r\n  that the phone was receiving multiple calls from a source identified\r\n  as “my house” on its external screen. The officers opened the phone,\r\n  accessed its call log, determined the number associated with the “my\r\n  house” label, and traced that number to what they suspected was\r\n  Wurie’s apartment. They secured a search warrant and found drugs,\r\n  a firearm and ammunition, and cash in the ensuing search. Wurie\r\n  was then charged with drug and firearm offenses. He moved to sup-\r\n  press the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment. The\r\n  District Court denied the motion, and Wurie was convicted.

CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    First Circuit reversed the denial of the motion to suppress and vacat-\r\n    ed the relevant convictions.\r\nHeld: The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital\r\n information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been\r\n arrested. Pp. 5–28.\r\n    (a) A warrantless search is reasonable only if it falls within a spe-\r\n cific exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. See\r\n Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The well-established exception\r\n at issue here applies when a warrantless search is conducted incident\r\n to a lawful arrest.\r\n    Three related precedents govern the extent to which officers may\r\n search property found on or near an arrestee. Chimel v. California,\r\n 395 U. S. 752, requires that a search incident to arrest be limited to\r\n the area within the arrestee’s immediate control, where it is justified\r\n by the interests in officer safety and in preventing evidence destruc-\r\n tion. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, the Court applied\r\n the Chimel analysis to a search of a cigarette pack found on the ar-\r\n restee’s person. It held that the risks identified in Chimel are pre-\r\n sent in all custodial arrests, 414 U. S., at 235, even when there is no\r\n specific concern about the loss of evidence or the threat to officers in a\r\n particular case, id., at 236. The trilogy concludes with Arizona v.\r\n Gant, 556 U. S. 332, which permits searches of a car where the ar-\r\n restee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger\r\n compartment, or where it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the\r\n crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle, id., at 343. Pp. 5–8.\r\n    (b) The Court declines to extend Robinson’s categorical rule to\r\n searches of data stored on cell phones. Absent more precise guidance\r\n from the founding era, the Court generally determines whether to ex-\r\n empt a given type of search from the warrant requirement “by as-\r\n sessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an in-\r\n dividual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed\r\n for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Wyoming v.\r\n Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300. That balance of interests supported\r\n the search incident to arrest exception in Robinson. But a search of\r\n digital information on a cell phone does not further the government\r\n interests identified in Chimel, and implicates substantially greater\r\n individual privacy interests than a brief physical search. Pp. 8–22.\r\n      (1) The digital data stored on cell phones does not present either\r\n Chimel risk. Pp. 10–15.\r\n         (i) Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a\r\n weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the arrestee’s es-\r\n cape. Officers may examine the phone’s physical aspects to ensure\r\n that it will not be used as a weapon, but the data on the phone can\r\n endanger no one. To the extent that a search of cell phone data\r\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nmight warn officers of an impending danger, e.g., that the arrestee’s\r\nconfederates are headed to the scene, such a concern is better ad-\r\ndressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the war-\r\nrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden,\r\nMd. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299. Pp. 10–12.\r\n       (ii) The United States and California raise concerns about the\r\ndestruction of evidence, arguing that, even if the cell phone is physi-\r\ncally secure, information on the cell phone remains vulnerable to re-\r\nmote wiping and data encryption. As an initial matter, those broad\r\nconcerns are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a defendant who re-\r\nsponds to arrest by trying to conceal or destroy evidence within his\r\nreach. The briefing also gives little indication that either problem is\r\nprevalent or that the opportunity to perform a search incident to ar-\r\nrest would be an effective solution. And, at least as to remote wiping,\r\nlaw enforcement currently has some technologies of its own for com-\r\nbatting the loss of evidence. Finally, law enforcement’s remaining\r\nconcerns in a particular case might be addressed by responding in a\r\ntargeted manner to urgent threats of remote wiping, see Missouri v.\r\nMcNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___, or by taking action to disable a phone’s\r\nlocking mechanism in order to secure the scene, see Illinois v. McAr-\r\nthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333. Pp. 12–15.\r\n     (2) A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee’s\r\npockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond\r\nthe arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but\r\nmore substantial privacy interests are at stake when digital data is\r\ninvolved. Pp. 15–22.\r\n       (i) Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative\r\nsense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee’s per-\r\nson. Notably, modern cell phones have an immense storage capacity.\r\nBefore cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical reali-\r\nties and generally constituted only a narrow intrusion on privacy.\r\nBut cell phones can store millions of pages of text, thousands of pic-\r\ntures, or hundreds of videos. This has several interrelated privacy\r\nconsequences. First, a cell phone collects in one place many distinct\r\ntypes of information that reveal much more in combination than any\r\nisolated record. Second, the phone’s capacity allows even just one\r\ntype of information to convey far more than previously possible.\r\nThird, data on the phone can date back for years. In addition, an el-\r\nement of pervasiveness characterizes cell phones but not physical\r\nrecords. A decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled\r\nacross a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the\r\nmore than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their\r\nperson a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives. Pp. 17–\r\n21.\r\n4                         RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n            (ii) The scope of the privacy interests at stake is further com-\r\n    plicated by the fact that the data viewed on many modern cell phones\r\n    may in fact be stored on a remote server. Thus, a search may extend\r\n    well beyond papers and effects in the physical proximity of an ar-\r\n    restee, a concern that the United States recognizes but cannot defini-\r\n    tively foreclose. Pp. 21–22.\r\n       (c) Fallback options offered by the United States and California are\r\n    flawed and contravene this Court’s general preference to provide\r\n    clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules. See\r\n    Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19. One possible rule is\r\n    to import the Gant standard from the vehicle context and allow a\r\n    warrantless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is reason-\r\n    able to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of ar-\r\n    rest. That proposal is not appropriate in this context, and would\r\n    prove no practical limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches.\r\n    Another possible rule is to restrict the scope of a cell phone search to\r\n    information relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or officer\r\n    safety. That proposal would again impose few meaningful con-\r\n    straints on officers. Finally, California suggests an analogue rule,\r\n    under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have\r\n    obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. That\r\n    proposal would allow law enforcement to search a broad range of\r\n    items contained on a phone even though people would be unlikely to\r\n    carry such a variety of information in physical form, and would\r\n    launch courts on a difficult line-drawing expedition to determine\r\n    which digital files are comparable to physical records. Pp. 22–25.\r\n       (d) It is true that this decision will have some impact on the ability\r\n    of law enforcement to combat crime. But the Court’s holding is not\r\n    that the information on a cell phone is immune from search; it is that\r\n    a warrant is generally required before a search. The warrant re-\r\n    quirement is an important component of the Court’s Fourth Amend-\r\n    ment jurisprudence, and warrants may be obtained with increasing\r\n    efficiency. In addition, although the search incident to arrest excep-\r\n    tion does not apply to cell phones, the continued availability of the ex-\r\n    igent circumstances exception may give law enforcement a justifica-\r\n    tion for a warrantless search in particular cases.

In\r\nthe course of the stop, the officer also learned that Riley’s\r\nlicense had been suspended. The officer impounded Ri-\r\nley’s car, pursuant to department policy, and another\r\n2                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nofficer conducted an inventory search of the car. Riley was\r\narrested for possession of concealed and loaded firearms\r\nwhen that search turned up two handguns under the car’s\r\nhood. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§12025(a)(1), 12031(a)(1)\r\n(West 2009).\r\n   An officer searched Riley incident to the arrest and\r\nfound items associated with the “Bloods” street gang. He\r\nalso seized a cell phone from Riley’s pants pocket. Accord-\r\ning to Riley’s uncontradicted assertion, the phone was a\r\n“smart phone,” a cell phone with a broad range of other\r\nfunctions based on advanced computing capability, large\r\nstorage capacity, and Internet connectivity. The officer\r\naccessed information on the phone and noticed that some\r\nwords (presumably in text messages or a contacts list)\r\nwere preceded by the letters “CK”—a label that, he be-\r\nlieved, stood for “Crip Killers,” a slang term for members\r\nof the Bloods gang.\r\n   At the police station about two hours after the arrest, a\r\ndetective specializing in gangs further examined the con-\r\ntents of the phone. The detective testified that he “went\r\nthrough” Riley’s phone “looking for evidence, because . . .\r\ngang members will often video themselves with guns or\r\ntake pictures of themselves with the guns.” App. in No.\r\n13–132, p. 20. Although there was “a lot of stuff ” on the\r\nphone, particular files that “caught [the detective’s] eye”\r\nincluded videos of young men sparring while someone\r\nyelled encouragement using the moniker “Blood.” Id., at\r\n11–13. The police also found photographs of Riley stand-\r\ning in front of a car they suspected had been involved in a\r\nshooting a few weeks earlier.\r\n   Riley was ultimately charged, in connection with that\r\nearlier shooting, with firing at an occupied vehicle, assault\r\nwith a semiautomatic firearm, and attempted murder.\r\nThe State alleged that Riley had committed those crimes\r\nfor the benefit of a criminal street gang, an aggravating\r\nfactor that carries an enhanced sentence.

He contended\r\nthat the searches of his phone violated the Fourth\r\nAmendment, because they had been performed without a\r\nwarrant and were not otherwise justified by exigent cir-\r\ncumstances. The trial court rejected that argument. App.\r\nin No. 13–132, at 24, 26. At Riley’s trial, police officers\r\ntestified about the photographs and videos found on the\r\nphone, and some of the photographs were admitted into\r\nevidence. Riley was convicted on all three counts and\r\nreceived an enhanced sentence of 15 years to life in prison.\r\n  The California Court of Appeal affirmed. No. D059840\r\n(Cal. App., Feb. 8, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13–\r\n132, pp. 1a–23a. The court relied on the California Su-\r\npreme Court’s decision in People v. Diaz, 51 Cal. 4th 84,\r\n244 P. 3d 501 (2011), which held that the Fourth Amend-\r\nment permits a warrantless search of cell phone data\r\nincident to an arrest, so long as the cell phone was imme-\r\ndiately associated with the arrestee’s person. See id., at\r\n93, 244 P. 3d, at 505–506.\r\n  The California Supreme Court denied Riley’s petition for\r\nreview, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13–132, at 24a, and we\r\ngranted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\r\n                             B\r\n  In the second case, a police officer performing routine\r\nsurveillance observed respondent Brima Wurie make an\r\napparent drug sale from a car. Officers subsequently\r\narrested Wurie and took him to the police station. At the\r\nstation, the officers seized two cell phones from Wurie’s\r\nperson. The one at issue here was a “flip phone,” a kind of\r\nphone that is flipped open for use and that generally has a\r\nsmaller range of features than a smart phone. Five to ten\r\nminutes after arriving at the station, the officers noticed\r\nthat the phone was repeatedly receiving calls from a\r\n4                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsource identified as “my house” on the phone’s external\r\nscreen. A few minutes later, they opened the phone and\r\nsaw a photograph of a woman and a baby set as the\r\nphone’s wallpaper. They pressed one button on the phone\r\nto access its call log, then another button to determine the\r\nphone number associated with the “my house” label. They\r\nnext used an online phone directory to trace that phone\r\nnumber to an apartment building.\r\n   When the officers went to the building, they saw Wurie’s\r\nname on a mailbox and observed through a window a\r\nwoman who resembled the woman in the photograph on\r\nWurie’s phone. They secured the apartment while obtain-\r\ning a search warrant and, upon later executing the war-\r\nrant, found and seized 215 grams of crack cocaine, mari-\r\njuana, drug paraphernalia, a firearm and ammunition, and\r\ncash.\r\n   Wurie was charged with distributing crack cocaine,\r\npossessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and\r\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\r\nSee 18 U. S. C. §922(g); 21 U. S. C. §841(a). He moved to\r\nsuppress the evidence obtained from the search of the\r\napartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an unconstitu-\r\ntional search of his cell phone. The District Court denied\r\nthe motion. 612 F. Supp. 2d 104 (Mass. 2009). Wurie was\r\nconvicted on all three counts and sentenced to 262 months\r\nin prison.\r\n   A divided panel of the First Circuit reversed the denial\r\nof Wurie’s motion to suppress and vacated Wurie’s convic-\r\ntions for possession with intent to distribute and posses-\r\nsion of a firearm as a felon. 728 F. 3d 1 (2013). The court\r\nheld that cell phones are distinct from other physical\r\npossessions that may be searched incident to arrest with-\r\nout a warrant, because of the amount of personal data cell\r\nphones contain and the negligible threat they pose to law\r\nenforcement interests.

S. 398, 403 (2006). Our cases have deter-\r\nmined that “[w]here a search is undertaken by law en-\r\nforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrong-\r\ndoing, . . . reasonableness generally requires the obtaining\r\nof a judicial warrant.” Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,\r\n515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995). Such a warrant ensures that\r\nthe inferences to support a search are “drawn by a neutral\r\nand detached magistrate instead of being judged by the\r\nofficer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of\r\nferreting out crime.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.\r\n10, 14 (1948). In the absence of a warrant, a search is\r\nreasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the\r\nwarrant requirement. See Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.\r\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6).\r\n   The two cases before us concern the reasonableness of a\r\nwarrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In 1914,\r\nthis Court first acknowledged in dictum “the right on the\r\npart of the Government, always recognized under English\r\nand American law, to search the person of the accused\r\nwhen legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or\r\nevidences of crime.” Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383,\r\n392. Since that time, it has been well accepted that such a\r\nsearch constitutes an exception to the warrant require-\r\nment. Indeed, the label “exception” is something of a\r\n6                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmisnomer in this context, as warrantless searches incident\r\nto arrest occur with far greater frequency than searches\r\nconducted pursuant to a warrant. See 3 W. LaFave,\r\nSearch and Seizure §5.2(b), p. 132, and n. 15 (5th ed.\r\n2012).\r\n  Although the existence of the exception for such searches\r\nhas been recognized for a century, its scope has been de-\r\nbated for nearly as long. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S.\r\n332, 350 (2009) (noting the exception’s “checkered his-\r\ntory”). That debate has focused on the extent to which\r\nofficers may search property found on or near the arrestee.\r\nThree related precedents set forth the rules governing\r\nsuch searches:\r\n  The first, Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), laid\r\nthe groundwork for most of the existing search incident to\r\narrest doctrine. Police officers in that case arrested\r\nChimel inside his home and proceeded to search his entire\r\nthree-bedroom house, including the attic and garage. In\r\nparticular rooms, they also looked through the contents of\r\ndrawers. Id., at 753–754.\r\n   The Court crafted the following rule for assessing the\r\nreasonableness of a search incident to arrest:\r\n    “When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the ar-\r\n    resting officer to search the person arrested in order\r\n    to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to\r\n    use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Oth-\r\n    erwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered,\r\n    and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is en-\r\n    tirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for\r\n    and seize any evidence on the arrestee’s person in or-\r\n    der to prevent its concealment or destruction. . . .\r\n    There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of\r\n    the arrestee’s person and the area ‘within his immedi-\r\n    ate control’—construing that phrase to mean the area\r\n    from within which he might gain possession of a\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    weapon or destructible evidence.” Id., at 762–763.\r\nThe extensive warrantless search of Chimel’s home did not\r\nfit within this exception, because it was not needed to\r\nprotect officer safety or to preserve evidence. Id., at 763,\r\n768.\r\n   Four years later, in United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S.\r\n218 (1973), the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the\r\ncontext of a search of the arrestee’s person. A police of-\r\nficer had arrested Robinson for driving with a revoked\r\nlicense. The officer conducted a patdown search and felt\r\nan object that he could not identify in Robinson’s coat\r\npocket. He removed the object, which turned out to be a\r\ncrumpled cigarette package, and opened it. Inside were 14\r\ncapsules of heroin. Id., at 220, 223.\r\n   The Court of Appeals concluded that the search was\r\nunreasonable because Robinson was unlikely to have\r\nevidence of the crime of arrest on his person, and because\r\nit believed that extracting the cigarette package and open-\r\ning it could not be justified as part of a protective search\r\nfor weapons. This Court reversed, rejecting the notion\r\nthat “case-by-case adjudication” was required to determine\r\n“whether or not there was present one of the reasons\r\nsupporting the authority for a search of the person inci-\r\ndent to a lawful arrest.” Id., at 235. As the Court ex-\r\nplained, “[t]he authority to search the person incident to a\r\nlawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to\r\ndisarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what\r\na court may later decide was the probability in a particu-\r\nlar arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact\r\nbe found upon the person of the suspect.” Ibid. Instead, a\r\n“custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a\r\nreasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that\r\nintrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest\r\nrequires no additional justification.” Ibid.\r\n   The Court thus concluded that the search of Robinson\r\n8                    RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwas reasonable even though there was no concern about\r\nthe loss of evidence, and the arresting officer had no spe-\r\ncific concern that Robinson might be armed. Id., at 236.\r\nIn doing so, the Court did not draw a line between a\r\nsearch of Robinson’s person and a further examination of\r\nthe cigarette pack found during that search. It merely\r\nnoted that, “[h]aving in the course of a lawful search come\r\nupon the crumpled package of cigarettes, [the officer] was\r\nentitled to inspect it.” Ibid. A few years later, the Court\r\nclarified that this exception was limited to “personal prop-\r\nerty . . . immediately associated with the person of the\r\narrestee.” United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 15\r\n(1977) (200-pound, locked footlocker could not be searched\r\nincident to arrest), abrogated on other grounds by Califor-\r\nnia v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565 (1991).\r\n   The search incident to arrest trilogy concludes with\r\nGant, which analyzed searches of an arrestee’s vehicle.\r\nGant, like Robinson, recognized that the Chimel concerns\r\nfor officer safety and evidence preservation underlie the\r\nsearch incident to arrest exception. See 556 U. S., at 338.\r\nAs a result, the Court concluded that Chimel could author-\r\nize police to search a vehicle “only when the arrestee is\r\nunsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger\r\ncompartment at the time of the search.” 556 U. S., at 343.\r\nGant added, however, an independent exception for a\r\nwarrantless search of a vehicle’s passenger compartment\r\n“when it is ‘reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the\r\ncrime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.’ ” Ibid.\r\n(quoting Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632\r\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). That excep-\r\ntion stems not from Chimel, the Court explained, but from\r\n“circumstances unique to the vehicle context.” 556 U. S.,\r\nat 343.\r\n                              III\r\n    These cases require us to decide how the search incident\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto arrest doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are\r\nnow such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that\r\nthe proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were\r\nan important feature of human anatomy. A smart phone\r\nof the sort taken from Riley was unheard of ten years ago;\r\na significant majority of American adults now own such\r\nphones. See A. Smith, Pew Research Center, Smartphone\r\nOwnership—2013 Update (June 5, 2013). Even less so-\r\nphisticated phones like Wurie’s, which have already faded\r\nin popularity since Wurie was arrested in 2007, have been\r\naround for less than 15 years. Both phones are based on\r\ntechnology nearly inconceivable just a few decades ago,\r\nwhen Chimel and Robinson were decided.\r\n   Absent more precise guidance from the founding era, we\r\ngenerally determine whether to exempt a given type of\r\nsearch from the warrant requirement “by assessing, on the\r\none hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individ-\r\nual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is\r\nneeded for the promotion of legitimate governmental\r\ninterests.” Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300\r\n(1999). Such a balancing of interests supported the search\r\nincident to arrest exception in Robinson, and a mechanical\r\napplication of Robinson might well support the warrant-\r\nless searches at issue here.\r\n   But while Robinson’s categorical rule strikes the appro-\r\npriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of\r\nits rationales has much force with respect to digital con-\r\ntent on cell phones. On the government interest side,\r\nRobinson concluded that the two risks identified in\r\nChimel—harm to officers and destruction of evidence—are\r\npresent in all custodial arrests. There are no comparable\r\nrisks when the search is of digital data. In addition, Rob-\r\ninson regarded any privacy interests retained by an indi-\r\nvidual after arrest as significantly diminished by the fact\r\nof the arrest itself. Cell phones, however, place vast quan-\r\ntities of personal information literally in the hands of\r\n10                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nindividuals. A search of the information on a cell phone\r\nbears little resemblance to the type of brief physical search\r\nconsidered in Robinson.\r\n  We therefore decline to extend Robinson to searches of\r\ndata on cell phones, and hold instead that officers must\r\ngenerally secure a warrant before conducting such a\r\nsearch.\r\n                               A\r\n   We first consider each Chimel concern in turn. In doing\r\nso, we do not overlook Robinson’s admonition that searches\r\nof a person incident to arrest, “while based upon the\r\nneed to disarm and to discover evidence,” are reasonable\r\nregardless of “the probability in a particular arrest situa-\r\ntion that weapons or evidence would in fact be found.” 414\r\nU. S., at 235. Rather than requiring the “case-by-case\r\nadjudication” that Robinson rejected, ibid., we ask instead\r\nwhether application of the search incident to arrest doc-\r\ntrine to this particular category of effects would “untether\r\nthe rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel\r\nexception,” Gant, supra, at 343. See also Knowles v. Iowa,\r\n525 U. S. 113, 119 (1998) (declining to extend Robinson to\r\nthe issuance of citations, “a situation where the concern\r\nfor officer safety is not present to the same extent and the\r\nconcern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at\r\nall”).\r\n                              1\r\n   Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used\r\nas a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate\r\nthe arrestee’s escape. Law enforcement officers remain\r\nfree to examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure\r\nthat it will not be used as a weapon—say, to determine\r\nwhether there is a razor blade hidden between the phone\r\nand its case. Once an officer has secured a phone and\r\neliminated any potential physical threats, however, data\r\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\non the phone can endanger no one.\r\n   Perhaps the same might have been said of the cigarette\r\npack seized from Robinson’s pocket. Once an officer\r\ngained control of the pack, it was unlikely that Robinson\r\ncould have accessed the pack’s contents. But unknown\r\nphysical objects may always pose risks, no matter how\r\nslight, during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest.\r\nThe officer in Robinson testified that he could not identify\r\nthe objects in the cigarette pack but knew they were not\r\ncigarettes. See 414 U. S., at 223, 236, n. 7. Given that, a\r\nfurther search was a reasonable protective measure. No\r\nsuch unknowns exist with respect to digital data. As the\r\nFirst Circuit explained, the officers who searched Wurie’s\r\ncell phone “knew exactly what they would find therein:\r\ndata. They also knew that the data could not harm them.”\r\n728 F. 3d, at 10.\r\n   The United States and California both suggest that a\r\nsearch of cell phone data might help ensure officer safety\r\nin more indirect ways, for example by alerting officers that\r\nconfederates of the arrestee are headed to the scene.\r\nThere is undoubtedly a strong government interest in\r\nwarning officers about such possibilities, but neither the\r\nUnited States nor California offers evidence to suggest\r\nthat their concerns are based on actual experience. The\r\nproposed consideration would also represent a broadening\r\nof Chimel’s concern that an arrestee himself might grab a\r\nweapon and use it against an officer “to resist arrest or\r\neffect his escape.” 395 U. S., at 763. And any such threats\r\nfrom outside the arrest scene do not “lurk[ ] in all custodial\r\narrests.” Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 14–15. Accordingly, the\r\ninterest in protecting officer safety does not justify dis-\r\npensing with the warrant requirement across the board.\r\nTo the extent dangers to arresting officers may be impli-\r\ncated in a particular way in a particular case, they are\r\nbetter addressed through consideration of case-specific\r\nexceptions to the warrant requirement, such as the one for\r\n12                 RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden, Md. Peniten-\r\ntiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299 (1967) (“The\r\nFourth Amendment does not require police officers to\r\ndelay in the course of an investigation if to do so would\r\ngravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.”).\r\n                              2\r\n   The United States and California focus primarily on the\r\nsecond Chimel rationale: preventing the destruction of\r\nevidence.\r\n   Both Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have\r\nseized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction\r\nof evidence while seeking a warrant. See Brief for Peti-\r\ntioner in No. 13–132, p. 20; Brief for Respondent in No.\r\n13–212, p. 41. That is a sensible concession. See Illinois\r\nv. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333 (2001); Chadwick,\r\nsupra, at 13, and n. 8. And once law enforcement officers\r\nhave secured a cell phone, there is no longer any risk that\r\nthe arrestee himself will be able to delete incriminating\r\ndata from the phone.\r\n   The United States and California argue that infor-\r\nmation on a cell phone may nevertheless be vulnerable to\r\ntwo types of evidence destruction unique to digital data—\r\nremote wiping and data encryption. Remote wiping occurs\r\nwhen a phone, connected to a wireless network, receives a\r\nsignal that erases stored data. This can happen when a\r\nthird party sends a remote signal or when a phone is\r\npreprogrammed to delete data upon entering or leaving\r\ncertain geographic areas (so-called “geofencing”). See\r\nDept. of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and\r\nTechnology, R. Ayers, S. Brothers, & W. Jansen, Guide-\r\nlines on Mobile Device Forensics (Draft) 29, 31 (SP 800–\r\n101 Rev. 1, Sept. 2013) (hereinafter Ayers). Encryption is\r\na security feature that some modern cell phones use in\r\naddition to password protection. When such phones lock,\r\ndata becomes protected by sophisticated encryption that\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrenders a phone all but “unbreakable” unless police know\r\nthe password. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\r\nNo. 13–132, p. 11.\r\n   As an initial matter, these broader concerns about the\r\nloss of evidence are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a\r\ndefendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or\r\ndestroy evidence within his reach. See 395 U. S., at 763–\r\n764. With respect to remote wiping, the Government’s\r\nprimary concern turns on the actions of third parties who\r\nare not present at the scene of arrest. And data encryp-\r\ntion is even further afield. There, the Government focuses\r\non the ordinary operation of a phone’s security features,\r\napart from any active attempt by a defendant or his asso-\r\nciates to conceal or destroy evidence upon arrest.\r\n   We have also been given little reason to believe that\r\neither problem is prevalent. The briefing reveals only a\r\ncouple of anecdotal examples of remote wiping triggered\r\nby an arrest. See Brief for Association of State Criminal\r\nInvestigative Agencies et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 13–\r\n132, pp. 9–10; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132,\r\np. 48. Similarly, the opportunities for officers to search a\r\npassword-protected phone before data becomes encrypted\r\nare quite limited. Law enforcement officers are very\r\nunlikely to come upon such a phone in an unlocked state\r\nbecause most phones lock at the touch of a button or, as a\r\ndefault, after some very short period of inactivity. See,\r\ne.g., iPhone User Guide for iOS 7.1 Software 10 (2014)\r\n(default lock after about one minute). This may explain\r\nwhy the encryption argument was not made until the\r\nmerits stage in this Court, and has never been considered\r\nby the Courts of Appeals.\r\n   Moreover, in situations in which an arrest might trigger\r\na remote-wipe attempt or an officer discovers an unlocked\r\nphone, it is not clear that the ability to conduct a warrant-\r\nless search would make much of a difference. The need to\r\neffect the arrest, secure the scene, and tend to other press-\r\n14                 RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning matters means that law enforcement officers may well\r\nnot be able to turn their attention to a cell phone right\r\naway. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50; see also\r\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–132, at\r\n19. Cell phone data would be vulnerable to remote wiping\r\nfrom the time an individual anticipates arrest to the time\r\nany eventual search of the phone is completed, which\r\nmight be at the station house hours later. Likewise, an\r\nofficer who seizes a phone in an unlocked state might not\r\nbe able to begin his search in the short time remaining\r\nbefore the phone locks and data becomes encrypted.\r\n   In any event, as to remote wiping, law enforcement is\r\nnot without specific means to address the threat. Remote\r\nwiping can be fully prevented by disconnecting a phone\r\nfrom the network. There are at least two simple ways to\r\ndo this: First, law enforcement officers can turn the phone\r\noff or remove its battery. Second, if they are concerned\r\nabout encryption or other potential problems, they can\r\nleave a phone powered on and place it in an enclosure that\r\nisolates the phone from radio waves. See Ayers 30–31.\r\nSuch devices are commonly called “Faraday bags,” after\r\nthe English scientist Michael Faraday. They are essen-\r\ntially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil: cheap, light-\r\nweight, and easy to use. See Brief for Criminal Law Pro-\r\nfessors as Amici Curiae 9. They may not be a complete\r\nanswer to the problem, see Ayers 32, but at least for now\r\nthey provide a reasonable response. In fact, a number of\r\nlaw enforcement agencies around the country already\r\nencourage the use of Faraday bags. See, e.g., Dept. of\r\nJustice, National Institute of Justice, Electronic Crime\r\nScene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders 14, 32\r\n(2d ed. Apr. 2008); Brief for Criminal Law Professors as\r\nAmici Curiae 4–6.\r\n   To the extent that law enforcement still has specific\r\nconcerns about the potential loss of evidence in a particu-\r\nlar case, there remain more targeted ways to address\r\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

If “the police are truly confronted with a\r\n‘now or never’ situation,”—for example, circumstances\r\nsuggesting that a defendant’s phone will be the target of\r\nan imminent remote-wipe attempt—they may be able to\r\nrely on exigent circumstances to search the phone imme-\r\ndiately. Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\r\n(slip op., at 10) (quoting Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S.\r\n496, 505 (1973); some internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nOr, if officers happen to seize a phone in an unlocked\r\nstate, they may be able to disable a phone’s automatic-lock\r\nfeature in order to prevent the phone from locking and\r\nencrypting data. See App. to Reply Brief in No. 13–132, p.\r\n3a (diagramming the few necessary steps). Such a preven-\r\ntive measure could be analyzed under the principles set\r\nforth in our decision in McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, which\r\napproved officers’ reasonable steps to secure a scene to\r\npreserve evidence while they awaited a warrant. See id.,\r\nat 331–333.\r\n                              B\r\n   The search incident to arrest exception rests not only on\r\nthe heightened government interests at stake in a volatile\r\narrest situation, but also on an arrestee’s reduced privacy\r\ninterests upon being taken into police custody. Robinson\r\nfocused primarily on the first of those rationales. But it\r\nalso quoted with approval then-Judge Cardozo’s account of\r\nthe historical basis for the search incident to arrest excep-\r\ntion: “Search of the person becomes lawful when grounds\r\nfor arrest and accusation have been discovered, and the\r\nlaw is in the act of subjecting the body of the accused to its\r\nphysical dominion.” 414 U. S., at 232 (quoting People v.\r\nChiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923));\r\nsee also 414 U. S., at 237 (Powell, J., concurring) (“an\r\nindividual lawfully subjected to a custodial arrest retains\r\nno significant Fourth Amendment interest in the privacy\r\nof his person”). Put simply, a patdown of Robinson’s cloth-\r\n16                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning and an inspection of the cigarette pack found in his\r\npocket constituted only minor additional intrusions com-\r\npared to the substantial government authority exercised\r\nin taking Robinson into custody. See Chadwick, 433 U. S.,\r\nat 16, n. 10 (searches of a person are justified in part by\r\n“reduced expectations of privacy caused by the arrest”).\r\n   The fact that an arrestee has diminished privacy inter-\r\nests does not mean that the Fourth Amendment falls out\r\nof the picture entirely. Not every search “is acceptable\r\nsolely because a person is in custody.” Maryland v. King,\r\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). To the contrary,\r\nwhen “privacy-related concerns are weighty enough” a\r\n“search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the di-\r\nminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.” Ibid.\r\nOne such example, of course, is Chimel. Chimel refused to\r\n“characteriz[e] the invasion of privacy that results from a\r\ntop-to-bottom search of a man’s house as ‘minor.’ ” 395\r\nU. S., at 766–767, n. 12. Because a search of the arrestee’s\r\nentire house was a substantial invasion beyond the arrest\r\nitself, the Court concluded that a warrant was required.\r\n   Robinson is the only decision from this Court applying\r\nChimel to a search of the contents of an item found on an\r\narrestee’s person. In an earlier case, this Court had ap-\r\nproved a search of a zipper bag carried by an arrestee, but\r\nthe Court analyzed only the validity of the arrest itself.\r\nSee Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307, 310–311\r\n(1959). Lower courts applying Robinson and Chimel,\r\nhowever, have approved searches of a variety of personal\r\nitems carried by an arrestee. See, e.g., United States v.\r\nCarrion, 809 F. 2d 1120, 1123, 1128 (CA5 1987) (billfold\r\nand address book); United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d\r\n1374, 1383–1384 (CA11 1982) (wallet); United States v.\r\nLee, 501 F. 2d 890, 892 (CADC 1974) (purse).\r\n   The United States asserts that a search of all data\r\nstored on a cell phone is “materially indistinguishable”\r\nfrom searches of these sorts of physical items. Brief for\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nUnited States in No. 13–212, p. 26. That is like saying a\r\nride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a\r\nflight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A\r\nto point B, but little else justifies lumping them together.\r\nModern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy con-\r\ncerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a ciga-\r\nrette pack, a wallet, or a purse. A conclusion that inspect-\r\ning the contents of an arrestee’s pockets works no\r\nsubstantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the\r\narrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items,\r\nbut any extension of that reasoning to digital data has to\r\nrest on its own bottom.\r\n                               1\r\n   Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualita-\r\ntive sense from other objects that might be kept on an\r\narrestee’s person. The term “cell phone” is itself mislead-\r\ning shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicom-\r\nputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as\r\na telephone. They could just as easily be called cameras,\r\nvideo players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, librar-\r\nies, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.\r\n   One of the most notable distinguishing features of mod-\r\nern cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before\r\ncell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical\r\nrealities and tended as a general matter to constitute only\r\na narrow intrusion on privacy. See Kerr, Foreword: Ac-\r\ncounting for Technological Change, 36 Harv. J. L. & Pub.\r\nPol’y 403, 404–405 (2013). Most people cannot lug around\r\nevery piece of mail they have received for the past several\r\nmonths, every picture they have taken, or every book or\r\narticle they have read—nor would they have any reason to\r\nattempt to do so. And if they did, they would have to drag\r\nbehind them a trunk of the sort held to require a search\r\nwarrant in Chadwick, supra, rather than a container the\r\nsize of the cigarette package in Robinson.\r\n18                    RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   But the possible intrusion on privacy is not physically\r\nlimited in the same way when it comes to cell phones. The\r\ncurrent top-selling smart phone has a standard capacity of\r\n16 gigabytes (and is available with up to 64 gigabytes).\r\nSixteen gigabytes translates to millions of pages of text,\r\nthousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos. See Kerr,\r\nsupra, at 404; Brief for Center for Democracy & Technol-\r\nogy et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8. Cell phones couple that\r\ncapacity with the ability to store many different types of\r\ninformation: Even the most basic phones that sell for less\r\nthan $20 might hold photographs, picture messages, text\r\nmessages, Internet browsing history, a calendar, a thousand-\r\nentry phone book, and so on. See id., at 30; United States\r\nv. Flores-Lopez, 670 F. 3d 803, 806 (CA7 2012). We expect\r\nthat the gulf between physical practicability and digital\r\ncapacity will only continue to widen in the future.\r\n   The storage capacity of cell phones has several interre-\r\nlated consequences for privacy. First, a cell phone collects\r\nin one place many distinct types of information—an ad-\r\ndress, a note, a prescription, a bank statement, a video—\r\nthat reveal much more in combination than any isolated\r\nrecord. Second, a cell phone’s capacity allows even just\r\none type of information to convey far more than previously\r\npossible. The sum of an individual’s private life can be\r\nreconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled\r\nwith dates, locations, and descriptions; the same cannot be\r\nsaid of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked into a\r\nwallet. Third, the data on a phone can date back to the\r\npurchase of the phone, or even earlier. A person might\r\ncarry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding him to call\r\nMr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his communi-\r\ncations with Mr. Jones for the past several months, as\r\nwould routinely be kept on a phone.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 Because the United States and California agree that these cases\r\n\r\ninvolve searches incident to arrest, these cases do not implicate the\r\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                19\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Finally, there is an element of pervasiveness that char-\r\nacterizes cell phones but not physical records. Prior to the\r\ndigital age, people did not typically carry a cache of sensi-\r\ntive personal information with them as they went about\r\ntheir day. Now it is the person who is not carrying a cell\r\nphone, with all that it contains, who is the exception.\r\nAccording to one poll, nearly three-quarters of smart\r\nphone users report being within five feet of their phones\r\nmost of the time, with 12% admitting that they even use\r\ntheir phones in the shower. See Harris Interactive, 2013\r\nMobile Consumer Habits Study (June 2013). A decade ago\r\npolice officers searching an arrestee might have occasion-\r\nally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a\r\ndiary. See, e.g., United States v. Frankenberry, 387 F. 2d\r\n337 (CA2 1967) (per curiam). But those discoveries were\r\nlikely to be few and far between. Today, by contrast, it is\r\nno exaggeration to say that many of the more than 90% of\r\nAmerican adults who own a cell phone keep on their per-\r\nson a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—\r\nfrom the mundane to the intimate. See Ontario v. Quon,\r\n560 U. S. 746, 760 (2010). Allowing the police to scrutinize\r\nsuch records on a routine basis is quite different from\r\nallowing them to search a personal item or two in the\r\noccasional case.\r\n   Although the data stored on a cell phone is distin-\r\nguished from physical records by quantity alone, certain\r\ntypes of data are also qualitatively different. An Internet\r\nsearch and browsing history, for example, can be found on\r\nan Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individu-\r\nal’s private interests or concerns—perhaps a search for\r\ncertain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits\r\nto WebMD. Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a\r\nperson has been. Historic location information is a stand-\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nquestion whether the collection or inspection of aggregated digital\r\n\r\ninformation amounts to a search under other circumstances.\r\n\r\n20                 RILEY v.

S. ___, ___ (2012)\r\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (“GPS monitor-\r\ning generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person’s\r\npublic movements that reflects a wealth of detail about\r\nher familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual\r\nassociations.”).\r\n  Mobile application software on a cell phone, or “apps,”\r\noffer a range of tools for managing detailed information\r\nabout all aspects of a person’s life. There are apps for\r\nDemocratic Party news and Republican Party news; apps\r\nfor alcohol, drug, and gambling addictions; apps for shar-\r\ning prayer requests; apps for tracking pregnancy symp-\r\ntoms; apps for planning your budget; apps for every con-\r\nceivable hobby or pastime; apps for improving your\r\nromantic life. There are popular apps for buying or selling\r\njust about anything, and the records of such transactions\r\nmay be accessible on the phone indefinitely. There are\r\nover a million apps available in each of the two major app\r\nstores; the phrase “there’s an app for that” is now part of\r\nthe popular lexicon. The average smart phone user has\r\ninstalled 33 apps, which together can form a revealing\r\nmontage of the user’s life. See Brief for Electronic Privacy\r\nInformation Center as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–132, p. 9.\r\n  In 1926, Learned Hand observed (in an opinion later\r\nquoted in Chimel) that it is “a totally different thing to\r\nsearch a man’s pockets and use against him what they\r\ncontain, from ransacking his house for everything which\r\nmay incriminate him.” United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16\r\nF. 2d 202, 203 (CA2). If his pockets contain a cell phone,\r\nhowever, that is no longer true. Indeed, a cell phone\r\nsearch would typically expose to the government far more\r\nthan the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not\r\nonly contains in digital form many sensitive records previ-\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

See New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460,\r\nn. 4 (1981) (describing a “container” as “any object capable\r\nof holding another object”). But the analogy crumbles\r\nentirely when a cell phone is used to access data located\r\nelsewhere, at the tap of a screen. That is what cell\r\nphones, with increasing frequency, are designed to do by\r\ntaking advantage of “cloud computing.” Cloud computing\r\nis the capacity of Internet-connected devices to display\r\ndata stored on remote servers rather than on the device\r\nitself. Cell phone users often may not know whether\r\nparticular information is stored on the device or in the\r\ncloud, and it generally makes little difference. See Brief\r\nfor Electronic Privacy Information Center in No. 13–132,\r\nat 12–14, 20. Moreover, the same type of data may be\r\nstored locally on the device for one user and in the cloud\r\nfor another.\r\n   The United States concedes that the search incident to\r\narrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of\r\nfiles accessed remotely—that is, a search of files stored in\r\nthe cloud. See Brief for United States in No. 13–212, at\r\n43–44. Such a search would be like finding a key in a\r\nsuspect’s pocket and arguing that it allowed law enforce-\r\nment to unlock and search a house. But officers searching\r\na phone’s data would not typically know whether the\r\ninformation they are viewing was stored locally at the\r\ntime of the arrest or has been pulled from the cloud.\r\n22                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  Although the Government recognizes the problem, its\r\nproposed solutions are unclear. It suggests that officers\r\ncould disconnect a phone from the network before search-\r\ning the device—the very solution whose feasibility it con-\r\ntested with respect to the threat of remote wiping. Com-\r\npare Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50–51, with Tr. of\r\nOral Arg. in No. 13–212, pp. 13–14. Alternatively, the\r\nGovernment proposes that law enforcement agencies\r\n“develop protocols to address” concerns raised by cloud\r\ncomputing. Reply Brief in No. 13–212, pp. 14–15. Proba-\r\nbly a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution\r\nto gain the right to government agency protocols. The\r\npossibility that a search might extend well beyond papers\r\nand effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee is yet\r\nanother reason that the privacy interests here dwarf those\r\nin Robinson.\r\n                              C\r\n  Apart from their arguments for a direct extension of\r\nRobinson, the United States and California offer various\r\nfallback options for permitting warrantless cell phone\r\nsearches under certain circumstances. Each of the pro-\r\nposals is flawed and contravenes our general preference to\r\nprovide clear guidance to law enforcement through cate-\r\ngorical rules. “[I]f police are to have workable rules, the\r\nbalancing of the competing interests . . . ‘must in large\r\npart be done on a categorical basis—not in an ad hoc, case-\r\nby-case fashion by individual police officers.’ ” Michigan v.\r\nSummers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19 (1981) (quoting Duna-\r\nway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 219–220 (1979) (White, J.,\r\nconcurring)).\r\n  The United States first proposes that the Gant standard\r\nbe imported from the vehicle context, allowing a warrant-\r\nless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is rea-\r\nsonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the\r\ncrime of arrest. But Gant relied on “circumstances unique\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto the vehicle context” to endorse a search solely for the\r\npurpose of gathering evidence. 556 U. S., at 343. JUSTICE\r\nSCALIA’s Thornton opinion, on which Gant was based,\r\nexplained that those unique circumstances are “a reduced\r\nexpectation of privacy” and “heightened law enforcement\r\nneeds” when it comes to motor vehicles. 541 U. S., at 631;\r\nsee also Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S., at 303–304. For\r\nreasons that we have explained, cell phone searches bear\r\nneither of those characteristics.\r\n  At any rate, a Gant standard would prove no practical\r\nlimit at all when it comes to cell phone searches. In the\r\nvehicle context, Gant generally protects against searches\r\nfor evidence of past crimes. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and\r\nSeizure §7.1(d), at 709, and n. 191. In the cell phone\r\ncontext, however, it is reasonable to expect that incrimi-\r\nnating information will be found on a phone regardless of\r\nwhen the crime occurred. Similarly, in the vehicle context\r\nGant restricts broad searches resulting from minor crimes\r\nsuch as traffic violations. See id., §7.1(d), at 713, and n.\r\n204. That would not necessarily be true for cell phones. It\r\nwould be a particularly inexperienced or unimaginative\r\nlaw enforcement officer who could not come up with sev-\r\neral reasons to suppose evidence of just about any crime\r\ncould be found on a cell phone. Even an individual pulled\r\nover for something as basic as speeding might well have\r\nlocational data dispositive of guilt on his phone. An indi-\r\nvidual pulled over for reckless driving might have evi-\r\ndence on the phone that shows whether he was texting\r\nwhile driving. The sources of potential pertinent infor-\r\nmation are virtually unlimited, so applying the Gant\r\nstandard to cell phones would in effect give “police officers\r\nunbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person’s\r\nprivate effects.” 556 U. S., at 345.\r\n  The United States also proposes a rule that would re-\r\nstrict the scope of a cell phone search to those areas of the\r\nphone where an officer reasonably believes that infor-\r\n24                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmation relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or\r\nofficer safety will be discovered. See Brief for United\r\nStates in No. 13–212, at 51–53. This approach would\r\nagain impose few meaningful constraints on officers. The\r\nproposed categories would sweep in a great deal of infor-\r\nmation, and officers would not always be able to discern in\r\nadvance what information would be found where.\r\n  We also reject the United States’ final suggestion that\r\nofficers should always be able to search a phone’s call log,\r\nas they did in Wurie’s case. The Government relies on\r\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979), which held that\r\nno warrant was required to use a pen register at telephone\r\ncompany premises to identify numbers dialed by a particu-\r\nlar caller. The Court in that case, however, concluded that\r\nthe use of a pen register was not a “search” at all under\r\nthe Fourth Amendment. See id., at 745–746. There is no\r\ndispute here that the officers engaged in a search of\r\nWurie’s cell phone. Moreover, call logs typically contain\r\nmore than just phone numbers; they include any identify-\r\ning information that an individual might add, such as the\r\nlabel “my house” in Wurie’s case.\r\n  Finally, at oral argument California suggested a differ-\r\nent limiting principle, under which officers could search\r\ncell phone data if they could have obtained the same in-\r\nformation from a pre-digital counterpart. See Tr. of Oral\r\nArg. in No. 13–132, at 38–43; see also Flores-Lopez, 670\r\nF. 3d, at 807 (“If police are entitled to open a pocket diary\r\nto copy the owner’s address, they should be entitled to\r\nturn on a cell phone to learn its number.”). But the fact\r\nthat a search in the pre-digital era could have turned up a\r\nphotograph or two in a wallet does not justify a search of\r\nthousands of photos in a digital gallery. The fact that\r\nsomeone could have tucked a paper bank statement in a\r\npocket does not justify a search of every bank statement\r\nfrom the last five years. And to make matters worse, such\r\nan analogue test would allow law enforcement to search a\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           25\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrange of items contained on a phone, even though people\r\nwould be unlikely to carry such a variety of information in\r\nphysical form. In Riley’s case, for example, it is implausi-\r\nble that he would have strolled around with video tapes,\r\nphoto albums, and an address book all crammed into his\r\npockets. But because each of those items has a pre-digital\r\nanalogue, police under California’s proposal would be able\r\nto search a phone for all of those items—a significant\r\ndiminution of privacy.\r\n  In addition, an analogue test would launch courts on a\r\ndifficult line-drawing expedition to determine which digi-\r\ntal files are comparable to physical records. Is an e-mail\r\nequivalent to a letter? Is a voicemail equivalent to a\r\nphone message slip? It is not clear how officers could\r\nmake these kinds of decisions before conducting a search,\r\nor how courts would apply the proposed rule after the fact.\r\nAn analogue test would “keep defendants and judges\r\nguessing for years to come.” Sykes v. United States, 564\r\nU. S. 1, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7)\r\n(discussing the Court’s analogue test under the Armed\r\nCareer Criminal Act).\r\n                            IV\r\n  We cannot deny that our decision today will have an\r\nimpact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime.\r\nCell phones have become important tools in facilitating\r\ncoordination and communication among members of crim-\r\ninal enterprises, and can provide valuable incriminating\r\ninformation about dangerous criminals. Privacy comes at\r\na cost.\r\n  Our holding, of course, is not that the information on a\r\ncell phone is immune from search; it is instead that a\r\nwarrant is generally required before such a search, even\r\nwhen a cell phone is seized incident to arrest. Our cases\r\nhave historically recognized that the warrant requirement\r\nis “an important working part of our machinery of gov-\r\n26                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nernment,” not merely “an inconvenience to be somehow\r\n‘weighed’ against the claims of police efficiency.” Coolidge\r\nv. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 481 (1971). Recent\r\ntechnological advances similar to those discussed here\r\nhave, in addition, made the process of obtaining a warrant\r\nitself more efficient. See McNeely, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip\r\nop., at 11–12); id., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in\r\npart and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 8) (describing\r\njurisdiction where “police officers can e-mail warrant\r\nrequests to judges’ iPads [and] judges have signed such\r\nwarrants and e-mailed them back to officers in less than\r\n15 minutes”).\r\n   Moreover, even though the search incident to arrest\r\nexception does not apply to cell phones, other case-specific\r\nexceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a\r\nparticular phone. “One well-recognized exception applies\r\nwhen ‘ “the exigencies of the situation” make the needs of\r\nlaw enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search\r\nis objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.’ ”\r\nKentucky v. King, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting\r\nMincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978)). Such exi-\r\ngencies could include the need to prevent the imminent\r\ndestruction of evidence in individual cases, to pursue a\r\nfleeing suspect, and to assist persons who are seriously\r\ninjured or are threatened with imminent injury. 563\r\nU. S., at ___. In Chadwick, for example, the Court held\r\nthat the exception for searches incident to arrest did not\r\njustify a search of the trunk at issue, but noted that “if\r\nofficers have reason to believe that luggage contains some\r\nimmediately dangerous instrumentality, such as explo-\r\nsives, it would be foolhardy to transport it to the station\r\nhouse without opening the luggage.” 433 U. S., at 15, n. 9.\r\n   In light of the availability of the exigent circumstances\r\nexception, there is no reason to believe that law enforce-\r\nment officers will not be able to address some of the more\r\nextreme hypotheticals that have been suggested: a suspect\r\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

The\r\ndefendants here recognize—indeed, they stress—that such\r\nfact-specific threats may justify a warrantless search of\r\ncell phone data. See Reply Brief in No. 13–132, at 8–9;\r\nBrief for Respondent in No. 13–212, at 30, 41. The critical\r\npoint is that, unlike the search incident to arrest excep-\r\ntion, the exigent circumstances exception requires a court\r\nto examine whether an emergency justified a warrantless\r\nsearch in each particular case. See McNeely, supra, at ___\r\n(slip op., at 6).2\r\n                        *    *    *\r\n   Our cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment\r\nwas the founding generation’s response to the reviled\r\n“general warrants” and “writs of assistance” of the colonial\r\nera, which allowed British officers to rummage through\r\nhomes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal\r\nactivity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the\r\ndriving forces behind the Revolution itself. In 1761, the\r\npatriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston denounc-\r\ning the use of writs of assistance. A young John Adams\r\nwas there, and he would later write that “[e]very man of a\r\ncrowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did,\r\nready to take arms against writs of assistance.” 10 Works\r\nof John Adams 247–248 (C. Adams ed. 1856). According to\r\nAdams, Otis’s speech was “the first scene of the first act of\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  2 In Wurie’s case, for example, the dissenting First Circuit judge ar-\r\ngued that exigent circumstances could have justified a search of Wurie’s\r\nphone. See 728 F. 3d 1, 17 (2013) (opinion of Howard, J.) (discussing\r\nthe repeated unanswered calls from “my house,” the suspected location\r\nof a drug stash). But the majority concluded that the Government had\r\nnot made an exigent circumstances argument. See id., at 1. The\r\nGovernment acknowledges the same in this Court.

With all they contain and all they may\r\nreveal, they hold for many Americans “the privacies of\r\nlife,” Boyd, supra, at 630. The fact that technology now\r\nallows an individual to carry such information in his hand\r\ndoes not make the information any less worthy of the\r\nprotection for which the Founders fought.

I write separately to address\r\ntwo points.\r\n                              I\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n  First, I am not convinced at this time that the ancient\r\nrule on searches incident to arrest is based exclusively (or\r\neven primarily) on the need to protect the safety of arrest-\r\ning officers and the need to prevent the destruction of\r\nevidence. Cf. ante, at 9. This rule antedates the adoption\r\nof the Fourth Amendment by at least a century. See T.\r\nClancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpre-\r\ntation 340 (2008); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional\r\n2                   RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nInterpretation 28 (1969); Amar, Fourth Amendment First\r\nPrinciples, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 764 (1994). In Weeks v.\r\nUnited States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914), we held that the\r\nFourth Amendment did not disturb this rule. See also\r\nTaylor, supra, at 45; Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 105 Yale L. J. 393, 401 (1995) (“The\r\npower to search incident to arrest—a search of the arrested\r\nsuspect’s person . . .—was well established in the mid-\r\neighteenth century, and nothing in . . . the Fourth\r\nAmendment changed that”). And neither in Weeks nor in\r\nany of the authorities discussing the old common-law rule\r\nhave I found any suggestion that it was based exclusively\r\nor primarily on the need to protect arresting officers or to\r\nprevent the destruction of evidence.\r\n  On the contrary, when pre-Weeks authorities discussed\r\nthe basis for the rule, what was mentioned was the need to\r\nobtain probative evidence. For example, an 1839 case\r\nstated that “it is clear, and beyond doubt, that . . . consta-\r\nbles . . . are entitled, upon a lawful arrest by them of one\r\ncharged with treason or felony, to take and detain prop-\r\nerty found in his possession which will form material evi-\r\ndence in his prosecution for that crime.” See Dillon v.\r\nO’Brien, 16 Cox Crim. Cas. 245, 249–251 (1887) (citing\r\nRegina, v. Frost, 9 Car. & P. 129, 173 Eng. Rep. 771)). The\r\ncourt noted that the origins of that rule “deriv[e] from the\r\ninterest which the State has in a person guilty (or reason-\r\nably believed to be guilty) of a crime being brought to\r\njustice, and in a prosecution, once commenced, being\r\ndetermined in due course of law.” 16 Cox Crim. Cas., at\r\n249–250. See also Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527, 537–\r\n540, 42 S. W. 1090, 1093 (1897).\r\n  Two 19th-century treatises that this Court has previ-\r\nously cited in connection with the origin of the search-\r\nincident-to-arrest rule, see Weeks, supra, at 392, suggest\r\nthe same rationale. See F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading\r\nand Practice §60, p. 45 (8th ed. 1880) (“Those arresting a\r\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Bishop, Criminal\r\nProcedure §§210–212, p. 127 (2d ed. 1872) (if an arresting\r\nofficer finds “about the prisoner’s person, or otherwise in\r\nhis possession, either goods or moneys which there is\r\nreason to believe are connected with the supposed crime as\r\nits fruits, or as the instruments with which it was commit-\r\nted, or as directly furnishing evidence relating to the\r\ntransaction, he may take the same, and hold them to be\r\ndisposed of as the court may direct”).\r\n   What ultimately convinces me that the rule is not closely\r\nlinked to the need for officer safety and evidence preser-\r\nvation is that these rationales fail to explain the rule’s\r\nwell-recognized scope. It has long been accepted that\r\nwritten items found on the person of an arrestee may be\r\nexamined and used at trial.* But once these items are\r\n——————\r\n   * Cf. Hill v. California, 401 U.

Nor is there any risk\r\nthat leaving these items unread will endanger the arrest-\r\ning officers.\r\n  The idea that officer safety and the preservation of\r\nevidence are the sole reasons for allowing a warrantless\r\nsearch incident to arrest appears to derive from the\r\nCourt’s reasoning in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752\r\n(1969), a case that involved the lawfulness of a search of\r\nthe scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. As I\r\nhave explained, Chimel’s reasoning is questionable, see\r\nArizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 361–363 (2009) (ALITO, J.,\r\ndissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that rea-\r\nsoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of\r\nthe person of arrestees.\r\n                            B\r\n  Despite my view on the point discussed above, I agree\r\nthat we should not mechanically apply the rule used in the\r\npredigital era to the search of a cell phone. Many cell\r\nphones now in use are capable of storing and accessing a\r\nquantity of information, some highly personal, that no\r\nperson would ever have had on his person in hard-copy\r\nform. This calls for a new balancing of law enforcement\r\nand privacy interests.\r\n  The Court strikes this balance in favor of privacy inter-\r\nests with respect to all cell phones and all information\r\nfound in them, and this approach leads to anomalies. For\r\nexample, the Court’s broad holding favors information in\r\ndigital form over information in hard-copy form. Suppose\r\nthat two suspects are arrested. Suspect number one has\r\nin his pocket a monthly bill for his land-line phone, and\r\n\r\n—————— \r\n\r\nhis surface clothing but his body, luggage, and saddlebags would be\r\n\r\nsearched”). \r\n\r\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nthe bill lists an incriminating call to a long-distance num-\r\nber. He also has in his a wallet a few snapshots, and one\r\nof these is incriminating. Suspect number two has in his\r\npocket a cell phone, the call log of which shows a call to\r\nthe same incriminating number. In addition, a number of\r\nphotos are stored in the memory of the cell phone, and one\r\nof these is incriminating. Under established law, the\r\npolice may seize and examine the phone bill and the snap-\r\nshots in the wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under\r\nthe Court’s holding today, the information stored in the\r\ncell phone is out.\r\n  While the Court’s approach leads to anomalies, I do not\r\nsee a workable alternative. Law enforcement officers need\r\nclear rules regarding searches incident to arrest, and it\r\nwould take many cases and many years for the courts to\r\ndevelop more nuanced rules. And during that time, the\r\nnature of the electronic devices that ordinary Americans\r\ncarry on their persons would continue to change.\r\n                             II\r\n  This brings me to my second point. While I agree with\r\nthe holding of the Court, I would reconsider the question\r\npresented here if either Congress or state legislatures,\r\nafter assessing the legitimate needs of law enforcement\r\nand the privacy interests of cell phone owners, enact legis-\r\nlation that draws reasonable distinctions based on catego-\r\nries of information or perhaps other variables.\r\n  The regulation of electronic surveillance provides an\r\ninstructive example. After this Court held that electronic\r\nsurveillance constitutes a search even when no property\r\ninterest is invaded, see Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.\r\n347, 353–359 (1967), Congress responded by enacting Title\r\nIII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\r\n1968, 82 Stat. 211. See also 18 U. S. C. §2510 et seq.\r\nSince that time, electronic surveillance has been governed\r\nprimarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the stat-\r\n6                  RILEY v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\r\n\r\nute, which authorizes but imposes detailed restrictions on\r\nelectronic surveillance. See ibid.\r\n  Modern cell phones are of great value for both lawful\r\nand unlawful purposes. They can be used in committing\r\nmany serious crimes, and they present new and difficult\r\nlaw enforcement problems. See Brief for United States in\r\nNo. 13–212, pp. 2–3. At the same time, because of the role\r\nthat these devices have come to play in contemporary life,\r\nsearching their contents implicates very sensitive privacy\r\ninterests that this Court is poorly positioned to under-\r\nstand and evaluate. Many forms of modern technology are\r\nmaking it easier and easier for both government and\r\nprivate entities to amass a wealth of information about\r\nthe lives of ordinary Americans, and at the same time,\r\nmany ordinary Americans are choosing to make public\r\nmuch information that was seldom revealed to outsiders\r\njust a few decades ago.\r\n  In light of these developments, it would be very unfor-\r\ntunate if privacy protection in the 21st century were left\r\nprimarily to the federal courts using the blunt instrument\r\nof the Fourth Amendment. Legislatures, elected by the\r\npeople, are in a better position than we are to assess and\r\nrespond to the changes that have already occurred and\r\nthose that almost certainly will take place in the future.\r\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2680439/", "sha1": "3fb6134893038ce4a205e5b4bd7b99c4a939b4a7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-065", "time_retrieved": "2014-06-25T08:01:07.058884"}
