Argued March 25, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014*\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the\n  “Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a person’s exercise of\n  religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicabil-\n  ity” unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the\n  burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling govern-\n  mental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering\n  that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a),\n  (b). As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\n  Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers “any exercise of religion,\n  whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious be-\n  lief.” §2000cc–5(7)(A).\n     At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of\n  Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and\n  Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires\n  specified employers’ group health plans to furnish “preventive care\n  and screenings” for women without “any cost sharing requirements,”\n  42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4). Congress did not specify what types of\n  preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources\n  and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide. Ibid.\n  Nonexempt employers are generally required to provide coverage for\n  the 20 contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Admin-\n\n——————\n   * Together with No. 13–356, Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. et al.\nv.

HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    istration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an\n    already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its\n    attachment to the uterus. Religious employers, such as churches, are\n    exempt from this contraceptive mandate. HHS has also effectively\n    exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections\n    to providing coverage for contraceptive services. Under this accom-\n    modation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage\n    from the employer’s plan and provide plan participants with separate\n    payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-\n    sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its em-\n    ployee beneficiaries.\n       In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corpora-\n    tions have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and\n    that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive\n    drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions,\n    they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively\n    HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin\n    application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them\n    to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.\n    In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their compa-\n    ny—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction. Affirm-\n    ing, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “en-\n    gage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the First Amendment, and\n    that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their\n    personal capacity. In No. 13–354, the Greens, their children, and\n    their companies—Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel—were also denied\n    a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that\n    the Greens’ businesses are “persons” under RFRA, and that the cor-\n    porations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim\n    because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their ex-\n    ercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling inter-\n    est in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the\n    court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the “least\n    restrictive means” of furthering a compelling governmental interest.\nHeld: As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations im-\n posing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA. Pp. 16–49.\n    (a) RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely\n held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mar-\n del. Pp. 16–31.\n      (1) HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are\n for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the\n regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave mer-\n chants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protec-\n tion of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as cor-\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nporations. RFRA’s text shows that Congress designed the statute to\nprovide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend\nto put merchants to such a choice. It employed the familiar legal fic-\ntion of including corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons,”\nbut the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the\nrights of people associated with the corporation, including sharehold-\ners, officers, and employees. Protecting the free-exercise rights of\nclosely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the\nhumans who own and control them. Pp. 16–19.\n     (2) HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments.\nPp. 19–31.\n        (i) Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart\nfrom the Dictionary Act definition of “person,” which “include[s] cor-\nporations, . . . as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1. The Court has\nentertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit cor-\nporations. See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficiente União\ndo Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418. And HHS’s concession that a nonprofit\ncorporation can be a “person” under RFRA effectively dispatches any\nargument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no\nconceivable definition of “person” includes natural persons and non-\nprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations. Pp. 19–20.\n        (ii) HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does\nnot cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot\n“exercise . . . religion.” They offer no persuasive explanation for this\nconclusion. The corporate form alone cannot explain it because\nRFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations. And the profit-\nmaking objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the\nCourt has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who\nwere attempting to make a profit as retail merchants. Braunfeld v.\nBrown, 366 U. S. 599. Business practices compelled or limited by the\ntenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understand-\ning of the “exercise of religion” that this Court set out in Employment\nDiv., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877.\nAny suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercis-\ning religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in\nthe face of modern corporate law. States, including those in which\nthe plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations\nto pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of\nprofit in conformity with the owners’ religious principles. Pp. 20–25.\n        (iii) Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection be-\ncause it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents,\nnone of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit\ncorporations. First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested\nthat its definition of “exercise of religion” was meant to be tied to pre-\n4              BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Smith interpretations of the First Amendment. Second, if RFRA’s\n    original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely\n    dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of\n    the phrase from that in First Amendment case law. Third, the pre-\n    Smith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,\n    366 U. S. 617, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can\n    exercise religion. Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law\n    enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely\n    restored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and re-\n    stricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plain-\n    tiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith. Pp. 25–28.\n          (3) Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted\n    RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of\n    ascertaining the “beliefs” of large, publicly traded corporations, but\n    HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation\n    asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would like-\n    ly prevent that from occurring. HHS has also provided no evidence\n    that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an assert-\n    ed religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations\n    from RFRA’s protection. That disputes among the owners of corpora-\n    tions might arise is not a problem unique to this context. State cor-\n    porate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for\n    example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing\n    structure. Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state\n    law in resolving disputes. Pp. 29–31.\n       (b) HHS’s contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exer-\n    cise of religion. Pp. 31–38.\n          (1) It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that\n    seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at con-\n    ception. If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive\n    coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million\n    per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and\n    $15 million per year for Mardel. And if they drop coverage altogeth-\n    er, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby,\n    $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel. P. 32.\n          (2) Amici supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee\n    penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and\n    therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substan-\n    tial burden imposed by the mandate. HHS has never argued this and\n    the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.\n    But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unper-\n    suasive: It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons\n    for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is\n    far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insur-\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and pay-\ning the ACA penalty. Pp. 32–35.\n      (3) HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting\nparties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too\nattenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage\nand contraceptive method she uses. But RFRA’s question is whether\nthe mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties’\nability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.\nThe belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and im-\nportant question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the cir-\ncumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act\nthat is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facili-\ntating the commission of an immoral act by another. It is not for the\nCourt to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or\nunreasonable. In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly\nidentical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment\nSecurity Div., 450 U. S. 707. The Court’s “narrow function . . . is to\ndetermine” whether the plaintiffs’ asserted religious belief reflects\n“an honest conviction,” id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it\ndoes. Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 689; and Board of Ed. of\nCentral School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 248–249, distin-\nguished. Pp. 35–38.\n   (c) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free\naccess to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling\ngovernmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that\nthe contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering\nthat interest. Pp. 38–49.\n      (1) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free\naccess to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling\nwithin the meaning of RFRA. Pp. 39–40.\n      (2) The Government has failed to satisfy RFRA’s least-\nrestrictive-means standard. HHS has not shown that it lacks other\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion. The Government could, e.g., as-\nsume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable\nto obtain coverage due to their employers’ religious objections. Or it\ncould extend the accommodation that HHS has already established\nfor religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with re-\nligious objections to the contraceptive mandate. That accommodation\ndoes not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that providing in-\nsurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their\nreligion and it still serves HHS’s stated interests. Pp. 40–45.\n      (3) This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and\nshould not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage man-\n6             BURWELL v.

Nor does it\n    provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination\n    as a religious practice. United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, which up-\n    held the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employer’s reli-\n    gious objection, is not analogous. It turned primarily on the special\n    problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee\n    were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is\n    no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay\n    taxes. Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.\n    Pp. 45–49.\nNo. 13–354, 723 F. 3d 1114, affirmed; No. 13–356, 724 F. 3d 377, re-\n versed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §2000bb et seq., permits the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to\ndemand that three closely held corporations provide\nhealth-insurance coverage for methods of contraception\nthat violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the\ncompanies’ owners. We hold that the regulations that\nimpose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the\n2         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal Government from taking any action that substan-\ntially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compel-\nling government interest.\n   In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject\nHHS’s argument that the owners of the companies for-\nfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize\ntheir businesses as corporations rather than sole proprie-\ntorships or general partnerships. The plain terms of\nRFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not dis-\ncriminate in this way against men and women who wish to\nrun their businesses as for-profit corporations in the man-\nner required by their religious beliefs.\n   Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide\nwhether the challenged HHS regulations substantially\nburden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do.\nThe owners of the businesses have religious objections to\nabortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four\ncontraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the\nowners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they\nwill be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply,\nthey will pay a very heavy price—as much as $1.3 million\nper day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one\nof the companies. If these consequences do not amount to\na substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.\n   Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise must serve a\ncompelling government interest, and we assume that the\nHHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order\nfor the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also consti-\ntute the least restrictive means of serving that interest,\nand the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other\nways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that\nevery woman has cost-free access to the particular contra-\nceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a\nsystem that seeks to respect the religious liberty of reli-\ngious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the em-\nployees of these entities have precisely the same access to\nall FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of compa-\nnies whose owners have no religious objections to provid-\ning such coverage. The employees of these religious non-\nprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage\nwithout cost sharing for all FDA-approved contracep-\ntives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net\neconomic burden on the insurance companies that are\nrequired to provide or secure the coverage.\n   Although HHS has made this system available to reli-\ngious nonprofits that have religious objections to the con-\ntraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the\nsame system cannot be made available when the owners of\nfor-profit corporations have similar religious objections.\nWe therefore conclude that this system constitutes an\nalternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims\nwhile providing greater respect for religious liberty. And\nunder RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of\nthe HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting\nparties in these cases is unlawful.\n   As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding\nis very specific. We do not hold, as the principal dissent\nalleges, that for-profit corporations and other commercial\nenterprises can “opt out of any law (saving only tax laws)\nthey judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs.” Post, at 1 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Nor do we\nhold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have\nfree rein to take steps that impose “disadvantages . . . on\nothers” or that require “the general public [to] pick up the\ntab.” Post, at 1–2. And we certainly do not hold or suggest\nthat “RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corpo-\nration’s religious beliefs no matter the impact that ac-\ncommodation may have on . . . thousands of women em-\n4           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nployed by Hobby Lobby.” Post, at 2.1 The effect of the\nHHS-created accommodation on the women employed by\nHobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these\ncases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation,\nthese women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives without cost sharing.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very\nbroad protection for religious liberty. RFRA’s enactment\ncame three years after this Court’s decision in Employ­\nment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494\nU. S. 872 (1990), which largely repudiated the method of\nanalyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in cases\nlike Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), and Wiscon­\nsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972). In determining whether\nchallenged government actions violated the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, those decisions used a\nbalancing test that took into account whether the chal-\nlenged action imposed a substantial burden on the prac-\ntice of religion, and if it did, whether it was needed to\nserve a compelling government interest. Applying this\ntest, the Court held in Sherbert that an employee who was\nfired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be\ndenied unemployment benefits. 374 U. S., at 408–409.\nAnd in Yoder, the Court held that Amish children could\nnot be required to comply with a state law demanding that\nthey remain in school until the age of 16 even though their\nreligion required them to focus on uniquely Amish values\nand beliefs during their formative adolescent years. 406\nU. S., at 210–211, 234–236.\n   In Smith, however, the Court rejected “the balancing\n——————\n  1 See also post, at 8 (“The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and\n\nConestoga . . . would deny [their employees] access to contraceptive\ncoverage that the ACA would otherwise secure”)\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntest set forth in Sherbert.” 494 U. S., at 883. Smith con-\ncerned two members of the Native American Church who\nwere fired for ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes.\nWhen they sought unemployment benefits, the State of\nOregon rejected their claims on the ground that consump-\ntion of peyote was a crime, but the Oregon Supreme Court,\napplying the Sherbert test, held that the denial of benefits\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. 494 U. S., at 875.\n   This Court then reversed, observing that use of the\nSherbert test whenever a person objected on religious\ngrounds to the enforcement of a generally applicable law\n“would open the prospect of constitutionally required\nreligious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every\nconceivable kind.” 494 U. S., at 888. The Court therefore\nheld that, under the First Amendment, “neutral, generally\napplicable laws may be applied to religious practices even\nwhen not supported by a compelling governmental inter-\nest.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 514 (1997).\n   Congress responded to Smith by enacting RFRA.\n“[L]aws [that are] ‘neutral’ toward religion,” Congress\nfound, “may burden religious exercise as surely as laws\nintended to interfere with religious exercise.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb(a)(2); see also §2000bb(a)(4). In order to ensure\nbroad protection for religious liberty, RFRA provides that\n“Government shall not substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule\nof general applicability.” §2000bb–1(a).2 If the Govern-\nment substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion,\nunder the Act that person is entitled to an exemption from\nthe rule unless the Government “demonstrates that appli-\ncation of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of\na compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\n——————\n  2 The Act defines “government” to include any “department” or\n\n“agency” of the United States. §2000bb–2(1).\n6            BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).3\n   As enacted in 1993, RFRA applied to both the Federal\nGovernment and the States, but the constitutional author-\nity invoked for regulating federal and state agencies dif-\nfered. As applied to a federal agency, RFRA is based on\nthe enumerated power that supports the particular agen-\ncy’s work,4 but in attempting to regulate the States and\ntheir subdivisions, Congress relied on its power under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the\nFirst Amendment. 521 U. S., at 516–517. In City of\nBoerne, however, we held that Congress had overstepped\nits Section 5 authority because “[t]he stringent test RFRA\ndemands” “far exceed[ed] any pattern or practice of uncon-\nstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as\ninterpreted in Smith.” Id., at 533–534. See also id., at\n532.\n   Following our decision in City of Boerne, Congress\npassed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000cc et seq. That statute, enacted under Congress’s\nCommerce and Spending Clause powers, imposes the\nsame general test as RFRA but on a more limited category\nof governmental actions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544\nU. S. 709, 715–716 (2005). And, what is most relevant for\npresent purposes, RLUIPA amended RFRA’s definition of\nthe “exercise of religion.” See §2000bb–2(4) (importing\nRLUIPA definition). Before RLUIPA, RFRA’s definition\n\n——————\n  3 In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S., 507 (1997), we wrote that\n\nRFRA’s “least restrictive means requirement was not used in the pre-\nSmith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.” Id., at 509. On this\nunderstanding of our pre-Smith cases, RFRA did more than merely\nrestore the balancing test used in the Sherbert line of cases; it provided\neven broader protection for religious liberty than was available under\nthose decisions.\n  4 See, e.g., Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F. 3d 96, 108 (CA2 2006); Guam v.\n\nGuerrero, 290 F. 3d 1210, 1220 (CA9 2002).\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

(defining “exercise of religion” as “the exer-\ncise of religion under the First Amendment”). In RLUIPA,\nin an obvious effort to effect a complete separation from\nFirst Amendment case law, Congress deleted the reference\nto the First Amendment and defined the “exercise of reli-\ngion” to include “any exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”\n§2000cc–5(7)(A). And Congress mandated that this con-\ncept “be construed in favor of a broad protection of reli-\ngious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the\nterms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc–\n3(g).5\n                             B\n   At issue in these cases are HHS regulations promul-\ngated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nof 2010 (ACA), 124 Stat. 119. ACA generally requires\nemployers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer\n“a group health plan or group health insurance coverage”\nthat provides “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U. S. C.\n§5000A(f)(2); §§4980H(a), (c)(2). Any covered employer\nthat does not provide such coverage must pay a substan-\ntial price. Specifically, if a covered employer provides\ngroup health insurance but its plan fails to comply with\nACA’s group-health-plan requirements, the employer may\nbe required to pay $100 per day for each affected “individ-\n——————\n   5 The principal dissent appears to contend that this rule of construc-\n\ntion should apply only when defining the “exercise of religion” in an\nRLUIPA case, but not in a RFRA case. See post, at 11, n. 10. That\nargument is plainly wrong. Under this rule of construction, the phrase\n“exercise of religion,” as it appears in RLUIPA, must be interpreted\nbroadly, and RFRA states that the same phrase, as used in RFRA,\nmeans “religious exercis[e] as defined in [RLUIPA].” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb–2(4). It necessarily follows that the “exercise of religion”\nunder RFRA must be given the same broad meaning that applies under\nRLUIPA.\n8         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nual.” §§4980D(a)–(b). And if the employer decides to stop\nproviding health insurance altogether and at least one\nfull-time employee enrolls in a health plan and qualifies\nfor a subsidy on one of the government-run ACA exchanges,\nthe employer must pay $2,000 per year for each of its full-\ntime employees. §§4980H(a), (c)(1).\n   Unless an exception applies, ACA requires an employ-\ner’s group health plan or group-health-insurance coverage\nto furnish “preventive care and screenings” for women\nwithout “any cost sharing requirements.” 42 U. S. C.\n§300gg–13(a)(4). Congress itself, however, did not specify\nwhat types of preventive care must be covered. Instead,\nCongress authorized the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), a component of HHS, to make\nthat important and sensitive decision. Ibid. The HRSA in\nturn consulted the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group\nof volunteer advisers, in determining which preventive\nservices to require. See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725–8726 (2012).\n   In August 2011, based on the Institute’s recommenda-\ntions, the HRSA promulgated the Women’s Preventive\nServices Guidelines. See id., at 8725–8726, and n. 1;\nonline at http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2014, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). The Guidelines provide that nonex-\nempt employers are generally required to provide “cover-\nage, without cost sharing” for “[a]ll Food and Drug Ad-\nministration [(FDA)] approved contraceptive methods,\nsterilization procedures, and patient education and coun-\nseling.” 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Although many of the required, FDA-approved\nmethods of contraception work by preventing the fertiliza-\ntion of an egg, four of those methods (those specifically at\nissue in these cases) may have the effect of preventing an\nalready fertilized egg from developing any further by\ninhibiting its attachment to the uterus.

That category encompasses “churches,\ntheir integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associ-\nations of churches,” as well as “the exclusively religious\nactivities of any religious order.” See ibid (citing 26\nU. S. C. §§6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)).     In its Guidelines,\nHRSA exempted these organizations from the requirement\nto cover contraceptive services.        See http://hrsa.gov/\nwomensguidelines.\n   In addition, HHS has effectively exempted certain\nreligious nonprofit organizations, described under HHS\nregulations as “eligible organizations,” from the contracep-\ntive mandate. See 45 CFR §147.131(b); 78 Fed. Reg.\n39874 (2013). An “eligible organization” means a nonprofit\norganization that “holds itself out as a religious organi-\nzation” and “opposes providing coverage for some or all of\nany contraceptive services required to be covered . . . on\naccount of religious objections.” 45 CFR §147.131(b). To\nqualify for this accommodation, an employer must certify\nthat it is such an organization. §147.131(b)(4). When a\ngroup-health-insurance issuer receives notice that one of\nits clients has invoked this provision, the issuer must then\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan\n——————\n  6 We   will use “Brief for HHS” to refer to the Brief for Petitioners in\nNo. 13–354 and the Brief for Respondents in No. 13–356.

Reg. 39877.9\n   In addition to these exemptions for religious organiza-\ntions, ACA exempts a great many employers from most of\nits coverage requirements. Employers providing “grandfa-\nthered health plans”—those that existed prior to March\n23, 2010, and that have not made specified changes after\nthat date—need not comply with many of the Act’s re-\nquirements, including the contraceptive mandate. 42\nU. S. C. §§18011(a), (e). And employers with fewer than\n50 employees are not required to provide health insurance\n——————\n  8 In  the case of self-insured religious organizations entitled to the\naccommodation, the third-party administrator of the organization must\n“provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services” for the organi-\nzation’s employees without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on\nthe eligible organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiar-\nies.    78 Fed. Reg. 39893 (to be codified in 26 CFR §54.9815–\n2713A(b)(2)). The regulations establish a mechanism for these third-\nparty administrators to be compensated for their expenses by obtaining\na reduction in the fee paid by insurers to participate in the federally\nfacilitated exchanges. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39893 (to be codified in 26 CFR\n§54.9815–2713A (b)(3)). HHS believes that these fee reductions will not\nmaterially affect funding of the exchanges because “payments for\ncontraceptive services will represent only a small portion of total\n[exchange] user fees.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39882.\n   9 In a separate challenge to this framework for religious nonprofit\n\norganizations, the Court recently ordered that, pending appeal, the\neligible organizations be permitted to opt out of the contraceptive\nmandate by providing written notification of their objections to the\nSecretary of HHS, rather than to their insurance issuers or third-party\nadministrators.

According to\nHHS, the companies cannot sue because they seek to\nmake a profit for their owners, and the owners cannot\nbe heard because the regulations, at least as a formal mat-\nter, apply only to the companies and not to the owners\nas individuals. HHS’s argument would have dramatic\nconsequences.\n  Consider this Court’s decision in Braunfeld v.

In that case, five\nOrthodox Jewish merchants who ran small retail busi-\nnesses in Philadelphia challenged a Pennsylvania Sunday\nclosing law as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.\nBecause of their faith, these merchants closed their shops\non Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to\nremain shut on Sunday threatened them with financial\nruin. The Court entertained their claim (although it ruled\nagainst them on the merits), and if a similar claim were\nraised today under RFRA against a jurisdiction still sub-\nject to the Act (for example, the District of Columbia, see\n42 U. S. C. §2000bb–2(2)), the merchants would be enti-\ntled to be heard. According to HHS, however, if these\nmerchants chose to incorporate their businesses—with-\nout in any way changing the size or nature of their busi-\nnesses—they would forfeit all RFRA (and free-exercise)\nrights. HHS would put these merchants to a difficult\nchoice: either give up the right to seek judicial protection\nof their religious liberty or forgo the benefits, available to\ntheir competitors, of operating as corporations.\n   As we have seen, RFRA was designed to provide very\nbroad protection for religious liberty. By enacting RFRA,\nCongress went far beyond what this Court has held is\nconstitutionally required.18 Is there any reason to think\nthat the Congress that enacted such sweeping protection\nput small-business owners to the choice that HHS sug-\ngests? An examination of RFRA’s text, to which we turn\n——————\n   18 As discussed, n. 3, supra, in City of Boerne we stated that RFRA, by\n\nimposing a least-restrictive-means test, went beyond what was re-\nquired by our pre-Smith decisions. Although the author of the principal\ndissent joined the Court’s opinion in City of Boerne, she now claims that\nthe statement was incorrect. Post, at 12. For present purposes, it is\nunnecessary to adjudicate this dispute. Even if RFRA simply restored\nthe status quo ante, there is no reason to believe, as HHS and the\ndissent seem to suggest, that the law was meant to be limited to situa-\ntions that fall squarely within the holdings of pre-Smith cases. See\ninfra, at 25–28.\n18         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the next part of this opinion, reveals that Congress did\nno such thing.\n   As we will show, Congress provided protection for people\nlike the Hahns and Greens by employing a familiar legal\nfiction: It included corporations within RFRA’s definition\nof “persons.” But it is important to keep in mind that the\npurpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human\nbeings. A corporation is simply a form of organization\nused by human beings to achieve desired ends. An estab-\nlished body of law specifies the rights and obligations of\nthe people (including shareholders, officers, and employ-\nees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or\nanother. When rights, whether constitutional or statu-\ntory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect\nthe rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth\nAmendment protection to corporations protects the privacy\ninterests of employees and others associated with the\ncompany. Protecting corporations from government sei-\nzure of their property without just compensation protects\nall those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial\nwell-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of\ncorporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel\nprotects the religious liberty of the humans who own and\ncontrol those companies.\n   In holding that Conestoga, as a “secular, for-profit cor-\nporation,” lacks RFRA protection, the Third Circuit wrote\nas follows:\n     “General business corporations do not, separate and\n     apart from the actions or belief systems of their indi­\n     vidual owners or employees, exercise religion. They do\n     not pray, worship, observe sacraments or take other\n     religiously-motivated actions separate and apart from\n     the intention and direction of their individual actors.”\n     724 F. 3d, at 385 (emphasis added).\nAll of this is true—but quite beside the point.

S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b), and RFRA\nitself does not define the term “person.” We therefore look\nto the Dictionary Act, which we must consult “[i]n deter-\nmining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the\ncontext indicates otherwise.” 1 U. S. C. §1.\n   Under the Dictionary Act, “the wor[d] ‘person’ . . . in-\nclude[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms,\npartnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well\nas individuals.” Ibid.; see FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (“We have no doubt that\n‘person,’ in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities.\nThe Dictionary Act makes that clear”). Thus, unless there\nis something about the RFRA context that “indicates\notherwise,” the Dictionary Act provides a quick, clear, and\naffirmative answer to the question whether the companies\ninvolved in these cases may be heard.\n   We see nothing in RFRA that suggests a congressional\nintent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition, and\nHHS makes little effort to argue otherwise. We have\nentertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by\nnonprofit corporations, see Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita\nBeneficiente União do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418 (2006)\n(RFRA); Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church\nand School v. EEOC, 565 U. S. ___ (2012) (Free Exercise);\nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\nS. 520 (1993) (Free Exercise), and HHS concedes that a\nnonprofit corporation can be a “person” within the mean-\ning of RFRA. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 17;\n20           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nReply Brief in No. 13–354, at 7–8.19\n  This concession effectively dispatches any argument\nthat the term “person” as used in RFRA does not reach the\nclosely held corporations involved in these cases. No\nknown understanding of the term “person” includes some\nbut not all corporations. The term “person” sometimes\nencompasses artificial persons (as the Dictionary Act\ninstructs), and it sometimes is limited to natural persons.\nBut no conceivable definition of the term includes natural\npersons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit\ncorporations.20 Cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 378\n(2005) (“To give th[e] same words a different meaning for\neach category would be to invent a statute rather than\ninterpret one”).\n                             2\n  The principal argument advanced by HHS and the\nprincipal dissent regarding RFRA protection for Hobby\nLobby, Conestoga, and Mardel focuses not on the statutory\nterm “person,” but on the phrase “exercise of religion.”\nAccording to HHS and the dissent, these corporations are\nnot protected by RFRA because they cannot exercise reli-\ngion. Neither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides any\npersuasive explanation for this conclusion.\n  Is it because of the corporate form? The corporate form\nalone cannot provide the explanation because, as we have\npointed out, HHS concedes that nonprofit corporations can\n——————\n  19 Cf. Brief for Federal Petitioners in O Centro, O.

The dissent suggests that nonprofit\ncorporations are special because furthering their reli-\ngious “autonomy . . . often furthers individual religious\nfreedom as well.” Post, at 15 (quoting Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 342 (1987) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment)). But this principle applies\nequally to for-profit corporations: Furthering their re-\nligious freedom also “furthers individual religious freedom.”\nIn these cases, for example, allowing Hobby Lobby, Con-\nestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the\nreligious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns.21\n   If the corporate form is not enough, what about the\nprofit-making objective? In Braunfeld, 366 U. S. 599, we\nentertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who\nwere attempting to make a profit as retail merchants, and\nthe Court never even hinted that this objective precluded\ntheir claims. As the Court explained in a later case, the\n“exercise of religion” involves “not only belief and profes-\nsion but the performance of (or abstention from) physical\nacts” that are “engaged in for religious reasons.” Smith,\n494 U. S., at 877. Business practices that are compelled or\nlimited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comforta-\nbly within that definition. Thus, a law that “operates so\nas to make the practice of . . . religious beliefs more expen-\nsive” in the context of business activities imposes a burden\non the exercise of religion. Braunfeld, supra, at 605; see\nUnited States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 257 (1982) (recognizing\nthat “compulsory participation in the social security sys-\ntem interferes with [Amish employers’] free exercise\n——————\n  21 Although the principal dissent seems to think that Justice Bren-\n\nnan’s statement in Amos provides a ground for holding that for-profit\ncorporations may not assert free-exercise claims, that was not Justice\nBrennan’s view.

See post, at 19 (dismissing the relevance of Braunfeld in part\nbecause “[t]he free exercise claim asserted there was promptly rejected\non the merits”).\n   23 See, e.g., 724 F. 3d, at 385 (“We do not see how a for-profit, ‘artifi-\n\ncial being,’ . . . that was created to make money” could exercise reli-\ngion); Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F. 3d 850, 857 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J.\ndissenting) (“So far as it appears, the mission of Grote Industries, like\nthat of any other for-profit, secular business, is to make money in the\ncommercial sphere”); Autocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 730 F. 3d 618, 626\n(CA7 2013) (“Congress did not intend to include corporations primarily\norganized for secular, profit-seeking purposes as ‘persons’ under\nRFRA”); see also 723 F. 3d, at 1171–1172 (Briscoe, C. J., dissenting)\n(“[T]he specific purpose for which [a corporation] is created matters\ngreatly to how it will be categorized and treated under the law” and “it\nis undisputed that Hobby Lobby and Mardel are for-profit corporations\nfocused on selling merchandise to consumers”).\n   The principal dissent makes a similar point, stating that “[f]or-profit\ncorporations are different from religious nonprofits in that they use\nlabor to make a profit, rather than to perpetuate the religious values\nshared by a community of believers.” Post, at 18–19 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The first half of this statement is a tautology; for-\nprofit corporations do indeed differ from nonprofits insofar as they seek\nto make a profit for their owners, but the second part is factually\nuntrue. As the activities of the for-profit corporations involved in these\ncases show, some for-profit corporations do seek “to perpetuate the\nreligious values shared,” in these cases, by their owners. Conestoga’s\nVision and Values Statement declares that the company is dedicated to\noperating “in [a] manner that reflects our Christian heritage and the\nhighest ethical and moral principles of business.” App. in No. 13–356,\np. 94. Similarly, Hobby Lobby’s statement of purpose proclaims that\nthe company “is committed to . . . Honoring the Lord in all we do by\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nargument flies in the face of modern corporate law. “Each\nAmerican jurisdiction today either expressly or by implica-\ntion authorizes corporations to be formed under its general\ncorporation act for any lawful purpose or business.” 1 J.\nCox & T. Hazen, Treatise of the Law of Corporations §4:1,\np. 224 (3d ed. 2010) (emphasis added); see 1A W. Fletcher,\nCyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §102 (rev. ed. 2010).\nWhile it is certainly true that a central objective of for-\nprofit corporations is to make money, modern corporate\nlaw does not require for-profit corporations to pursue\nprofit at the expense of everything else, and many do not\ndo so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval,\nsupport a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at\nall uncommon for such corporations to further humanitar-\nian and other altruistic objectives. Many examples come\nreadily to mind. So long as its owners agree, a for-profit\ncorporation may take costly pollution-control and energy-\nconservation measures that go beyond what the law re-\nquires. A for-profit corporation that operates facilities in\nother countries may exceed the requirements of local law\nregarding working conditions and benefits. If for-profit\ncorporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is\nno apparent reason why they may not further religious\nobjectives as well.\n   HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corpo-\n——————\noperating . . . in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.” App. in\nNo. 13–354, p. 135. The dissent also believes that history is not on our\nside because even Blackstone recognized the distinction between\n“ecclesiastical and lay” corporations. Post, at 18. What Blackstone\nillustrates, however, is that dating back to 1765, there was no sharp\ndivide among corporations in their capacity to exercise religion; Black-\nstone recognized that even what he termed “lay” corporations might\nserve “the promotion of piety.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaw of England 458–459 (1765). And whatever may have been the case\nat the time of Blackstone, modern corporate law (and the law of the\nStates in which these three companies are incorporated) allows for-\nprofit corporations to “perpetuat[e] religious values.”\n24           BURWELL v.

Not all\ncorporations that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in\norder to maximize profit. For example, organizations with\nreligious and charitable aims might organize as for-profit\ncorporations because of the potential advantages of that\ncorporate form, such as the freedom to participate in\nlobbying for legislation or campaigning for political candi-\ndates who promote their religious or charitable goals.24 In\nfact, recognizing the inherent compatibility between estab-\nlishing a for-profit corporation and pursuing nonprofit\ngoals, States have increasingly adopted laws formally\nrecognizing hybrid corporate forms.

This argument has many\nflaws.\n   First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted\nsuggested that the statutory phrase “exercise of religion\nunder the First Amendment” was meant to be tied to this\nCourt’s pre-Smith interpretation of that Amendment.\nWhen first enacted, RFRA defined the “exercise of reli-\ngion” to mean “the exercise of religion under the First\nAmendment”—not the exercise of religion as recognized\nonly by then-existing Supreme Court precedents. 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). When Congress wants to\nlink the meaning of a statutory provision to a body of this\nCourt’s case law, it knows how to do so. See, e.g., Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28\n26           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1) (authorizing habeas relief from a\nstate-court decision that “was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates”).\n   Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear\nenough on this point—and we think it was—the amend-\nment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt.\nThat amendment deleted the prior reference to the First\nAmendment, see 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (2000 ed.) (in-\ncorporating §2000cc–5), and neither HHS nor the principal\ndissent can explain why Congress did this if it wanted to\ntie RFRA coverage tightly to the specific holdings of our\npre-Smith free-exercise cases. Moreover, as discussed, the\namendment went further, providing that the exercise of\nreligion “shall be construed in favor of a broad protection\nof religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by\nthe terms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc–\n3(g). It is simply not possible to read these provisions as\nrestricting the concept of the “exercise of religion” to those\npractices specifically addressed in our pre-Smith decisions.\n   Third, the one pre-Smith case involving the free-exercise\nrights of a for-profit corporation suggests, if anything, that\nfor-profit corporations possess such rights. In Gallagher v.\nCrown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc., 366 U. S. 617\n(1961), the Massachusetts Sunday closing law was chal-\nlenged by a kosher market that was organized as a for-\nprofit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a\nrabbi. The Commonwealth argued that the corporation\nlacked “standing” to assert a free-exercise claim,26 but not\none member of the Court expressed agreement with that\n\n——————\n  26 See  Brief for Appellants in Gallagher, O. T. 1960 No. 11, pp. 16, 28–\n31 (arguing that corporation “has no ‘religious belief’ or ‘religious\nliberty,’ and had no standing in court to assert that its free exercise of\nreligion was impaired”).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargument. The plurality opinion for four Justices rejected\nthe First Amendment claim on the merits based on the\nreasoning in Braunfeld, and reserved decision on the\nquestion whether the corporation had “standing” to raise\nthe claim. See 366 U. S., at 631. The three dissenters,\nJustices Douglas, Brennan, and Stewart, found the law\nunconstitutional as applied to the corporation and the\nother challengers and thus implicitly recognized their\nright to assert a free-exercise claim. See id., at 642 (Bren-\nnan, J., joined by Stewart, J., dissenting); McGowan v.\nMaryland, 366 U. S. 420, 578–579 (1961) (Douglas, J.,\ndissenting as to related cases including Gallagher). Fi-\nnally, Justice Frankfurter’s opinion, which was joined by\nJustice Harlan, upheld the Massachusetts law on the\nmerits but did not question or reserve decision on the\nissue of the right of the corporation or any of the other\nchallengers to be heard. See McGowan, 366 U. S., at 521–\n522. It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted\nto provide very broad protection for religious liberty,\nleft for-profit corporations unprotected simply because in\nGallagher—the only pre-Smith case in which the issue\nwas raised—a majority of the Justices did not find it nec-\nessary to decide whether the kosher market’s corporate\nstatus barred it from raising a free-exercise claim.\n    Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely\nrestored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form\nand did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA claim unless\nthat plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of\nwhom had brought a free-exercise claim that this Court\nentertained in the years before Smith. For example, we\nare not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court\nentertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident\nnoncitizen. Are such persons also beyond RFRA’s protec-\ntive reach simply because the Court never addressed their\nrights before Smith?\n   Presumably in recognition of the weakness of this ar-\n28           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngument, both HHS and the principal dissent fall back on\nthe broader contention that the Nation lacks a tradition of\nexempting for-profit corporations from generally applica-\nble laws. By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like Title\nVII, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–19(A), expressly exempt churches\nand other nonprofit religious institutions but not for-profit\ncorporations. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–356, p. 26. In\nmaking this argument, however, HHS did not call to our\nattention the fact that some federal statutes do exempt\ncategories of entities that include for-profit corporations\nfrom laws that would otherwise require these entities to\nengage in activities to which they object on grounds of\nconscience. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §300a–7(b)(2); §238n(a).27\nIf Title VII and similar laws show anything, it is\nthat Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a\nreligious accommodation not to extend to for-profit\ncorporations.\n\n\n——————\n   27 The principal dissent points out that “the exemption codified in\n\n§238n(a) was not enacted until three years after RFRA’s passage.”\nPost, at 16, n. 15. The dissent takes this to mean that RFRA did not, in\nfact, “ope[n] all statutory schemes to religion-based challenges by for-\nprofit corporations” because if it had “there would be no need for a\nstatute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.” Ibid.\n   This argument fails to recognize that the protection provided by\n§238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by RFRA.\nSection 238n(a) flatly prohibits discrimination against a covered\nhealthcare facility for refusing to engage in certain activities related to\nabortion. If a covered healthcare facility challenged such discrimina-\ntion under RFRA, by contrast, the discrimination would be unlawful\nonly if a court concluded, among other things, that there was a less\nrestrictive means of achieving any compelling government interest.\n   In addition, the dissent’s argument proves too much. Section\n238n(a) applies evenly to “any health care entity”—whether it is a\nreligious nonprofit entity or a for-profit entity. There is no dispute that\nRFRA protects religious nonprofit corporations, so if §238n(a) were\nredundant as applied to for-profit corporations, it would be equally\nredundant as applied to nonprofits.\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

HHS goes so far as to raise the\nspecter of “divisive, polarizing proxy battles over the reli-\ngious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such\nas IBM or General Electric.” Brief for HHS in No. 13–356,\nat 30.\n   These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded\ncorporations, and it seems unlikely that the sort of corpo-\nrate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA\nclaims. HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly\ntraded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous\npractical restraints would likely prevent that from occur-\nring. For example, the idea that unrelated shareholders—\nincluding institutional investors with their own set of\nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the\nsame religious beliefs seems improbable. In any event, we\nhave no occasion in these cases to consider RFRA’s ap-\nplicability to such companies. The companies in the cases\nbefore us are closely held corporations, each owned and\ncontrolled by members of a single family, and no one has\ndisputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs.28\n   HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported\nproblem of determining the sincerity of an asserted reli-\ngious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corpora-\ntions from RFRA’s protection. On the contrary, the scope\nof RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the\nability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims.\nRLUIPA applies to “institutionalized persons,” a category\n——————\n  28 To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be “sin-\ncere”; a corporation’s pretextual assertion of a religious belief in order\nto obtain an exemption for financial reasons would fail. Cf., e.g., United\nStates v. Quaintance, 608 F. 3d 717, 718–719 (CA10 2010).\n30          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat consists primarily of prisoners, and by the time of\nRLUIPA’s enactment, the propensity of some prisoners to\nassert claims of dubious sincerity was well documented.29\nNevertheless, after our decision in City of Boerne, Con-\ngress enacted RLUIPA to preserve the right of prisoners to\nraise religious liberty claims. If Congress thought that the\nfederal courts were up to the job of dealing with insincere\nprisoner claims, there is no reason to believe that Con-\ngress limited RFRA’s reach out of concern for the seem-\ningly less difficult task of doing the same in corporate\ncases. And if, as HHS seems to concede, Congress wanted\nRFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply Brief\nin No. 13–354, at 7–8, what reason is there to think that\nCongress believed that spotting insincere claims would\nbe tougher in cases involving for-profits?\n   HHS and the principal dissent express concern about\nthe possibility of disputes among the owners of corpora-\ntions, but that is not a problem that arises because of\nRFRA or that is unique to this context. The owners of\nclosely held corporations may—and sometimes do—\ndisagree about the conduct of business. 1 Treatise of the\nLaw of Corporations §14:11. And even if RFRA did not\nexist, the owners of a company might well have a dispute\nrelating to religion. For example, some might want a\ncompany’s stores to remain open on the Sabbath in order\nto make more money, and others might want the stores to\nclose for religious reasons. State corporate law provides a\nready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example,\ndictating how a corporation can establish its governing\nstructure. See, e.g., ibid; id., §3:2; Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8,\n§351 (2011) (providing that certificate of incorporation\n\n——————\n  29 See,\n        e.g., Ochs v.

Courts will turn to that structure and the\nunderlying state law in resolving disputes.\n  For all these reasons, we hold that a federal regulation’s\nrestriction on the activities of a for-profit closely held\ncorporation must comply with RFRA.30\n                             IV\n  Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask\nwhether the HHS contraceptive mandate “substantially\nburden[s]” the exercise of religion. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–\n1(a). We have little trouble concluding that it does.\n——————\n  30 The   principal dissent attaches significance to the fact that the\n“Senate voted down [a] so-called ‘conscience amendment,’ which would\nhave enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage\nbased on its asserted religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Post, at 6.\nThe dissent would evidently glean from that vote an intent by the\nSenate to prohibit for-profit corporate employers from refusing to offer\ncontraceptive coverage for religious reasons, regardless of whether the\ncontraceptive mandate could pass muster under RFRA’s standards.\nBut that is not the only plausible inference from the failed amend-\nment—or even the most likely. For one thing, the text of the amend-\nment was “written so broadly that it would allow any employer to deny\nany health service to any American for virtually any reason—not just\nfor religious objections.” 158 Cong. Rec. S1165 (Mar. 1, 2012) (emphasis\nadded). Moreover, the amendment would have authorized a blanket\nexemption for religious or moral objectors; it would not have subjected\nreligious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny called for by RFRA, in\nwhich a court must consider not only the burden of a requirement on\nreligious adherents, but also the government’s interest and how nar-\nrowly tailored the requirement is. It is thus perfectly reasonable to\nbelieve that the amendment was voted down because it extended more\nbroadly than the pre-existing protections of RFRA. And in any event,\neven if a rejected amendment to a bill could be relevant in other con-\ntexts, it surely cannot be relevant here, because any “Federal statutory\nlaw adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to [RFRA] unless such\nlaw explicitly excludes such application by reference to [RFRA].” 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb–3(b) (emphasis added). It is not plausible to find such\nan explicit reference in the meager legislative history on which the\ndissent relies.\n32          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n  As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere\nreligious belief that life begins at conception. They there-\nfore object on religious grounds to providing health insur-\nance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS\nacknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 9, n. 4,\nmay result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring\nthe Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for\nsuch coverage, the HHS mandate demands that they\nengage in conduct that seriously violates their religious\nbeliefs.\n  If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not\nyield to this demand, the economic consequences will be\nsevere. If the companies continue to offer group health\nplans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they\nwill be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual. 26\nU. S. C. §4980D. For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount\nto $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for\nConestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or\n$33 million per year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000\nper day or about $15 million per year. These sums are\nsurely substantial.\n  It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assess-\nments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus\nforcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one\nof the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least\none of their full-time employees were to qualify for a sub-\nsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course\nwould also entail substantial economic consequences. The\ncompanies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee\neach year. §4980H. These penalties would amount to\nroughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for\nConestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.\n                              B\n     Although these totals are high, amici supporting HHS\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                  33\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhave suggested that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is\nactually less than the average cost of providing health\ninsurance, see Brief for Religious Organizations 22, and\ntherefore, they claim, the companies could readily elimi-\nnate any substantial burden by forcing their employees to\nobtain insurance in the government exchanges. We do not\ngenerally entertain arguments that were not raised below\nand are not advanced in this Court by any party, see\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60,\nn. 2 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 532, n. 13\n(1979); Knetsch v. United States, 364 U. S. 361, 370 (1960),\nand there are strong reasons to adhere to that practice in\nthese cases. HHS, which presumably could have compiled\nthe relevant statistics, has never made this argument—\nnot in its voluminous briefing or at oral argument in this\nCourt nor, to our knowledge, in any of the numerous cases\nin which the issue now before us has been litigated around\nthe country. As things now stand, we do not even know\nwhat the Government’s position might be with respect to\nthese amici’s intensely empirical argument.31 For this\nsame reason, the plaintiffs have never had an opportunity\nto respond to this novel claim that—contrary to their\nlongstanding practice and that of most large employers—\nthey would be better off discarding their employer insur-\nance plans altogether.\n  Even if we were to reach this argument, we would find it\nunpersuasive. As an initial matter, it entirely ignores the\nfact that the Hahns and Greens and their companies have\nreligious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage\nfor their employees. Before the advent of ACA, they were\nnot legally compelled to provide insurance, but they never-\ntheless did so—in part, no doubt, for conventional business\n——————\n   31 Indeed, one of HHS’s stated reasons for establishing the religious\n\naccommodation was to “encourag[e] eligible organizations to continue to\noffer health coverage.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39882 (2013) (emphasis added).\n34          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs\ngovern their relations with their employees. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 13–356, p. 11g; App. in No. 13–354,\nat 139.\n  Putting aside the religious dimension of the decision to\nprovide insurance, moreover, it is far from clear that the\nnet cost to the companies of providing insurance is more\nthan the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying\nthe ACA penalty. Health insurance is a benefit that em-\nployees value. If the companies simply eliminated that\nbenefit and forced employees to purchase their own insur-\nance on the exchanges, without offering additional com-\npensation, it is predictable that the companies would face\na competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting\nskilled workers. See App. in No. 13–354, at 153.\n  The companies could attempt to make up for the elimi-\nnation of a group health plan by increasing wages, but this\nwould be costly. Group health insurance is generally less\nexpensive than comparable individual coverage, so the\namount of the salary increase needed to fully compensate\nfor the termination of insurance coverage may well exceed\nthe cost to the companies of providing the insurance. In\naddition, any salary increase would have to take into\naccount the fact that employees must pay income taxes on\nwages but not on the value of employer-provided health\ninsurance. 26 U. S. C. §106(a). Likewise, employers can\ndeduct the cost of providing health insurance, see\n§162(a)(1), but apparently cannot deduct the amount of\nthe penalty that they must pay if insurance is not pro-\nvided; that difference also must be taken into account.\nGiven these economic incentives, it is far from clear that it\nwould be financially advantageous for an employer to drop\ncoverage and pay the penalty.32\n——————\n 32 Attempting to compensate for dropped insurance by raising wages\n\nwould also present administrative difficulties. In order to provide full\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

We doubt\nthat the Congress that enacted RFRA—or, for that matter,\nACA—would have believed it a tolerable result to put\nfamily-run businesses to the choice of violating their sin-\ncerely held religious beliefs or making all of their employ-\nees lose their existing healthcare plans.\n                             C\n  In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not\nimpose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion,\nHHS’s main argument (echoed by the principal dissent) is\nbasically that the connection between what the objecting\nparties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for\nfour methods of contraception that may operate after the\nfertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be\nmorally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too\nattenuated. Brief for HHS in 13–354, pp. 31–34; post, at\n22–23. HHS and the dissent note that providing the\ncoverage would not itself result in the destruction of an\nembryo; that would occur only if an employee chose to take\nadvantage of the coverage and to use one of the four meth-\nods at issue.33 Ibid.\n——————\ncompensation for employees, the companies would have to calculate the\nvalue to employees of the convenience of retaining their employer-\nprovided coverage and thus being spared the task of attempting to find\nand sign up for a comparable plan on an exchange. And because some\nbut not all of the companies’ employees may qualify for subsidies on an\nexchange, it would be nearly impossible to calculate a salary increase\nthat would accurately restore the status quo ante for all employees.\n  33 This argument is not easy to square with the position taken by\n\nHHS in providing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for\nreligious employers, such as churches, that have the very same reli-\ngious objections as the Hahns and Greens and their companies. The\nconnection between what these religious employers would be required\n36          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument dodges the question that RFRA presents\n(whether the HHS mandate imposes a substantial burden\non the ability of the objecting parties to conduct business\nin accordance with their religious beliefs) and instead\naddresses a very different question that the federal courts\nhave no business addressing (whether the religious belief\nasserted in a RFRA case is reasonable). The Hahns and\nGreens believe that providing the coverage demanded by\nthe HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an\nembryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for\nthem to provide the coverage. This belief implicates a\ndifficult and important question of religion and moral\nphilosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is\nwrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in\nitself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the\ncommission of an immoral act by another.34 Arrogating\nthe authority to provide a binding national answer to this\nreligious and philosophical question, HHS and the princi-\n——————\nto do if not exempted (provide insurance coverage for particular contra-\nceptives) and the ultimate event that they find morally wrong (destruc-\ntion of an embryo) is exactly the same. Nevertheless, as discussed,\nHHS and the Labor and Treasury Departments authorized the exemp-\ntion from the contraceptive mandate of group health plans of certain\nreligious employers, and later expanded the exemption to include\ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contracep-\ntive coverage. 78 Fed. Reg. 39871. When this was done, the Govern-\nment made clear that its objective was to “protec[t]” these religious\nobjectors “from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for such\ncoverage.” Ibid. Those exemptions would be hard to understand if the\nplaintiffs’ objections here were not substantial.\n   34 See, e.g., Oderberg, The Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing, in\n\nModern Moral Philosophy 203–228 (A. O’Hear ed. 2004); T. Higgins,\nMan as Man: The Science and Art of Ethics 353, 355 (1949) (“The\ngeneral principles governing cooperation” in wrongdoing—i.e., “physical\nactivity (or its omission) by which a person assists in the evil act of\nanother who is the principal agent”—“present troublesome difficulties\nin application”); 1 H.

For good reason, we have repeatedly refused to\ntake such a step. See, e.g., Smith, 494 U. S., at 887 (“Re-\npeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned\nthat courts must not presume to determine . . . the plausi-\nbility of a religious claim”); Hernandez v. Commissioner,\n490 U. S. 680, 699 (1989); Presbyterian Church in U. S. v.\nMary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church,\n393 U. S. 440, 450 (1969).\n   Moreover, in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employ­\nment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707 (1981), we considered\nand rejected an argument that is nearly identical to the\none now urged by HHS and the dissent. In Thomas, a\nJehovah’s Witness was initially employed making sheet\nsteel for a variety of industrial uses, but he was later\ntransferred to a job making turrets for tanks. Id., at 710.\nBecause he objected on religious grounds to participating\nin the manufacture of weapons, he lost his job and sought\nunemployment compensation. Ruling against the em-\nployee, the state court had difficulty with the line that\nthe employee drew between work that he found to be con-\nsistent with his religious beliefs (helping to manufacture\nsteel that was used in making weapons) and work that he\nfound morally objectionable (helping to make the weapons\nthemselves). This Court, however, held that “it is not for\nus to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”\nId., at 715.35\n   Similarly, in these cases, the Hahns and Greens and\ntheir companies sincerely believe that providing the in-\nsurance coverage demanded by the HHS regulations lies\non the forbidden side of the line, and it is not for us to say\nthat their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\nInstead, our “narrow function . . . in this context is to\n——————\n  35 The principal dissent makes no effort to reconcile its view about the\n\nsubstantial-burden requirement with our decision in Thomas.\n38        BURWELL v.

See Tilton\nv. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 689 (1971) (plurality); Board\nof Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236,\n248–249 (1968). But in those cases, while the subsidies\nwere clearly contrary to the challengers’ views on a secu-\nlar issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the chal-\nlengers never articulated a religious objection to the sub-\nsidies. As we put it in Tilton, they were “unable to\nidentify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of\ntheir religious beliefs.” 403 U. S., at 689 (plurality opin-\nion); see Allen, supra, at 249 (“[A]ppellants have not con-\ntended that the New York law in any way coerces them as\nindividuals in the practice of their religion”). Here, in\ncontrast, the plaintiffs do assert that funding the specific\ncontraceptive methods at issue violates their religious\nbeliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity. Be-\ncause the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an\nenormous sum of money—as much as $475 million per\nyear in the case of Hobby Lobby—if they insist on provid-\ning insurance coverage in accordance with their religious\nbeliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden\non those beliefs.\n                              V\n  Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a sub-\nstantial burden on the exercise of religion, we must move\non and decide whether HHS has shown that the mandate\nboth “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further-\ning that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U. S. C.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

RFRA, however, contemplates a “more\nfocused” inquiry: It “requires the Government to demon-\nstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through\napplication of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the\nparticular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is\nbeing substantially burdened.” O’Centro, 546 U. S., at\n430–431 (quoting §2000bb–1(b)). This requires us to\n“loo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests” and to “scru-\ntiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions\nto particular religious claimants”—in other words, to look\nto the marginal interest in enforcing the contraceptive\nmandate in these cases. O Centro, supra, at 431.\n   In addition to asserting these very broadly framed\ninterests, HHS maintains that the mandate serves a\ncompelling interest in ensuring that all women have ac-\ncess to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost\nsharing. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 14–15, 49;\nsee Brief for HHS in No. 13–356, at 10, 48. Under our\ncases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to\nobtain contraceptives, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\nU. S. 479, 485–486 (1965), and HHS tells us that “[s]tudies\nhave demonstrated that even moderate copayments for\npreventive services can deter patients from receiving those\nservices.” Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 50 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The objecting parties contend that HHS has not shown\nthat the mandate serves a compelling government inter-\nest, and it is arguable that there are features of ACA that\nsupport that view. As we have noted, many employees—\n40         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthose covered by grandfathered plans and those who work\nfor employers with fewer than 50 employees—may have no\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all.\n   HHS responds that many legal requirements have\nexceptions and the existence of exceptions does not in\nitself indicate that the principal interest served by a law is\nnot compelling. Even a compelling interest may be out-\nweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier\nconsideration. In these cases, however, the interest served\nby one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for grandfa-\nthered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoid-\ning the inconvenience of amending an existing plan.\nGrandfathered plans are required “to comply with a subset\nof the Affordable Care Act’s health reform provisions” that\nprovide what HHS has described as “particularly signifi-\ncant protections.” 75 Fed. Reg. 34540 (2010). But the\ncontraceptive mandate is expressly excluded from this\nsubset. Ibid.\n   We find it unnecessary to adjudicate this issue. We will\nassume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access\nto the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling\nwithin the meaning of RFRA, and we will proceed to con-\nsider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether HHS\nhas shown that the contraceptive mandate is “the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b)(2).\n                             B\n   The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally\ndemanding, see City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532, and it is\nnot satisfied here. HHS has not shown that it lacks other\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a\nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion by the ob-\njecting parties in these cases. See §§2000bb–1(a), (b)\n(requiring the Government to “demonstrat[e] that applica-\ntion of [a substantial] burden to the person . . . is the least\n                       Cite as: 573 U.

This would certainly\nbe less restrictive of the plaintiffs’ religious liberty, and\nHHS has not shown, see §2000bb–1(b)(2), that this is not a\nviable alternative. HHS has not provided any estimate of\nthe average cost per employee of providing access to\nthese contraceptives, two of which, according to the FDA,\nare designed primarily for emergency use. See Birth\nControl: Medicines to Help You, online at http://\nwww.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepubli\ncations/ucm313215.htm.       Nor has HHS provided any\nstatistics regarding the number of employees who might\nbe affected because they work for corporations like Hobby\nLobby, Conestoga, and Mardel. Nor has HHS told us that\nit is unable to provide such statistics. It seems likely,\nhowever, that the cost of providing the forms of contracep-\ntives at issue in these cases (if not all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives) would be minor when compared with the\noverall cost of ACA.

We do not doubt that cost may\n\n——————\n  37 In a related argument, HHS appears to maintain that a plaintiff\ncannot prevail on a RFRA claim that seeks an exemption from a legal\nobligation requiring the plaintiff to confer benefits on third parties.\nNothing in the text of RFRA or its basic purposes supports giving the\nGovernment an entirely free hand to impose burdens on religious\nexercise so long as those burdens confer a benefit on other individuals.\nIt is certainly true that in applying RFRA “courts must take adequate\naccount of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on\nnonbeneficiaries.” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 720 (2005)\n(applying RLUIPA). That consideration will often inform the analysis\nof the Government’s compelling interest and the availability of a less\nrestrictive means of advancing that interest. But it could not reasona-\nbly be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no matter how\nonerous and no matter how readily the government interest could be\nachieved through alternative means, is permissible under RFRA so long\nas the relevant legal obligation requires the religious adherent to confer\na benefit on third parties. Otherwise, for example, the Government\ncould decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience\nof customers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections\nfrom owning supermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must\nremain open on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn\ntips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning\nrestaurants). By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a\nthird party, the Government could turn all regulations into entitle-\nments to which nobody could object on religious grounds, rendering\nRFRA meaningless. In any event, our decision in these cases need not\nresult in any detrimental effect on any third party. As we explain, see\ninfra, at 43–44, the Government can readily arrange for other methods\nof providing contraceptives, without cost sharing, to employees who are\nunable to obtain them under their health-insurance plans due to their\nemployers’ religious objections.\n                    Cite as: 573 U.

Cf. §2000cc–3(c) (RLUIPA: “[T]his chapter may\nrequire a government to incur expenses in its own opera-\ntions to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.”). HHS’s view that RFRA can never require the\nGovernment to spend even a small amount reflects a\njudgment about the importance of religious liberty that\nwas not shared by the Congress that enacted that law.\n   In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a\nnew, government-funded program in order to conclude\nthat the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means\ntest. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its dis-\nposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring\nemployers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their\nreligious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already\nestablished an accommodation for nonprofit organizations\nwith religious objections. See supra, at 9–10, and nn. 8–9.\nUnder that accommodation, the organization can self-\ncertify that it opposes providing coverage for particular\ncontraceptive services. See 45 CFR §§147.131(b)(4), (c)(1);\n26 CFR §§54.9815–2713A(a)(4), (b). If the organization\nmakes such a certification, the organization’s insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator must “[e]xpressly\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health\ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group\nhealth plan” and “[p]rovide separate payments for any\ncontraceptive services required to be covered” without\nimposing “any cost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligi-\nble organization, the group health plan, or plan partici-\npants or beneficiaries.” 45 CFR §147.131(c)(2); 26 CFR\n§54.9815–2713A(c)(2).38\n——————\n 38 HHS   has concluded that insurers that insure eligible employers\n44           BURWELL v.

Reg. 39877.\nWith respect to self-insured plans, the regulations establish a mecha-\nnism for the eligible employers’ third-party administrators to obtain a\ncompensating reduction in the fee paid by insurers to participate in the\nfederally facilitated exchanges. HHS believes that this system will not\nhave a material effect on the funding of the exchanges because the\n“payments for contraceptive services will represent only a small portion\nof total [federally facilitated exchange] user fees.” Id., at 39882; see 26\nCFR §54.9815–2713A(b)(3).\n   39 See n. 9, supra.\n   40 The principal dissent faults us for being “noncommital” in refusing\n\nto decide a case that is not before us here.

This is indeed “scarcely what Congress con-\ntemplated.” Ibid.\n                              C\n   HHS and the principal dissent argue that a ruling in\nfavor of the objecting parties in these cases will lead to a\nflood of religious objections regarding a wide variety of\nmedical procedures and drugs, such as vaccinations and\nblood transfusions, but HHS has made no effort to sub-\nstantiate this prediction.42 HHS points to no evidence that\ninsurance plans in existence prior to the enactment of\nACA excluded coverage for such items. Nor has HHS\nprovided evidence that any significant number of employ-\ners sought exemption, on religious grounds, from any of\nACA’s coverage requirements other than the contraceptive\nmandate.\n   It is HHS’s apparent belief that no insurance-coverage\nmandate would violate RFRA—no matter how significantly\nit impinges on the religious liberties of employers—that\nwould lead to intolerable consequences.

The\nowners of many closely held corporations could not in good\nconscience provide such coverage, and thus HHS would\neffectively exclude these people from full participation in\nthe economic life of the Nation. RFRA was enacted to\nprevent such an outcome.\n   In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned\nsolely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision\nshould not be understood to hold that an insurance-\ncoverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with\nan employer’s religious beliefs. Other coverage require-\nments, such as immunizations, may be supported by dif-\nferent interests (for example, the need to combat the\nspread of infectious diseases) and may involve different\narguments about the least restrictive means of providing\nthem.\n   The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrim-\nination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might\nbe cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction.\nSee post, at 32–33. Our decision today provides no such\nshield. The Government has a compelling interest in\nproviding an equal opportunity to participate in the work-\nforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial\ndiscrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that criti-\ncal goal.\n   HHS also raises for the first time in this Court the\nargument that applying the contraceptive mandate to for-\nprofit employers with sincere religious objections is essen-\ntial to the comprehensive health-insurance scheme that\nACA establishes. HHS analogizes the contraceptive man-\ndate to the requirement to pay Social Security taxes,\nwhich we upheld in Lee despite the religious objection of\nan employer, but these cases are quite different. Our\nholding in Lee turned primarily on the special problems\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            47\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassociated with a national system of taxation. We noted\nthat “[t]he obligation to pay the social security tax initially\nis not fundamentally different from the obligation to pay\nincome taxes.” 455 U. S., at 260. Based on that premise,\nwe explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to\nseek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections\nto particular Government expenditures: “If, for example, a\nreligious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain\npercentage of the federal budget can be identified as de-\nvoted to war-related activities, such individuals would\nhave a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that\npercentage of the income tax.” Ibid. We observed that\n“[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were\nallowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments\nwere spent in a manner that violates their religious be-\nlief.” Ibid.; see O Centro, 546 U. S., at 435.\n   Lee was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the\nissue in Lee were analyzed under the RFRA framework,\nthe fundamental point would be that there simply is no\nless restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement\nto pay taxes. Because of the enormous variety of govern-\nment expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing tax-\npayers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on\nreligious grounds would lead to chaos.            Recognizing\nexemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very differ-\nent. ACA does not create a large national pool of tax\nrevenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage. Ra-\nther, individual employers like the plaintiffs purchase\ninsurance for their own employees. And contrary to the\nprincipal dissent’s characterization, the employers’ contri-\nbutions do not necessarily funnel into “undifferentiated\nfunds.” Post, at 23. The accommodation established by\nHHS requires issuers to have a mechanism by which to\n“segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible\norganization from the monies used to provide payments\nfor contraceptive services.” 45 CFR §147.131(c)(2)(ii).\n48          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nRecognizing a religious accommodation under RFRA for\nparticular coverage requirements, therefore, does not\nthreaten the viability of ACA’s comprehensive scheme in\nthe way that recognizing religious objections to particular\nexpenditures from general tax revenues would.43\n  In its final pages, the principal dissent reveals that its\nfundamental objection to the claims of the plaintiffs is an\nobjection to RFRA itself. The dissent worries about forc-\ning the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims\nmade by litigants seeking a religious exemption from\ngenerally applicable laws, and the dissent expresses a\ndesire to keep the courts out of this business. See post, at\n32–35. In making this plea, the dissent reiterates a point\nmade forcefully by the Court in Smith. 494 U. S., at 888–\n889 (applying the Sherbert test to all free-exercise claims\n“would open the prospect of constitutionally required\nreligious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every\nconceivable kind”). But Congress, in enacting RFRA, took\nthe position that “the compelling interest test as set forth\nin prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for\nstriking sensible balances between religious liberty and\ncompeting prior governmental interests.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb(a)(5). The wisdom of Congress’s judgment on this\n——————\n  43 HHS   highlights certain statements in the opinion in Lee that it\nregards as supporting its position in these cases. In particular, HHS\nnotes the statement that “[w]hen followers of a particular sect enter\ninto commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on\ntheir own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\nsuperimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in\nthat activity.” 455 U. S., at 261. Lee was a free exercise, not a RFRA,\ncase, and the statement to which HHS points, if taken at face value, is\nsquarely inconsistent with the plain meaning of RFRA. Under RFRA,\nwhen followers of a particular religion choose to enter into commercial\nactivity, the Government does not have a free hand in imposing obliga-\ntions that substantially burden their exercise of religion. Rather, the\nGovernment can impose such a burden only if the strict RFRA test is\nmet.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

At the outset it should be\nsaid that the Court’s opinion does not have the breadth\nand sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful\ndissent. The Court and the dissent disagree on the proper\ninterpretation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration\nAct of 1993 (RFRA), but do agree on the purpose of that\nstatute. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq. It is to ensure that\ninterests in religious freedom are protected. Ante, at 5–6;\npost, at 8–9 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n  In our constitutional tradition, freedom means that all\npersons have the right to believe or strive to believe in a\ndivine creator and a divine law. For those who choose this\n2         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ncourse, free exercise is essential in preserving their own\ndignity and in striving for a self-definition shaped by their\nreligious precepts. Free exercise in this sense implicates\nmore than just freedom of belief. See Cantwell v. Connect-\nicut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940). It means, too, the right\nto express those beliefs and to establish one’s religious\n(or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and\neconomic life of our larger community. But in a complex\nsociety and an era of pervasive governmental regulation,\ndefining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult.\nIn these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise\ntheir religious beliefs within the context of their own\nclosely held, for-profit corporations. They claim protection\nunder RFRA, the federal statute discussed with care and\nin detail in the Court’s opinion.\n  As the Court notes, under our precedents, RFRA imposes\na “ ‘stringent test.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U. S. 507, 533 (1997)). The Government must\ndemonstrate that the application of a substantial burden\nto a person’s exercise of religion “(1) is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).\n  As to RFRA’s first requirement, the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) makes the case that\nthe mandate serves the Government’s compelling interest\nin providing insurance coverage that is necessary to pro-\ntect the health of female employees, coverage that is sig-\nnificantly more costly than for a male employee. Ante, at\n39; see, e.g., Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, pp. 14–15.\nThere are many medical conditions for which pregnancy is\ncontraindicated. See, e.g., id., at 47. It is important to\nconfirm that a premise of the Court’s opinion is its as-\nsumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a\nlegitimate and compelling interest in the health of female\nemployees.

S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\n   But the Government has not made the second showing\nrequired by RFRA, that the means it uses to regulate is\nthe least restrictive way to further its interest. As the\nCourt’s opinion explains, the record in these cases\nshows that there is an existing, recognized, workable, and\nalready-implemented framework to provide coverage. That\nframework is one that HHS has itself devised, that the\nplaintiffs have not criticized with a specific objection that\nhas been considered in detail by the courts in this litiga-\ntion, and that is less restrictive than the means challenged\nby the plaintiffs in these cases. Ante, at 9–10, and n. 9,\n43–44.\n   The means the Government chose is the imposition of a\ndirect mandate on the employers in these cases. Ante, at\n8–9. But in other instances the Government has allowed\nthe same contraception coverage in issue here to be pro-\nvided to employees of nonprofit religious organizations, as\nan accommodation to the religious objections of those\nentities. See ante, at 9–10, and n. 9, 43–44. The accom-\nmodation works by requiring insurance companies to\ncover, without cost sharing, contraception coverage for\nfemale employees who wish it. That accommodation\nequally furthers the Government’s interest but does not\nimpinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See ante, at 44.\n   On this record and as explained by the Court, the Gov-\nernment has not met its burden of showing that it cannot\naccommodate the plaintiffs’ similar religious objections\nunder this established framework. RFRA is inconsis-\ntent with the insistence of an agency such as HHS on\ndistinguishing between different religious believers—bur-\ndening one while accommodating the other—when it\nmay treat both equally by offering both of them the same\naccommodation.\n   The parties who were the plaintiffs in the District\nCourts argue that the Government could pay for the\nmethods that are found objectionable.

In discussing this alternative,\nthe Court does not address whether the proper response to\na legitimate claim for freedom in the health care arena is\nfor the Government to create an additional program.\nAnte, at 41–43. The Court properly does not resolve\nwhether one freedom should be protected by creating\nincentives for additional government constraints. In these\ncases, it is the Court’s understanding that an accommoda-\ntion may be made to the employers without imposition of a\nwhole new program or burden on the Government. As the\nCourt makes clear, this is not a case where it can be estab-\nlished that it is difficult to accommodate the government’s\ninterest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is already\nin place.

S. ___, ___ (2014) (KAGAN, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 15). Among the reasons the United States is\nso open, so tolerant, and so free is that no person may be\nrestricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\nher religion. Yet neither may that same exercise unduly\nrestrict other persons, such as employees, in protecting\ntheir own interests, interests the law deems compelling.\nIn these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities\nare at hand in the existing accommodation the Govern-\nment has designed, identified, and used for circumstances\nclosely parallel to those presented here. RFRA requires\nthe Government to use this less restrictive means. As the\nCourt explains, this existing model, designed precisely for\nthis problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant\ncases from many others in which it is more difficult and\nexpensive to accommodate a governmental program to\ncountless religious claims based on an alleged statutory\nright of free exercise.

In the Court’s view, RFRA demands accommo-\ndation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no\nmatter the impact that accommodation may have on third\nparties who do not share the corporation owners’ religious\nfaith—in these cases, thousands of women employed by\nHobby Lobby and Conestoga or dependents of persons\nthose corporations employ.

In the end, however, the Court is not so sure. In\nstark contrast to the Court’s initial emphasis on this accommodation, it\nultimately declines to decide whether the highlighted accommodation is\neven lawful.

Carrying\nout Congress’ direction, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (HHS), in consultation with public health\nexperts, promulgated regulations requiring group health\nplans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA). The genesis of this\ncoverage should enlighten the Court’s resolution of these\ncases.\n                             A\n   The Affordable Care Act (ACA), in its initial form, speci-\nfied three categories of preventive care that health plans\nmust cover at no added cost to the plan participant or\nbeneficiary.2 Particular services were to be recommended\nby the U.

The scheme had a large gap, how-\never; it left out preventive services that “many women’s\nhealth advocates and medical professionals believe are\ncritically important.” 155 Cong. Rec. 28841 (2009) (state-\nment of Sen. Boxer). To correct this oversight, Senator\nBarbara Mikulski introduced the Women’s Health\nAmendment, which added to the ACA’s minimum coverage\nrequirements a new category of preventive services specific\nto women’s health.\n   Women paid significantly more than men for preventive\ncare, the amendment’s proponents noted; in fact, cost\n\n——————\n  2 See 42 U.

Mikulski) (“co-\npayments are [often] so high that [women] avoid getting\n[preventive and screening services] in the first place”).\nAnd increased access to contraceptive services, the spon-\nsors comprehended, would yield important public health\ngains. See, e.g., id., at 29768 (statement of Sen.

See also id.,\nat 102–110.\n   In making that recommendation, the IOM’s report\nexpressed concerns similar to those voiced by congres-\nsional proponents of the Women’s Health Amendment. The\nreport noted the disproportionate burden women carried\nfor comprehensive health services and the adverse health\nconsequences of excluding contraception from preventive\ncare available to employees without cost sharing. See,\ne.g., id., at 19 (“[W]omen are consistently more likely than\nmen to report a wide range of cost-related barriers to\nreceiving . . . medical tests and treatments and to filling\nprescriptions for themselves and their families.”); id., at\n103–104, 107 (pregnancy may be contraindicated for\nwomen with certain medical conditions, for example, some\ncongenital heart diseases, pulmonary hypertension, and\nMarfan syndrome, and contraceptives may be used to\nreduce risk of endometrial cancer, among other serious\nmedical conditions); id., at 103 (women with unintended\npregnancies are more likely to experience depression and\nanxiety, and their children face “increased odds of preterm\nbirth and low birth weight”).\n   In line with the IOM’s suggestions, the HRSA adopted\nguidelines recommending coverage of “[a]ll [FDA-]\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures,\nand patient education and counseling for all women with\nreproductive capacity.”4 Thereafter, HHS, the Depart-\nment of Labor, and the Department of Treasury promul-\ngated regulations requiring group health plans to include\ncoverage of the contraceptive services recommended in the\n——————\n  4 HRSA, HHS, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, available at\n\nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 27, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file),\nreprinted in App. to Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–354, pp. 43–44a.\nSee also 77 Fed.

The First Amendment is not offended, Smith held,\nwhen “prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the\nobject of [governmental regulation] but merely the inci-\ndental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid\nprovision.” Id., at 878; see id., at 878–879 (“an individ-\nual’s religious beliefs [do not] excuse him from compliance\nwith an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the\nState is free to regulate”). The ACA’s contraceptive cover-\nage requirement applies generally, it is “otherwise valid,”\nit trains on women’s well being, not on the exercise\nof religion, and any effect it has on such exercise is\nincidental.\n  Even if Smith did not control, the Free Exercise Clause\nwould not require the exemption Hobby Lobby and Cones-\ntoga seek.

See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–111, p. 12 (1993)\n(hereinafter Senate Report) (RFRA’s purpose was “only to\noverturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith,” not to\n“unsettle other areas of the law.”); 139 Cong. Rec. 26178\n(1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (RFRA was “designed\nto restore the compelling interest test for deciding free\nexercise claims.”). In line with this restorative purpose,\nCongress expected courts considering RFRA claims to\n“look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for\nguidance.” Senate Report 8. See also H. R. Rep.

See ante, at 6, n. 3, 7,\n17, 25–27. To support its conception of RFRA as a meas-\nure detached from this Court’s decisions, one that sets a\nnew course, the Court points first to the Religious Land\nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),\n42 U. S. C. §2000cc et seq., which altered RFRA’s defini-\ntion of the term “exercise of religion.” RFRA, as originally\nenacted, defined that term to mean “the exercise of reli-\ngion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”\n§2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). See ante, at 6–7. As amended by\nRLUIPA, RFRA’s definition now includes “any exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief.” §2000bb–2(4) (2012 ed.) (cross-\nreferencing §2000cc–5). That definitional change, accord-\ning to the Court, reflects “an obvious effort to effect a\ncomplete separation from First Amendment case law.”\nAnte, at 7.\n   The Court’s reading is not plausible. RLUIPA’s altera-\ntion clarifies that courts should not question the centrality\nof a particular religious exercise. But the amendment in\nno way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class\nof entities qualified to mount religious accommodation\nclaims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to in-\nquire whether a government action substantially burdens\na religious exercise. See Rasul v. Myers, 563 F. 3d 527,\n535 (CADC 2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (“There is no\ndoubt that RLUIPA’s drafters, in changing the definition\nof ‘exercise of religion,’ wanted to broaden the scope of the\nkinds of practices protected by RFRA, not increase the\nuniverse of individuals protected by RFRA.”); H.

Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997)). See also ante, at 6,\nn. 3. But as RFRA’s statements of purpose and legislative\nhistory make clear, Congress intended only to restore, not\nto scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had\napplied it pre-Smith. See supra, at 8–9. See also Senate\nReport 9 (RFRA’s “compelling interest test generally\nshould not be construed more stringently or more leniently\nthan it was prior to Smith.”); House Report 7 (same).\n  The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this\nCourt’s pre-Smith case law as including within the “com-\npelling interest test” a “least restrictive means” require-\nment.

S. C. §2000cc–3(g); see ante, at\n6–7, 26.

And the view that\nthe pre-Smith test included a “least restrictive means”\nrequirement had been aired in testimony before the Sen-\nate Judiciary Committee by experts on religious freedom.\nSee, e.g., Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 78–79 (1993)\n(statement of Prof. Douglas Laycock).\n   Our decision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the\nleast restrictive means requirement “was not used in the\npre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.” See\nante, at 6, n. 3, 17, n. 18. As just indicated, however, that\nstatement does not accurately convey the Court’s pre-\nSmith jurisprudence. See Sherbert, 374 U.

That task, in\nview of the positions taken by the Court, requires consid-\neration of several questions, each potentially dispositive of\nHobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s claims: Do for-profit corpo-\nrations rank among “person[s]” who “exercise . . . reli-\ngion”? Assuming that they do, does the contraceptive\ncoverage requirement “substantially burden” their reli-\ngious exercise? If so, is the requirement “in furtherance of\na compelling government interest”? And last, does the\nrequirement represent the least restrictive means for\nfurthering that interest?\n  Misguided by its errant premise that RFRA moved\nbeyond the pre-Smith case law, the Court falters at each\nstep of its analysis.\n                             1\n   RFRA’s compelling interest test, as noted, see supra, at\n8, applies to government actions that “substantially bur-\nden a person’s exercise of religion.” 42 U.

There is in that case law no\nsupport for the notion that free exercise rights pertain to\nfor-profit corporations.\n  Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized\na for-profit corporation’s qualification for a religious ex-\nemption from a generally applicable law, whether under\nthe Free Exercise Clause or RFRA.13 The absence of such\nprecedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of\nreligion is characteristic of natural persons, not artificial\nlegal entities.

The suggestion is barely there. True, one of the five\nchallengers to the Sunday closing law assailed in Gallagher was a\ncorporation owned by four Orthodox Jews.

Accordingly, the plurality stated it could pretermit the question\n“whether appellees ha[d] standing” because Braunfeld v. Brown, 366\nU.

Board of Equalization of Cal., 493 U. S. 378 (1990).\n   15 Typically, Congress has accorded to organizations religious in char-\n\nacter religion-based exemptions from statutes of general application.\nE.g., 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1(a) (Title VII exemption from prohibition\nagainst employment discrimination based on religion for “a religious\ncorporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect\nto the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform\nwork connected with the carrying on . . . of its activities”); 42 U. S. C.\n§12113(d)(1) (parallel exemption in Americans With Disabilities Act of\n1990). It can scarcely be maintained that RFRA enlarges these exemp-\ntions to allow Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to hire only persons who\nshare the religious beliefs of the Greens or Hahns. Nor does the Court\nsuggest otherwise. Cf. ante, at 28.\n   The Court does identify two statutory exemptions it reads to cover\nfor-profit corporations, 42 U. S. C. §§300a–7(b)(2) and 238n(a), and\ninfers from them that “Congress speaks with specificity when it intends\na religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit corporations,”\nante, at 28. The Court’s inference is unwarranted. The exemptions the\nCourt cites cover certain medical personnel who object to performing or\nassisting with abortions. Cf. ante, at 28, n. 27 (“the protection provided\nby §238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by\n16           BURWELL v.

Not so of for-profit corporations.\nWorkers who sustain the operations of those corporations\ncommonly are not drawn from one religious community.\nIndeed, by law, no religion-based criterion can restrict the\n\n——————\nRFRA”). Notably, the Court does not assert that these exemptions have\nin fact been afforded to for-profit corporations. See §238n(c) (“health\ncare entity” covered by exemption is a term defined to include “an\nindividual physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a\nparticipant in a program of training in the health professions”); Tozzi,\nWhither Free Exercise: Employment Division v. Smith and the Rebirth\nof State Constitutional Free Exercise Clause Jurisprudence?, 48 J.\nCatholic Legal Studies 269, 296, n. 133 (2009) (“Catholic physicians,\nbut not necessarily hospitals, . . . may be able to invoke [§238n(a)]\n. . . .”); cf. S. 137, 113th Cong., 1st Sess. (2013) (as introduced) (Abortion\nNon-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would amend the definition of\n“health care entity” in §238n to include “hospital[s],” “health insurance\nplan[s],” and other health care facilities). These provisions are reveal-\ning in a way that detracts from one of the Court’s main arguments.\nThey show that Congress is not content to rest on the Dictionary Act\nwhen it wishes to ensure that particular entities are among those\neligible for a religious accommodation.\n    Moreover, the exemption codified in §238n(a) was not enacted until\nthree years after RFRA’s passage. See Omnibus Consolidated Rescis-\nsions and Appropriations Act of 1996, §515, 110 Stat. 1321–245. If, as\nthe Court believes, RFRA opened all statutory schemes to religion-\nbased challenges by for-profit corporations, there would be no need for a\nstatute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.\n    16 That is not to say that a category of plaintiffs, such as resident\n\naliens, may bring RFRA claims only if this Court expressly “addressed\ntheir [free-exercise] rights before Smith.” Ante, at 27. Continuing with\nthe Court’s example, resident aliens, unlike corporations, are flesh-and-\nblood individuals who plainly count as persons sheltered by the First\nAmendment, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 271\n(1990) (citing Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135, 148 (1945)), and\na fortiori, RFRA.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

S. 63, 80–81 (1977) (Title\nVII requires reasonable accommodation of an employee’s\nreligious exercise, but such accommodation must not come\n“at the expense of other[ employees]”). The distinction\nbetween a community made up of believers in the same\nreligion and one embracing persons of diverse beliefs, clear\nas it is, constantly escapes the Court’s attention.17 One\ncan only wonder why the Court shuts this key difference\nfrom sight.\n   Reading RFRA, as the Court does, to require extension\nof religion-based exemptions to for-profit corporations\nsurely is not grounded in the pre-Smith precedent Con-\ngress sought to preserve. Had Congress intended RFRA to\ninitiate a change so huge, a clarion statement to that\neffect likely would have been made in the legislation. See\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n468 (2001) (Congress does not “hide elephants in mouse-\nholes”). The text of RFRA makes no such statement and\nthe legislative history does not so much as mention for-\nprofit corporations.

For-profit corporations\ndo not fit that bill. Moreover, history is not on the Court’s\nside. Recognition of the discrete characters of “ecclesiasti-\ncal and lay” corporations dates back to Blackstone, see 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 458\n(1765), and was reiterated by this Court centuries before\nthe enactment of the Internal Revenue Code. See Terrett\nv.

See also ante, at 16–17. But even\naccepting, arguendo, the premise that unincorporated\nbusiness enterprises may gain religious accommodations\nunder the Free Exercise Clause, the Court’s conclusion is\nunsound. In a sole proprietorship, the business and its\nowner are one and the same. By incorporating a business,\nhowever, an individual separates herself from the entity\nand escapes personal responsibility for the entity’s obliga-\ntions. One might ask why the separation should hold only\nwhen it serves the interest of those who control the corpo-\nration. In any event, Braunfeld is hardly impressive\nauthority for the entitlement Hobby Lobby and Conestoga\nseek. The free exercise claim asserted there was promptly\nrejected on the merits.\n   The Court’s determination that RFRA extends to for-\nprofit corporations is bound to have untoward effects.\nAlthough the Court attempts to cabin its language to\nclosely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations\nof any size, public or private.19 Little doubt that RFRA\n——————\n  19 The Court does not even begin to explain how one might go about\nascertaining the religious scruples of a corporation where shares are\nsold to the public. No need to speculate on that, the Court says, for “it\nseems unlikely” that large corporations “will often assert RFRA\nclaims.” Ante, at 29. Perhaps so, but as Hobby Lobby’s case demon-\nstrates, such claims are indeed pursued by large corporations, employ-\ning thousands of persons of different faiths, whose ownership is not\ndiffuse. “Closely held” is not synonymous with “small.” Hobby Lobby is\n20          BURWELL v.

S. C.\n§2000bb–1(a). Congress no doubt meant the modifier\n“substantially” to carry weight. In the original draft of\nRFRA, the word “burden” appeared unmodified. The word\n“substantially” was inserted pursuant to a clarifying\namendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Hatch. See\n——————\nhardly the only enterprise of sizable scale that is family owned or\nclosely held. For example, the family-owned candy giant Mars, Inc.,\ntakes in $33 billion in revenues and has some 72,000 employees, and\nclosely held Cargill, Inc., takes in more than $136 billion in reve-\nnues and employs some 140,000 persons. See Forbes, America’s Larg-\nest Private Companies 2013, available at http://www.forbes.com/\nlargest-private-companies/.\n   Nor does the Court offer any instruction on how to resolve the dis-\nputes that may crop up among corporate owners over religious values\nand accommodations. The Court is satisfied that “[s]tate corporate law\nprovides a ready means for resolving any conflicts,” ante, at 30, but the\nauthorities cited in support of that proposition are hardly helpful. See\nDel. Code Ann., Tit. 8, §351 (2011) (certificates of incorporation may\nspecify how the business is managed); 1 J. Cox & T.

In proposing the amendment,\nSenator Kennedy stated that RFRA, in accord with the\nCourt’s pre-Smith case law, “does not require the Govern-\nment to justify every action that has some effect on reli-\ngious exercise.” Ibid.\n  The Court barely pauses to inquire whether any burden\nimposed by the contraceptive coverage requirement is\nsubstantial. Instead, it rests on the Greens’ and Hahns’\n“belie[f ] that providing the coverage demanded by the\nHHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an\nembryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for\nthem to provide the coverage.” Ante, at 36.20 I agree with\nthe Court that the Green and Hahn families’ religious\nconvictions regarding contraception are sincerely held.\nSee Thomas, 450 U. S., at 715 (courts are not to question\nwhere an individual “dr[aws] the line” in defining which\npractices run afoul of her religious beliefs). See also 42\nU. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), 2000bb–2(4), 2000cc–5(7)(A).21\nBut those beliefs, however deeply held, do not suffice to\nsustain a RFRA claim. RFRA, properly understood, dis-\ntinguishes between “factual allegations that [plaintiffs’]\n——————\n   20 The Court dismisses the argument, advanced by some amici, that\n\nthe $2,000-per-employee tax charged to certain employers that fail to\nprovide health insurance is less than the average cost of offering health\ninsurance, noting that the Government has not provided the statistics\nthat could support such an argument. See ante, at 32–34. The Court\noverlooks, however, that it is not the Government’s obligation to prove\nthat an asserted burden is insubstantial. Instead, it is incumbent upon\nplaintiffs to demonstrate, in support of a RFRA claim, the substantial-\nity of the alleged burden.\n   21 The Court levels a criticism that is as wrongheaded as can be. In\n\nno way does the dissent “tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.”\nAnte, at 37. Right or wrong in this domain is a judgment no Member of\nthis Court, or any civil court, is authorized or equipped to make.

Kaemmerling v.\nLappin, 553 F. 3d 669, 679 (CADC 2008).\n   That distinction is a facet of the pre-Smith jurispru-\ndence RFRA incorporates. Bowen v. Roy, 476 U. S. 693\n(1986), is instructive. There, the Court rejected a free\nexercise challenge to the Government’s use of a Native\nAmerican child’s Social Security number for purposes of\nadministering benefit programs. Without questioning the\nsincerity of the father’s religious belief that “use of [his\ndaughter’s Social Security] number may harm [her] spirit,”\nthe Court concluded that the Government’s internal\nuses of that number “place[d] [no] restriction on what [the\nfather] may believe or what he may do.” Id., at 699.\nRecognizing that the father’s “religious views may not\naccept” the position that the challenged uses concerned\nonly the Government’s internal affairs, the Court ex-\nplained that “for the adjudication of a constitutional claim,\nthe Constitution, rather than an individual’s religion,\nmust supply the frame of reference.” Id., at 700–701, n. 6.\nSee also Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680, 699\n(1989) (distinguishing between, on the one hand, “ques-\ntion[s] [of] the centrality of particular beliefs or practices\nto a faith, or the validity of particular litigants’ interpreta-\ntions of those creeds,” and, on the other, “whether the\nalleged burden imposed [by the challenged government\naction] is a substantial one”). Inattentive to this guidance,\ntoday’s decision elides entirely the distinction between the\nsincerity of a challenger’s religious belief and the substan-\ntiality of the burden placed on the challenger.\n   Undertaking the inquiry that the Court forgoes, I would\nconclude that the connection between the families’ reli-\ngious objections and the contraceptive coverage require-\nment is too attenuated to rank as substantial.

Instead, it calls on the companies covered\nby the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated\nfunds that finance a wide variety of benefits under com-\nprehensive health plans. Those plans, in order to comply\nwith the ACA, see supra, at 3–6, must offer contraceptive\ncoverage without cost sharing, just as they must cover an\narray of other preventive services.\n  Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits\nunder the plans are made not by Hobby Lobby or Cones-\ntoga, but by the covered employees and dependents, in\nconsultation with their health care providers. Should an\nemployee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious\nbeliefs of the Greens and Hahns, she is of course under no\ncompulsion to use the contraceptives in question. But\n“[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physi-\ncian—be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or have\na hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense [her employ-\ner’s] decision or action.” Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F. 3d 850,\n865 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J., dissenting). It is doubtful that\nCongress, when it specified that burdens must be “sub-\nstantia[l],” had in mind a linkage thus interrupted by\nindependent decisionmakers (the woman and her health\ncounselor) standing between the challenged government\naction and the religious exercise claimed to be infringed.\nAny decision to use contraceptives made by a woman\ncovered under Hobby Lobby’s or Conestoga’s plan will not\nbe propelled by the Government, it will be the wo-\nman’s autonomous choice, informed by the physician she\nconsults.\n                          3\n  Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and\nConestoga meet the substantial burden requirement, the\nGovernment has shown that the contraceptive coverage\n24          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfor which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests\nin public health and women’s well being. Those interests\nare concrete, specific, and demonstrated by a wealth of\nempirical evidence. To recapitulate, the mandated contra-\nception coverage enables women to avoid the health prob-\nlems unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their\nchildren. See IOM Report 102–107. The coverage helps\nsafeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may\nbe hazardous, even life threatening. See Brief for Ameri-\ncan College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as\nAmici Curiae 14–15. And the mandate secures benefits\nwholly unrelated to pregnancy, preventing certain cancers,\nmenstrual disorders, and pelvic pain.

Reg. 39872 (2013); IOM Report 107.\n   That Hobby Lobby and Conestoga resist coverage for\nonly 4 of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives does not\nlessen these compelling interests. Notably, the corpora-\ntions exclude intrauterine devices (IUDs), devices signifi-\ncantly more effective, and significantly more expensive\nthan other contraceptive methods. See id., at 105.22\nMoreover, the Court’s reasoning appears to permit com-\nmercial enterprises like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to\nexclude from their group health plans all forms of contra-\nceptives.

See ante, at 39–40.\n   Federal statutes often include exemptions for small\nemployers, and such provisions have never been held to\nundermine the interests served by these statutes. See,\ne.g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U. S. C.\n§2611(4)(A)(i) (applicable to employers with 50 or more\nemployees); Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967, 29 U. S.

Once speci-\nfied changes are made, grandfathered status ceases. See\n45 CFR §147.140(g). Hobby Lobby’s own situation is\nillustrative. By the time this litigation commenced, Hobby\nLobby did not have grandfathered status. Asked why by\nthe District Court, Hobby Lobby’s counsel explained that\nthe “grandfathering requirements mean that you can’t\nmake a whole menu of changes to your plan that involve\nthings like the amount of co-pays, the amount of co-\ninsurance, deductibles, that sort of thing.” App. in No. 13–\n354, pp. 39–40.

In short, far from\nranking as a categorical exemption, the grandfathering\nprovision is “temporary, intended to be a means for gradu-\nally transitioning employers into mandatory coverage.”\nGilardi, 733 F. 3d, at 1241 (Edwards, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part).\n   The Court ultimately acknowledges a critical point:\nRFRA’s application “must take adequate account of the\nburdens a requested accommodation may impose on non-\nbeneficiaries.” Ante, at 42, n. 37 (quoting Cutter v. Wil­\nkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 720 (2005); emphasis added). No\ntradition, and no prior decision under RFRA, allows a\nreligion-based exemption when the accommodation would\nbe harmful to others—here, the very persons the contra-\nceptive coverage requirement was designed to protect. Cf.\nsupra, at 7–8; Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.

But the Government has shown that there is no less\nrestrictive, equally effective means that would both (1)\nsatisfy the challengers’ religious objections to providing\n——————\nstates that, “[g]iven the nature of employers’ needs to meet changing\neconomic and staffing circumstances, and to adjust insurance coverage\naccordingly, the actual benefit of the ‘grandfather’ exclusion is de\nminimis and transitory at best.” Brief for National Religious Broad-\ncasters as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–354, p. 28.\n28           BURWELL v.

A “least restrictive means” cannot require employ-\nees to relinquish benefits accorded them by federal law in\norder to ensure that their commercial employers can\nadhere unreservedly to their religious tenets. See supra,\nat 7–8, 27.25\n  Then let the government pay (rather than the employees\nwho do not share their employer’s faith), the Court sug-\ngests. “The most straightforward [alternative],” the Court\nasserts, “would be for the Government to assume the cost\nof providing . . . contraceptives . . . to any women who are\nunable to obtain them under their health-insurance poli-\ncies due to their employers’ religious objections.” Ante, at\n41.

Note, too, that Congress declined to write into law the\npreferential treatment Hobby Lobby and Conestoga de-\nscribe as a less restrictive alternative. See supra, at 6.\n  And where is the stopping point to the “let the govern-\nment pay” alternative? Suppose an employer’s sincerely\nheld religious belief is offended by health coverage of\nvaccines, or paying the minimum wage, see Tony and\nSusan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor, 471 U. S.\n290, 303 (1985), or according women equal pay for sub-\nstantially similar work, see Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist\nChurch, 899 F. 2d 1389, 1392 (CA4 1990)? Does it rank as\na less restrictive alternative to require the government to\nprovide the money or benefit to which the employer has\na religion-based objection?26 Because the Court cannot\neasily answer that question, it proposes something else:\nExtension to commercial enterprises of the accommodation\nalready afforded to nonprofit religion-based organizations.\nSee ante, at 3–4, 9–10, 43–45. “At a minimum,” according\nto the Court, such an approach would not “impinge on\n[Hobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s] religious belief.” Ante, at\n44. I have already discussed the “special solicitude” gen-\nerally accorded nonprofit religion-based organizations that\nexist to serve a community of believers, solicitude never\nbefore accorded to commercial enterprises comprising\nemployees of diverse faiths.

Counsel for Hobby\nLobby was similarly noncommittal. Asked at oral argu-\nment whether the Court-proposed alternative was ac-\nceptable,27 counsel responded: “We haven’t been offered\nthat accommodation, so we haven’t had to decide what\nkind of objection, if any, we would make to that.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 86–87.\n   Conestoga suggests that, if its employees had to acquire\nand pay for the contraceptives (to which the corporation\nobjects) on their own, a tax credit would qualify as a less\nrestrictive alternative. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–\n356, p. 64. A tax credit, of course, is one variety of “let the\ngovernment pay.” In addition to departing from the exist-\ning employer-based system of health insurance, Conesto-\nga’s alternative would require a woman to reach into her\nown pocket in the first instance, and it would do nothing\nfor the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.\n   In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish,\n——————\n  27 On brief, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga barely addressed the exten-\nsion solution, which would bracket commercial enterprises with non-\nprofit religion-based organizations for religious accommodations pur-\nposes. The hesitation is understandable, for challenges to the adequacy\nof the accommodation accorded religious nonprofit organizations are\ncurrently sub judice. See, e.g., Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\nAged v. Sebelius, ___ F.

At\nanother point in today’s decision, the Court refuses to consider an\nargument neither “raised below [nor] advanced in this Court by any\nparty,” giving Hobby Lobby and Conestoga “[no] opportunity to respond\nto [that] novel claim.” Ante, at 33. Yet the Court is content to decide\nthis case (and this case only) on the ground that HHS could make an\naccommodation never suggested in the parties’ presentations. RFRA\ncannot sensibly be read to “requir[e] the government to . . . refute each\nand every conceivable alternative regulation,” United States v.

Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982).\nLee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry,\nwas a member of the Old Order Amish. He sincerely\nbelieved that withholding Social Security taxes from his\nemployees or paying the employer’s share of such taxes\nwould violate the Amish faith. This Court held that,\nalthough the obligations imposed by the Social Security\nsystem conflicted with Lee’s religious beliefs, the burden\nwas not unconstitutional. Id., at 260–261. See also id., at\n258 (recognizing the important governmental interest in\nproviding a “nationwide . . . comprehensive insurance\nsystem with a variety of benefits available to all partici-\npants, with costs shared by employers and employees”).28\nThe Government urges that Lee should control the chal-\nlenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. See Brief\nfor Respondents in No. 13–356, p. 18. In contrast, today’s\nCourt dismisses Lee as a tax case. See ante, at 46–47.\nIndeed, it was a tax case and the Court in Lee homed in on\n“[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate religious\nbeliefs in the area of taxation.” 455 U. S., at 259.\n   But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot\nconfine to tax cases. “When followers of a particular sect\nenter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,” the\nCourt observed, “the limits they accept on their own con-\nduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\n——————\n  28 Asa sole proprietor, Lee was subject to personal liability for violat-\ning the law of general application he opposed. His claim to a religion-\nbased exemption would have been even thinner had he conducted his\nbusiness as a corporation, thus avoiding personal liability.\n32           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsuperimposed on statutory schemes which are binding on\nothers in that activity.” Id., at 261. The statutory scheme\nof employer-based comprehensive health coverage in-\nvolved in these cases is surely binding on others engaged\nin the same trade or business as the corporate challengers\nhere, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Further, the Court\nrecognized in Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption\nto a commercial employer would “operat[e] to impose the\nemployer’s religious faith on the employees.” Ibid.29 No\ndoubt the Greens and Hahns and all who share their\nbeliefs may decline to acquire for themselves the contra-\nceptives in question. But that choice may not be imposed\non employees who hold other beliefs. Working for Hobby\nLobby or Conestoga, in other words, should not deprive\nemployees of the preventive care available to workers at\nthe shop next door,30 at least in the absence of directions\nfrom the Legislature or Administration to do so.\n   Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress\nor the regulatory authority, and not this Court? Hobby\nLobby and Conestoga surely do not stand alone as com-\nmercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally\napplicable laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. See,\ne.g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 256 F. Supp.\n——————\n  29 Congress  amended the Social Security Act in response to Lee. The\namended statute permits Amish sole proprietors and partnerships (but\nnot Amish-owned corporations) to obtain an exemption from the obliga-\ntion to pay Social Security taxes only for employees who are co-\nreligionists and who likewise seek an exemption and agree to give up\ntheir Social Security benefits. See 26 U. S. C. §3127(a)(2), (b)(1). Thus,\nemployers with sincere religious beliefs have no right to a religion-\nbased exemption that would deprive employees of Social Security\nbenefits without the employee’s consent—an exemption analogous to\nthe one Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek here.\n   30 Cf. Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor, 471\n\nU.

Not much help there for the lower courts bound by\ntoday’s decision.\n   The Court, however, sees nothing to worry about. To-\nday’s cases, the Court concludes, are “concerned solely\nwith the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not\nbe understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate\nmust necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s\nreligious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as\nimmunizations, may be supported by different interests\n(for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious\ndiseases) and may involve different arguments about the\nleast restrictive means of providing them.” Ante, at 46.\nBut the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the\ninterest in women’s health and well being is compelling\nand has come up with no means adequate to serve that\ninterest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Wom-\nen’s Health Amendment.\n   There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the\ncourts “out of the business of evaluating the relative mer-\nits of differing religious claims,” Lee, 455 U. S., at 263, n. 2\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or the sincerity with\nwhich an asserted religious belief is held.

HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC., \n\n                       ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 13–354.      Argued March 25, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014*\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the\n  “Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a person’s exercise of\n  religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicabil-\n  ity” unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the\n  burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling govern-\n  mental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering\n  that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a),\n  (b). As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\n  Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers “any exercise of religion,\n  whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious be-\n  lief.” §2000cc–5(7)(A).\n     At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of\n  Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and\n  Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires\n  specified employers’ group health plans to furnish “preventive care\n  and screenings” for women without “any cost sharing requirements,”\n  42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4). Congress did not specify what types of\n  preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources\n  and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide.

HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    istration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an\n    already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its\n    attachment to the uterus. Religious employers, such as churches, are\n    exempt from this contraceptive mandate. HHS has also effectively\n    exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections\n    to providing coverage for contraceptive services. Under this accom-\n    modation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage\n    from the employer’s plan and provide plan participants with separate\n    payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-\n    sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its em-\n    ployee beneficiaries.\n       In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corpora-\n    tions have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and\n    that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive\n    drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions,\n    they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively\n    HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin\n    application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them\n    to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.\n    In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their compa-\n    ny—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction. Affirm-\n    ing, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “en-\n    gage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the First Amendment, and\n    that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their\n    personal capacity. In No. 13–354, the Greens, their children, and\n    their companies—Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel—were also denied\n    a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that\n    the Greens’ businesses are “persons” under RFRA, and that the cor-\n    porations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim\n    because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their ex-\n    ercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling inter-\n    est in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the\n    court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the “least\n    restrictive means” of furthering a compelling governmental interest.\nHeld: As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations im-\n posing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA. Pp. 16–49.\n    (a) RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely\n held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mar-\n del. Pp. 16–31.\n      (1) HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are\n for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the\n regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave mer-\n chants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protec-\n tion of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as cor-\n                    Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nporations. RFRA’s text shows that Congress designed the statute to\nprovide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend\nto put merchants to such a choice. It employed the familiar legal fic-\ntion of including corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons,”\nbut the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the\nrights of people associated with the corporation, including sharehold-\ners, officers, and employees. Protecting the free-exercise rights of\nclosely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the\nhumans who own and control them. Pp. 16–19.\n     (2) HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments.\nPp. 19–31.\n        (i) Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart\nfrom the Dictionary Act definition of “person,” which “include[s] cor-\nporations, . . . as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1. The Court has\nentertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit cor-\nporations. See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficiente União\ndo Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418. And HHS’s concession that a nonprofit\ncorporation can be a “person” under RFRA effectively dispatches any\nargument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no\nconceivable definition of “person” includes natural persons and non-\nprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations. Pp. 19–20.\n        (ii) HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does\nnot cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot\n“exercise . . . religion.” They offer no persuasive explanation for this\nconclusion. The corporate form alone cannot explain it because\nRFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations. And the profit-\nmaking objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the\nCourt has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who\nwere attempting to make a profit as retail merchants. Braunfeld v.\nBrown, 366 U. S. 599. Business practices compelled or limited by the\ntenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understand-\ning of the “exercise of religion” that this Court set out in Employment\nDiv., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877.\nAny suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercis-\ning religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in\nthe face of modern corporate law. States, including those in which\nthe plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations\nto pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of\nprofit in conformity with the owners’ religious principles. Pp. 20–25.\n        (iii) Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection be-\ncause it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents,\nnone of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit\ncorporations. First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested\nthat its definition of “exercise of religion” was meant to be tied to pre-\n4              BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Smith interpretations of the First Amendment. Second, if RFRA’s\n    original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely\n    dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of\n    the phrase from that in First Amendment case law. Third, the pre-\n    Smith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,\n    366 U. S. 617, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can\n    exercise religion. Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law\n    enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely\n    restored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and re-\n    stricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plain-\n    tiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith. Pp. 25–28.\n          (3) Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted\n    RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of\n    ascertaining the “beliefs” of large, publicly traded corporations, but\n    HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation\n    asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would like-\n    ly prevent that from occurring. HHS has also provided no evidence\n    that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an assert-\n    ed religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations\n    from RFRA’s protection. That disputes among the owners of corpora-\n    tions might arise is not a problem unique to this context. State cor-\n    porate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for\n    example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing\n    structure. Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state\n    law in resolving disputes. Pp. 29–31.\n       (b) HHS’s contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exer-\n    cise of religion. Pp. 31–38.\n          (1) It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that\n    seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at con-\n    ception. If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive\n    coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million\n    per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and\n    $15 million per year for Mardel. And if they drop coverage altogeth-\n    er, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby,\n    $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel. P. 32.\n          (2) Amici supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee\n    penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and\n    therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substan-\n    tial burden imposed by the mandate. HHS has never argued this and\n    the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.\n    But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unper-\n    suasive: It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons\n    for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is\n    far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insur-\n                   Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and pay-\ning the ACA penalty. Pp. 32–35.\n      (3) HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting\nparties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too\nattenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage\nand contraceptive method she uses. But RFRA’s question is whether\nthe mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties’\nability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.\nThe belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and im-\nportant question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the cir-\ncumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act\nthat is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facili-\ntating the commission of an immoral act by another. It is not for the\nCourt to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or\nunreasonable. In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly\nidentical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment\nSecurity Div., 450 U. S. 707. The Court’s “narrow function . . . is to\ndetermine” whether the plaintiffs’ asserted religious belief reflects\n“an honest conviction,” id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it\ndoes. Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 689; and Board of Ed. of\nCentral School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 248–249, distin-\nguished. Pp. 35–38.\n   (c) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free\naccess to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling\ngovernmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that\nthe contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering\nthat interest. Pp. 38–49.\n      (1) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free\naccess to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling\nwithin the meaning of RFRA. Pp. 39–40.\n      (2) The Government has failed to satisfy RFRA’s least-\nrestrictive-means standard. HHS has not shown that it lacks other\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion. The Government could, e.g., as-\nsume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable\nto obtain coverage due to their employers’ religious objections. Or it\ncould extend the accommodation that HHS has already established\nfor religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with re-\nligious objections to the contraceptive mandate. That accommodation\ndoes not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that providing in-\nsurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their\nreligion and it still serves HHS’s stated interests. Pp. 40–45.\n      (3) This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and\nshould not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage man-\n6             BURWELL v.

Nor does it\n    provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination\n    as a religious practice. United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, which up-\n    held the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employer’s reli-\n    gious objection, is not analogous. It turned primarily on the special\n    problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee\n    were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is\n    no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay\n    taxes. Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.\n    Pp. 45–49.\nNo. 13–354, 723 F. 3d 1114, affirmed; No. 13–356, 724 F. 3d 377, re-\n versed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §2000bb et seq., permits the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to\ndemand that three closely held corporations provide\nhealth-insurance coverage for methods of contraception\nthat violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the\ncompanies’ owners. We hold that the regulations that\nimpose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the\n2         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal Government from taking any action that substan-\ntially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compel-\nling government interest.\n   In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject\nHHS’s argument that the owners of the companies for-\nfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize\ntheir businesses as corporations rather than sole proprie-\ntorships or general partnerships. The plain terms of\nRFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not dis-\ncriminate in this way against men and women who wish to\nrun their businesses as for-profit corporations in the man-\nner required by their religious beliefs.\n   Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide\nwhether the challenged HHS regulations substantially\nburden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do.\nThe owners of the businesses have religious objections to\nabortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four\ncontraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the\nowners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they\nwill be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply,\nthey will pay a very heavy price—as much as $1.3 million\nper day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one\nof the companies. If these consequences do not amount to\na substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.\n   Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise must serve a\ncompelling government interest, and we assume that the\nHHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order\nfor the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also consti-\ntute the least restrictive means of serving that interest,\nand the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other\nways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that\nevery woman has cost-free access to the particular contra-\nceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives.\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a\nsystem that seeks to respect the religious liberty of reli-\ngious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the em-\nployees of these entities have precisely the same access to\nall FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of compa-\nnies whose owners have no religious objections to provid-\ning such coverage. The employees of these religious non-\nprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage\nwithout cost sharing for all FDA-approved contracep-\ntives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net\neconomic burden on the insurance companies that are\nrequired to provide or secure the coverage.\n   Although HHS has made this system available to reli-\ngious nonprofits that have religious objections to the con-\ntraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the\nsame system cannot be made available when the owners of\nfor-profit corporations have similar religious objections.\nWe therefore conclude that this system constitutes an\nalternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims\nwhile providing greater respect for religious liberty. And\nunder RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of\nthe HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting\nparties in these cases is unlawful.\n   As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding\nis very specific. We do not hold, as the principal dissent\nalleges, that for-profit corporations and other commercial\nenterprises can “opt out of any law (saving only tax laws)\nthey judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs.” Post, at 1 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Nor do we\nhold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have\nfree rein to take steps that impose “disadvantages . . . on\nothers” or that require “the general public [to] pick up the\ntab.” Post, at 1–2. And we certainly do not hold or suggest\nthat “RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corpo-\nration’s religious beliefs no matter the impact that ac-\ncommodation may have on . . . thousands of women em-\n4           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nployed by Hobby Lobby.” Post, at 2.1 The effect of the\nHHS-created accommodation on the women employed by\nHobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these\ncases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation,\nthese women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives without cost sharing.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very\nbroad protection for religious liberty. RFRA’s enactment\ncame three years after this Court’s decision in Employ­\nment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494\nU. S. 872 (1990), which largely repudiated the method of\nanalyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in cases\nlike Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), and Wiscon­\nsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972). In determining whether\nchallenged government actions violated the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment, those decisions used a\nbalancing test that took into account whether the chal-\nlenged action imposed a substantial burden on the prac-\ntice of religion, and if it did, whether it was needed to\nserve a compelling government interest. Applying this\ntest, the Court held in Sherbert that an employee who was\nfired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be\ndenied unemployment benefits. 374 U. S., at 408–409.\nAnd in Yoder, the Court held that Amish children could\nnot be required to comply with a state law demanding that\nthey remain in school until the age of 16 even though their\nreligion required them to focus on uniquely Amish values\nand beliefs during their formative adolescent years. 406\nU. S., at 210–211, 234–236.\n   In Smith, however, the Court rejected “the balancing\n——————\n  1 See also post, at 8 (“The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and\n\nConestoga . . . would deny [their employees] access to contraceptive\ncoverage that the ACA would otherwise secure”)\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntest set forth in Sherbert.” 494 U. S., at 883. Smith con-\ncerned two members of the Native American Church who\nwere fired for ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes.\nWhen they sought unemployment benefits, the State of\nOregon rejected their claims on the ground that consump-\ntion of peyote was a crime, but the Oregon Supreme Court,\napplying the Sherbert test, held that the denial of benefits\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. 494 U. S., at 875.\n   This Court then reversed, observing that use of the\nSherbert test whenever a person objected on religious\ngrounds to the enforcement of a generally applicable law\n“would open the prospect of constitutionally required\nreligious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every\nconceivable kind.” 494 U. S., at 888. The Court therefore\nheld that, under the First Amendment, “neutral, generally\napplicable laws may be applied to religious practices even\nwhen not supported by a compelling governmental inter-\nest.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 514 (1997).\n   Congress responded to Smith by enacting RFRA.\n“[L]aws [that are] ‘neutral’ toward religion,” Congress\nfound, “may burden religious exercise as surely as laws\nintended to interfere with religious exercise.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb(a)(2); see also §2000bb(a)(4). In order to ensure\nbroad protection for religious liberty, RFRA provides that\n“Government shall not substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule\nof general applicability.” §2000bb–1(a).2 If the Govern-\nment substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion,\nunder the Act that person is entitled to an exemption from\nthe rule unless the Government “demonstrates that appli-\ncation of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of\na compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\n——————\n  2 The Act defines “government” to include any “department” or\n\n“agency” of the United States. §2000bb–2(1).\n6            BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).3\n   As enacted in 1993, RFRA applied to both the Federal\nGovernment and the States, but the constitutional author-\nity invoked for regulating federal and state agencies dif-\nfered. As applied to a federal agency, RFRA is based on\nthe enumerated power that supports the particular agen-\ncy’s work,4 but in attempting to regulate the States and\ntheir subdivisions, Congress relied on its power under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the\nFirst Amendment. 521 U. S., at 516–517. In City of\nBoerne, however, we held that Congress had overstepped\nits Section 5 authority because “[t]he stringent test RFRA\ndemands” “far exceed[ed] any pattern or practice of uncon-\nstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as\ninterpreted in Smith.” Id., at 533–534. See also id., at\n532.\n   Following our decision in City of Boerne, Congress\npassed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000cc et seq. That statute, enacted under Congress’s\nCommerce and Spending Clause powers, imposes the\nsame general test as RFRA but on a more limited category\nof governmental actions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544\nU. S. 709, 715–716 (2005). And, what is most relevant for\npresent purposes, RLUIPA amended RFRA’s definition of\nthe “exercise of religion.” See §2000bb–2(4) (importing\nRLUIPA definition).

On this\nunderstanding of our pre-Smith cases, RFRA did more than merely\nrestore the balancing test used in the Sherbert line of cases; it provided\neven broader protection for religious liberty than was available under\nthose decisions.\n  4 See, e.g., Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F. 3d 96, 108 (CA2 2006); Guam v.\n\nGuerrero, 290 F. 3d 1210, 1220 (CA9 2002).\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

(defining “exercise of religion” as “the exer-\ncise of religion under the First Amendment”). In RLUIPA,\nin an obvious effort to effect a complete separation from\nFirst Amendment case law, Congress deleted the reference\nto the First Amendment and defined the “exercise of reli-\ngion” to include “any exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”\n§2000cc–5(7)(A). And Congress mandated that this con-\ncept “be construed in favor of a broad protection of reli-\ngious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the\nterms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc–\n3(g).5\n                             B\n   At issue in these cases are HHS regulations promul-\ngated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nof 2010 (ACA), 124 Stat. 119. ACA generally requires\nemployers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer\n“a group health plan or group health insurance coverage”\nthat provides “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U. S. C.\n§5000A(f)(2); §§4980H(a), (c)(2). Any covered employer\nthat does not provide such coverage must pay a substan-\ntial price. Specifically, if a covered employer provides\ngroup health insurance but its plan fails to comply with\nACA’s group-health-plan requirements, the employer may\nbe required to pay $100 per day for each affected “individ-\n——————\n   5 The principal dissent appears to contend that this rule of construc-\n\ntion should apply only when defining the “exercise of religion” in an\nRLUIPA case, but not in a RFRA case. See post, at 11, n. 10. That\nargument is plainly wrong. Under this rule of construction, the phrase\n“exercise of religion,” as it appears in RLUIPA, must be interpreted\nbroadly, and RFRA states that the same phrase, as used in RFRA,\nmeans “religious exercis[e] as defined in [RLUIPA].” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb–2(4). It necessarily follows that the “exercise of religion”\nunder RFRA must be given the same broad meaning that applies under\nRLUIPA.\n8         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nual.” §§4980D(a)–(b). And if the employer decides to stop\nproviding health insurance altogether and at least one\nfull-time employee enrolls in a health plan and qualifies\nfor a subsidy on one of the government-run ACA exchanges,\nthe employer must pay $2,000 per year for each of its full-\ntime employees. §§4980H(a), (c)(1).\n   Unless an exception applies, ACA requires an employ-\ner’s group health plan or group-health-insurance coverage\nto furnish “preventive care and screenings” for women\nwithout “any cost sharing requirements.” 42 U. S. C.\n§300gg–13(a)(4). Congress itself, however, did not specify\nwhat types of preventive care must be covered. Instead,\nCongress authorized the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), a component of HHS, to make\nthat important and sensitive decision. Ibid. The HRSA in\nturn consulted the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group\nof volunteer advisers, in determining which preventive\nservices to require. See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725–8726 (2012).\n   In August 2011, based on the Institute’s recommenda-\ntions, the HRSA promulgated the Women’s Preventive\nServices Guidelines. See id., at 8725–8726, and n. 1;\nonline at http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2014, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). The Guidelines provide that nonex-\nempt employers are generally required to provide “cover-\nage, without cost sharing” for “[a]ll Food and Drug Ad-\nministration [(FDA)] approved contraceptive methods,\nsterilization procedures, and patient education and coun-\nseling.” 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Although many of the required, FDA-approved\nmethods of contraception work by preventing the fertiliza-\ntion of an egg, four of those methods (those specifically at\nissue in these cases) may have the effect of preventing an\nalready fertilized egg from developing any further by\ninhibiting its attachment to the uterus.

That category encompasses “churches,\ntheir integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associ-\nations of churches,” as well as “the exclusively religious\nactivities of any religious order.” See ibid (citing 26\nU. S. C. §§6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)).     In its Guidelines,\nHRSA exempted these organizations from the requirement\nto cover contraceptive services.        See http://hrsa.gov/\nwomensguidelines.\n   In addition, HHS has effectively exempted certain\nreligious nonprofit organizations, described under HHS\nregulations as “eligible organizations,” from the contracep-\ntive mandate. See 45 CFR §147.131(b); 78 Fed. Reg.\n39874 (2013). An “eligible organization” means a nonprofit\norganization that “holds itself out as a religious organi-\nzation” and “opposes providing coverage for some or all of\nany contraceptive services required to be covered . . . on\naccount of religious objections.” 45 CFR §147.131(b). To\nqualify for this accommodation, an employer must certify\nthat it is such an organization. §147.131(b)(4). When a\ngroup-health-insurance issuer receives notice that one of\nits clients has invoked this provision, the issuer must then\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan\n——————\n  6 We   will use “Brief for HHS” to refer to the Brief for Petitioners in\nNo. 13–354 and the Brief for Respondents in No. 13–356.

Reg. 39877.9\n   In addition to these exemptions for religious organiza-\ntions, ACA exempts a great many employers from most of\nits coverage requirements. Employers providing “grandfa-\nthered health plans”—those that existed prior to March\n23, 2010, and that have not made specified changes after\nthat date—need not comply with many of the Act’s re-\nquirements, including the contraceptive mandate. 42\nU. S. C. §§18011(a), (e). And employers with fewer than\n50 employees are not required to provide health insurance\n——————\n  8 In  the case of self-insured religious organizations entitled to the\naccommodation, the third-party administrator of the organization must\n“provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services” for the organi-\nzation’s employees without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on\nthe eligible organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiar-\nies.    78 Fed. Reg. 39893 (to be codified in 26 CFR §54.9815–\n2713A(b)(2)). The regulations establish a mechanism for these third-\nparty administrators to be compensated for their expenses by obtaining\na reduction in the fee paid by insurers to participate in the federally\nfacilitated exchanges. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39893 (to be codified in 26 CFR\n§54.9815–2713A (b)(3)). HHS believes that these fee reductions will not\nmaterially affect funding of the exchanges because “payments for\ncontraceptive services will represent only a small portion of total\n[exchange] user fees.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39882.\n   9 In a separate challenge to this framework for religious nonprofit\n\norganizations, the Court recently ordered that, pending appeal, the\neligible organizations be permitted to opt out of the contraceptive\nmandate by providing written notification of their objections to the\nSecretary of HHS, rather than to their insurance issuers or third-party\nadministrators.

Supp. 2d 1278 (WD Okla. 2012), and the\nplaintiffs appealed, moving for initial en banc considera-\ntion. The Tenth Circuit granted that motion and reversed\nin a divided opinion. Contrary to the conclusion of the\nThird Circuit, the Tenth Circuit held that the Greens’ two\nfor-profit businesses are “persons” within the meaning of\nRFRA and therefore may bring suit under that law.\n   The court then held that the corporations had estab-\nlished a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim. 723\nF. 3d, at 1140–1147. The court concluded that the contra-\nceptive mandate substantially burdened the exercise of\nreligion by requiring the companies to choose between\n“compromis[ing] their religious beliefs” and paying a\nheavy fee—either “close to $475 million more in taxes\nevery year” if they simply refused to provide coverage for\nthe contraceptives at issue, or “roughly $26 million” annu-\nally if they “drop[ped] health-insurance benefits for all\nemployees.” Id., at 1141.\n   The court next held that HHS had failed to demonstrate\na compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against the\nGreens’ businesses and, in the alternative, that HHS had\nfailed to prove that enforcement of the mandate was the\n“least restrictive means” of furthering the Government’s\nasserted interests.

S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b) (emphasis added).\nThe first question that we must address is whether this\nprovision applies to regulations that govern the activities\nof for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga,\nand Mardel.\n  HHS contends that neither these companies nor their\nowners can even be heard under RFRA. According to\nHHS, the companies cannot sue because they seek to\nmake a profit for their owners, and the owners cannot\nbe heard because the regulations, at least as a formal mat-\nter, apply only to the companies and not to the owners\nas individuals. HHS’s argument would have dramatic\nconsequences.\n  Consider this Court’s decision in Braunfeld v. Brown,\n\n——————\n  17 Given its RFRA ruling, the court declined to address the plaintiffs’\nfree-exercise claim or the question whether the Greens could bring\nRFRA claims as individual owners of Hobby Lobby and Mardel. Four\njudges, however, concluded that the Greens could do so, see 723 F. 3d,\nat 1156 (Gorsuch, J., concurring); id., at 1184 (Matheson, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part), and three of those judges would have\ngranted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, see id., at 1156 (Gorsuch,\nJ., concurring).\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n366 U. S. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion). In that case, five\nOrthodox Jewish merchants who ran small retail busi-\nnesses in Philadelphia challenged a Pennsylvania Sunday\nclosing law as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.\nBecause of their faith, these merchants closed their shops\non Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to\nremain shut on Sunday threatened them with financial\nruin. The Court entertained their claim (although it ruled\nagainst them on the merits), and if a similar claim were\nraised today under RFRA against a jurisdiction still sub-\nject to the Act (for example, the District of Columbia, see\n42 U. S. C. §2000bb–2(2)), the merchants would be enti-\ntled to be heard. According to HHS, however, if these\nmerchants chose to incorporate their businesses—with-\nout in any way changing the size or nature of their busi-\nnesses—they would forfeit all RFRA (and free-exercise)\nrights. HHS would put these merchants to a difficult\nchoice: either give up the right to seek judicial protection\nof their religious liberty or forgo the benefits, available to\ntheir competitors, of operating as corporations.\n   As we have seen, RFRA was designed to provide very\nbroad protection for religious liberty. By enacting RFRA,\nCongress went far beyond what this Court has held is\nconstitutionally required.18 Is there any reason to think\nthat the Congress that enacted such sweeping protection\nput small-business owners to the choice that HHS sug-\ngests? An examination of RFRA’s text, to which we turn\n——————\n   18 As discussed, n. 3, supra, in City of Boerne we stated that RFRA, by\n\nimposing a least-restrictive-means test, went beyond what was re-\nquired by our pre-Smith decisions. Although the author of the principal\ndissent joined the Court’s opinion in City of Boerne, she now claims that\nthe statement was incorrect. Post, at 12. For present purposes, it is\nunnecessary to adjudicate this dispute. Even if RFRA simply restored\nthe status quo ante, there is no reason to believe, as HHS and the\ndissent seem to suggest, that the law was meant to be limited to situa-\ntions that fall squarely within the holdings of pre-Smith cases. See\ninfra, at 25–28.\n18         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the next part of this opinion, reveals that Congress did\nno such thing.\n   As we will show, Congress provided protection for people\nlike the Hahns and Greens by employing a familiar legal\nfiction: It included corporations within RFRA’s definition\nof “persons.” But it is important to keep in mind that the\npurpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human\nbeings. A corporation is simply a form of organization\nused by human beings to achieve desired ends. An estab-\nlished body of law specifies the rights and obligations of\nthe people (including shareholders, officers, and employ-\nees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or\nanother. When rights, whether constitutional or statu-\ntory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect\nthe rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth\nAmendment protection to corporations protects the privacy\ninterests of employees and others associated with the\ncompany. Protecting corporations from government sei-\nzure of their property without just compensation protects\nall those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial\nwell-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of\ncorporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel\nprotects the religious liberty of the humans who own and\ncontrol those companies.\n   In holding that Conestoga, as a “secular, for-profit cor-\nporation,” lacks RFRA protection, the Third Circuit wrote\nas follows:\n     “General business corporations do not, separate and\n     apart from the actions or belief systems of their indi­\n     vidual owners or employees, exercise religion. They do\n     not pray, worship, observe sacraments or take other\n     religiously-motivated actions separate and apart from\n     the intention and direction of their individual actors.”\n     724 F. 3d, at 385 (emphasis added).\nAll of this is true—but quite beside the point.

S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b), and RFRA\nitself does not define the term “person.” We therefore look\nto the Dictionary Act, which we must consult “[i]n deter-\nmining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the\ncontext indicates otherwise.” 1 U. S. C. §1.\n   Under the Dictionary Act, “the wor[d] ‘person’ . . . in-\nclude[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms,\npartnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well\nas individuals.” Ibid.; see FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (“We have no doubt that\n‘person,’ in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities.\nThe Dictionary Act makes that clear”). Thus, unless there\nis something about the RFRA context that “indicates\notherwise,” the Dictionary Act provides a quick, clear, and\naffirmative answer to the question whether the companies\ninvolved in these cases may be heard.\n   We see nothing in RFRA that suggests a congressional\nintent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition, and\nHHS makes little effort to argue otherwise. We have\nentertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by\nnonprofit corporations, see Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita\nBeneficiente União do Vegetal, 546 U.

No\nknown understanding of the term “person” includes some\nbut not all corporations. The term “person” sometimes\nencompasses artificial persons (as the Dictionary Act\ninstructs), and it sometimes is limited to natural persons.\nBut no conceivable definition of the term includes natural\npersons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit\ncorporations.20 Cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.

Neither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides any\npersuasive explanation for this conclusion.\n  Is it because of the corporate form? The corporate form\nalone cannot provide the explanation because, as we have\npointed out, HHS concedes that nonprofit corporations can\n——————\n  19 Cf. Brief for Federal Petitioners in O Centro, O.

The dissent suggests that nonprofit\ncorporations are special because furthering their reli-\ngious “autonomy . . . often furthers individual religious\nfreedom as well.” Post, at 15 (quoting Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 342 (1987) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment)). But this principle applies\nequally to for-profit corporations: Furthering their re-\nligious freedom also “furthers individual religious freedom.”\nIn these cases, for example, allowing Hobby Lobby, Con-\nestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the\nreligious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns.21\n   If the corporate form is not enough, what about the\nprofit-making objective? In Braunfeld, 366 U. S. 599, we\nentertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who\nwere attempting to make a profit as retail merchants, and\nthe Court never even hinted that this objective precluded\ntheir claims. As the Court explained in a later case, the\n“exercise of religion” involves “not only belief and profes-\nsion but the performance of (or abstention from) physical\nacts” that are “engaged in for religious reasons.” Smith,\n494 U. S., at 877. Business practices that are compelled or\nlimited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comforta-\nbly within that definition. Thus, a law that “operates so\nas to make the practice of . . . religious beliefs more expen-\nsive” in the context of business activities imposes a burden\non the exercise of religion. Braunfeld, supra, at 605; see\nUnited States v. Lee, 455 U.

See post, at 19 (dismissing the relevance of Braunfeld in part\nbecause “[t]he free exercise claim asserted there was promptly rejected\non the merits”).\n   23 See, e.g., 724 F. 3d, at 385 (“We do not see how a for-profit, ‘artifi-\n\ncial being,’ . . . that was created to make money” could exercise reli-\ngion); Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F. 3d 850, 857 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J.\ndissenting) (“So far as it appears, the mission of Grote Industries, like\nthat of any other for-profit, secular business, is to make money in the\ncommercial sphere”); Autocam Corp. v.

J., dissenting)\n(“[T]he specific purpose for which [a corporation] is created matters\ngreatly to how it will be categorized and treated under the law” and “it\nis undisputed that Hobby Lobby and Mardel are for-profit corporations\nfocused on selling merchandise to consumers”).\n   The principal dissent makes a similar point, stating that “[f]or-profit\ncorporations are different from religious nonprofits in that they use\nlabor to make a profit, rather than to perpetuate the religious values\nshared by a community of believers.” Post, at 18–19 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The first half of this statement is a tautology; for-\nprofit corporations do indeed differ from nonprofits insofar as they seek\nto make a profit for their owners, but the second part is factually\nuntrue. As the activities of the for-profit corporations involved in these\ncases show, some for-profit corporations do seek “to perpetuate the\nreligious values shared,” in these cases, by their owners. Conestoga’s\nVision and Values Statement declares that the company is dedicated to\noperating “in [a] manner that reflects our Christian heritage and the\nhighest ethical and moral principles of business.” App. in No. 13–356,\np. 94.

Hazen, Treatise of the Law of Corporations §4:1,\np. 224 (3d ed. 2010) (emphasis added); see 1A W. Fletcher,\nCyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §102 (rev. ed. 2010).\nWhile it is certainly true that a central objective of for-\nprofit corporations is to make money, modern corporate\nlaw does not require for-profit corporations to pursue\nprofit at the expense of everything else, and many do not\ndo so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval,\nsupport a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at\nall uncommon for such corporations to further humanitar-\nian and other altruistic objectives. Many examples come\nreadily to mind. So long as its owners agree, a for-profit\ncorporation may take costly pollution-control and energy-\nconservation measures that go beyond what the law re-\nquires. A for-profit corporation that operates facilities in\nother countries may exceed the requirements of local law\nregarding working conditions and benefits. If for-profit\ncorporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is\nno apparent reason why they may not further religious\nobjectives as well.\n   HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corpo-\n——————\noperating . . . in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.” App. in\nNo. 13–354, p. 135. The dissent also believes that history is not on our\nside because even Blackstone recognized the distinction between\n“ecclesiastical and lay” corporations. Post, at 18. What Blackstone\nillustrates, however, is that dating back to 1765, there was no sharp\ndivide among corporations in their capacity to exercise religion; Black-\nstone recognized that even what he termed “lay” corporations might\nserve “the promotion of piety.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaw of England 458–459 (1765). And whatever may have been the case\nat the time of Blackstone, modern corporate law (and the law of the\nStates in which these three companies are incorporated) allows for-\nprofit corporations to “perpetuat[e] religious values.”\n24           BURWELL v.

Not all\ncorporations that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in\norder to maximize profit. For example, organizations with\nreligious and charitable aims might organize as for-profit\ncorporations because of the potential advantages of that\ncorporate form, such as the freedom to participate in\nlobbying for legislation or campaigning for political candi-\ndates who promote their religious or charitable goals.24 In\nfact, recognizing the inherent compatibility between estab-\nlishing a for-profit corporation and pursuing nonprofit\ngoals, States have increasingly adopted laws formally\nrecognizing hybrid corporate forms.

This argument has many\nflaws.\n   First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted\nsuggested that the statutory phrase “exercise of religion\nunder the First Amendment” was meant to be tied to this\nCourt’s pre-Smith interpretation of that Amendment.\nWhen first enacted, RFRA defined the “exercise of reli-\ngion” to mean “the exercise of religion under the First\nAmendment”—not the exercise of religion as recognized\nonly by then-existing Supreme Court precedents. 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). When Congress wants to\nlink the meaning of a statutory provision to a body of this\nCourt’s case law, it knows how to do so. See, e.g., Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28\n26           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1) (authorizing habeas relief from a\nstate-court decision that “was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates”).\n   Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear\nenough on this point—and we think it was—the amend-\nment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt.\nThat amendment deleted the prior reference to the First\nAmendment, see 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (2000 ed.) (in-\ncorporating §2000cc–5), and neither HHS nor the principal\ndissent can explain why Congress did this if it wanted to\ntie RFRA coverage tightly to the specific holdings of our\npre-Smith free-exercise cases. Moreover, as discussed, the\namendment went further, providing that the exercise of\nreligion “shall be construed in favor of a broad protection\nof religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by\nthe terms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc–\n3(g). It is simply not possible to read these provisions as\nrestricting the concept of the “exercise of religion” to those\npractices specifically addressed in our pre-Smith decisions.\n   Third, the one pre-Smith case involving the free-exercise\nrights of a for-profit corporation suggests, if anything, that\nfor-profit corporations possess such rights. In Gallagher v.\nCrown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc., 366 U. S. 617\n(1961), the Massachusetts Sunday closing law was chal-\nlenged by a kosher market that was organized as a for-\nprofit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a\nrabbi. The Commonwealth argued that the corporation\nlacked “standing” to assert a free-exercise claim,26 but not\none member of the Court expressed agreement with that\n\n——————\n  26 See  Brief for Appellants in Gallagher, O. T. 1960 No. 11, pp. 16, 28–\n31 (arguing that corporation “has no ‘religious belief’ or ‘religious\nliberty,’ and had no standing in court to assert that its free exercise of\nreligion was impaired”).\n                 Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargument. The plurality opinion for four Justices rejected\nthe First Amendment claim on the merits based on the\nreasoning in Braunfeld, and reserved decision on the\nquestion whether the corporation had “standing” to raise\nthe claim. See 366 U. S., at 631. The three dissenters,\nJustices Douglas, Brennan, and Stewart, found the law\nunconstitutional as applied to the corporation and the\nother challengers and thus implicitly recognized their\nright to assert a free-exercise claim. See id., at 642 (Bren-\nnan, J., joined by Stewart, J., dissenting); McGowan v.\nMaryland, 366 U. S. 420, 578–579 (1961) (Douglas, J.,\ndissenting as to related cases including Gallagher). Fi-\nnally, Justice Frankfurter’s opinion, which was joined by\nJustice Harlan, upheld the Massachusetts law on the\nmerits but did not question or reserve decision on the\nissue of the right of the corporation or any of the other\nchallengers to be heard. See McGowan, 366 U. S., at 521–\n522. It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted\nto provide very broad protection for religious liberty,\nleft for-profit corporations unprotected simply because in\nGallagher—the only pre-Smith case in which the issue\nwas raised—a majority of the Justices did not find it nec-\nessary to decide whether the kosher market’s corporate\nstatus barred it from raising a free-exercise claim.\n    Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely\nrestored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form\nand did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA claim unless\nthat plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of\nwhom had brought a free-exercise claim that this Court\nentertained in the years before Smith. For example, we\nare not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court\nentertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident\nnoncitizen. Are such persons also beyond RFRA’s protec-\ntive reach simply because the Court never addressed their\nrights before Smith?\n   Presumably in recognition of the weakness of this ar-\n28           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngument, both HHS and the principal dissent fall back on\nthe broader contention that the Nation lacks a tradition of\nexempting for-profit corporations from generally applica-\nble laws. By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like Title\nVII, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–19(A), expressly exempt churches\nand other nonprofit religious institutions but not for-profit\ncorporations. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–356, p. 26. In\nmaking this argument, however, HHS did not call to our\nattention the fact that some federal statutes do exempt\ncategories of entities that include for-profit corporations\nfrom laws that would otherwise require these entities to\nengage in activities to which they object on grounds of\nconscience. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §300a–7(b)(2); §238n(a).27\nIf Title VII and similar laws show anything, it is\nthat Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a\nreligious accommodation not to extend to for-profit\ncorporations.\n\n\n——————\n   27 The principal dissent points out that “the exemption codified in\n\n§238n(a) was not enacted until three years after RFRA’s passage.”\nPost, at 16, n. 15. The dissent takes this to mean that RFRA did not, in\nfact, “ope[n] all statutory schemes to religion-based challenges by for-\nprofit corporations” because if it had “there would be no need for a\nstatute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.” Ibid.\n   This argument fails to recognize that the protection provided by\n§238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by RFRA.\nSection 238n(a) flatly prohibits discrimination against a covered\nhealthcare facility for refusing to engage in certain activities related to\nabortion. If a covered healthcare facility challenged such discrimina-\ntion under RFRA, by contrast, the discrimination would be unlawful\nonly if a court concluded, among other things, that there was a less\nrestrictive means of achieving any compelling government interest.\n   In addition, the dissent’s argument proves too much. Section\n238n(a) applies evenly to “any health care entity”—whether it is a\nreligious nonprofit entity or a for-profit entity. There is no dispute that\nRFRA protects religious nonprofit corporations, so if §238n(a) were\nredundant as applied to for-profit corporations, it would be equally\nredundant as applied to nonprofits.\n                     Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)                    29\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               4\n   Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have\nwanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because it\nis difficult as a practical matter to ascertain the sincere\n“beliefs” of a corporation. HHS goes so far as to raise the\nspecter of “divisive, polarizing proxy battles over the reli-\ngious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such\nas IBM or General Electric.” Brief for HHS in No. 13–356,\nat 30.\n   These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded\ncorporations, and it seems unlikely that the sort of corpo-\nrate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA\nclaims. HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly\ntraded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous\npractical restraints would likely prevent that from occur-\nring. For example, the idea that unrelated shareholders—\nincluding institutional investors with their own set of\nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the\nsame religious beliefs seems improbable. In any event, we\nhave no occasion in these cases to consider RFRA’s ap-\nplicability to such companies. The companies in the cases\nbefore us are closely held corporations, each owned and\ncontrolled by members of a single family, and no one has\ndisputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs.28\n   HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported\nproblem of determining the sincerity of an asserted reli-\ngious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corpora-\ntions from RFRA’s protection. On the contrary, the scope\nof RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the\nability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims.\nRLUIPA applies to “institutionalized persons,” a category\n——————\n  28 To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be “sin-\ncere”; a corporation’s pretextual assertion of a religious belief in order\nto obtain an exemption for financial reasons would fail. Cf., e.g., United\nStates v. Quaintance, 608 F. 3d 717, 718–719 (CA10 2010).\n30          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat consists primarily of prisoners, and by the time of\nRLUIPA’s enactment, the propensity of some prisoners to\nassert claims of dubious sincerity was well documented.29\nNevertheless, after our decision in City of Boerne, Con-\ngress enacted RLUIPA to preserve the right of prisoners to\nraise religious liberty claims. If Congress thought that the\nfederal courts were up to the job of dealing with insincere\nprisoner claims, there is no reason to believe that Con-\ngress limited RFRA’s reach out of concern for the seem-\ningly less difficult task of doing the same in corporate\ncases. And if, as HHS seems to concede, Congress wanted\nRFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply Brief\nin No. 13–354, at 7–8, what reason is there to think that\nCongress believed that spotting insincere claims would\nbe tougher in cases involving for-profits?\n   HHS and the principal dissent express concern about\nthe possibility of disputes among the owners of corpora-\ntions, but that is not a problem that arises because of\nRFRA or that is unique to this context. The owners of\nclosely held corporations may—and sometimes do—\ndisagree about the conduct of business. 1 Treatise of the\nLaw of Corporations §14:11. And even if RFRA did not\nexist, the owners of a company might well have a dispute\nrelating to religion. For example, some might want a\ncompany’s stores to remain open on the Sabbath in order\nto make more money, and others might want the stores to\nclose for religious reasons. State corporate law provides a\nready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example,\ndictating how a corporation can establish its governing\nstructure. See, e.g., ibid; id., §3:2; Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8,\n§351 (2011) (providing that certificate of incorporation\n\n——————\n  29 See,\n        e.g., Ochs v. Thalacker, 90 F. 3d 293, 296 (CA8 1996); Green v.\nWhite, 525 F.

Courts will turn to that structure and the\nunderlying state law in resolving disputes.\n  For all these reasons, we hold that a federal regulation’s\nrestriction on the activities of a for-profit closely held\ncorporation must comply with RFRA.30\n                             IV\n  Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask\nwhether the HHS contraceptive mandate “substantially\nburden[s]” the exercise of religion. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–\n1(a). We have little trouble concluding that it does.\n——————\n  30 The   principal dissent attaches significance to the fact that the\n“Senate voted down [a] so-called ‘conscience amendment,’ which would\nhave enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage\nbased on its asserted religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Post, at 6.\nThe dissent would evidently glean from that vote an intent by the\nSenate to prohibit for-profit corporate employers from refusing to offer\ncontraceptive coverage for religious reasons, regardless of whether the\ncontraceptive mandate could pass muster under RFRA’s standards.\nBut that is not the only plausible inference from the failed amend-\nment—or even the most likely. For one thing, the text of the amend-\nment was “written so broadly that it would allow any employer to deny\nany health service to any American for virtually any reason—not just\nfor religious objections.” 158 Cong. Rec. S1165 (Mar. 1, 2012) (emphasis\nadded). Moreover, the amendment would have authorized a blanket\nexemption for religious or moral objectors; it would not have subjected\nreligious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny called for by RFRA, in\nwhich a court must consider not only the burden of a requirement on\nreligious adherents, but also the government’s interest and how nar-\nrowly tailored the requirement is. It is thus perfectly reasonable to\nbelieve that the amendment was voted down because it extended more\nbroadly than the pre-existing protections of RFRA. And in any event,\neven if a rejected amendment to a bill could be relevant in other con-\ntexts, it surely cannot be relevant here, because any “Federal statutory\nlaw adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to [RFRA] unless such\nlaw explicitly excludes such application by reference to [RFRA].” 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb–3(b) (emphasis added). It is not plausible to find such\nan explicit reference in the meager legislative history on which the\ndissent relies.\n32          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n  As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere\nreligious belief that life begins at conception. They there-\nfore object on religious grounds to providing health insur-\nance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS\nacknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 9, n. 4,\nmay result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring\nthe Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for\nsuch coverage, the HHS mandate demands that they\nengage in conduct that seriously violates their religious\nbeliefs.\n  If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not\nyield to this demand, the economic consequences will be\nsevere. If the companies continue to offer group health\nplans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they\nwill be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual. 26\nU. S. C. §4980D. For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount\nto $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for\nConestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or\n$33 million per year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000\nper day or about $15 million per year. These sums are\nsurely substantial.\n  It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assess-\nments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus\nforcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one\nof the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least\none of their full-time employees were to qualify for a sub-\nsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course\nwould also entail substantial economic consequences. The\ncompanies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee\neach year. §4980H. These penalties would amount to\nroughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for\nConestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.\n                              B\n     Although these totals are high, amici supporting HHS\n                     Cite as: 573 U.

We do not\ngenerally entertain arguments that were not raised below\nand are not advanced in this Court by any party, see\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60,\nn. 2 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 532, n. 13\n(1979); Knetsch v. United States, 364 U. S. 361, 370 (1960),\nand there are strong reasons to adhere to that practice in\nthese cases. HHS, which presumably could have compiled\nthe relevant statistics, has never made this argument—\nnot in its voluminous briefing or at oral argument in this\nCourt nor, to our knowledge, in any of the numerous cases\nin which the issue now before us has been litigated around\nthe country. As things now stand, we do not even know\nwhat the Government’s position might be with respect to\nthese amici’s intensely empirical argument.31 For this\nsame reason, the plaintiffs have never had an opportunity\nto respond to this novel claim that—contrary to their\nlongstanding practice and that of most large employers—\nthey would be better off discarding their employer insur-\nance plans altogether.\n  Even if we were to reach this argument, we would find it\nunpersuasive. As an initial matter, it entirely ignores the\nfact that the Hahns and Greens and their companies have\nreligious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage\nfor their employees. Before the advent of ACA, they were\nnot legally compelled to provide insurance, but they never-\ntheless did so—in part, no doubt, for conventional business\n——————\n   31 Indeed, one of HHS’s stated reasons for establishing the religious\n\naccommodation was to “encourag[e] eligible organizations to continue to\noffer health coverage.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39882 (2013) (emphasis added).\n34          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs\ngovern their relations with their employees. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 13–356, p. 11g; App. in No. 13–354,\nat 139.\n  Putting aside the religious dimension of the decision to\nprovide insurance, moreover, it is far from clear that the\nnet cost to the companies of providing insurance is more\nthan the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying\nthe ACA penalty. Health insurance is a benefit that em-\nployees value. If the companies simply eliminated that\nbenefit and forced employees to purchase their own insur-\nance on the exchanges, without offering additional com-\npensation, it is predictable that the companies would face\na competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting\nskilled workers. See App. in No. 13–354, at 153.\n  The companies could attempt to make up for the elimi-\nnation of a group health plan by increasing wages, but this\nwould be costly. Group health insurance is generally less\nexpensive than comparable individual coverage, so the\namount of the salary increase needed to fully compensate\nfor the termination of insurance coverage may well exceed\nthe cost to the companies of providing the insurance. In\naddition, any salary increase would have to take into\naccount the fact that employees must pay income taxes on\nwages but not on the value of employer-provided health\ninsurance. 26 U. S. C. §106(a). Likewise, employers can\ndeduct the cost of providing health insurance, see\n§162(a)(1), but apparently cannot deduct the amount of\nthe penalty that they must pay if insurance is not pro-\nvided; that difference also must be taken into account.\nGiven these economic incentives, it is far from clear that it\nwould be financially advantageous for an employer to drop\ncoverage and pay the penalty.32\n——————\n 32 Attempting to compensate for dropped insurance by raising wages\n\nwould also present administrative difficulties.

We doubt\nthat the Congress that enacted RFRA—or, for that matter,\nACA—would have believed it a tolerable result to put\nfamily-run businesses to the choice of violating their sin-\ncerely held religious beliefs or making all of their employ-\nees lose their existing healthcare plans.\n                             C\n  In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not\nimpose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion,\nHHS’s main argument (echoed by the principal dissent) is\nbasically that the connection between what the objecting\nparties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for\nfour methods of contraception that may operate after the\nfertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be\nmorally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too\nattenuated. Brief for HHS in 13–354, pp. 31–34; post, at\n22–23. HHS and the dissent note that providing the\ncoverage would not itself result in the destruction of an\nembryo; that would occur only if an employee chose to take\nadvantage of the coverage and to use one of the four meth-\nods at issue.33 Ibid.\n——————\ncompensation for employees, the companies would have to calculate the\nvalue to employees of the convenience of retaining their employer-\nprovided coverage and thus being spared the task of attempting to find\nand sign up for a comparable plan on an exchange. And because some\nbut not all of the companies’ employees may qualify for subsidies on an\nexchange, it would be nearly impossible to calculate a salary increase\nthat would accurately restore the status quo ante for all employees.\n  33 This argument is not easy to square with the position taken by\n\nHHS in providing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for\nreligious employers, such as churches, that have the very same reli-\ngious objections as the Hahns and Greens and their companies. The\nconnection between what these religious employers would be required\n36          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   This argument dodges the question that RFRA presents\n(whether the HHS mandate imposes a substantial burden\non the ability of the objecting parties to conduct business\nin accordance with their religious beliefs) and instead\naddresses a very different question that the federal courts\nhave no business addressing (whether the religious belief\nasserted in a RFRA case is reasonable). The Hahns and\nGreens believe that providing the coverage demanded by\nthe HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an\nembryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for\nthem to provide the coverage. This belief implicates a\ndifficult and important question of religion and moral\nphilosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is\nwrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in\nitself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the\ncommission of an immoral act by another.34 Arrogating\nthe authority to provide a binding national answer to this\nreligious and philosophical question, HHS and the princi-\n——————\nto do if not exempted (provide insurance coverage for particular contra-\nceptives) and the ultimate event that they find morally wrong (destruc-\ntion of an embryo) is exactly the same. Nevertheless, as discussed,\nHHS and the Labor and Treasury Departments authorized the exemp-\ntion from the contraceptive mandate of group health plans of certain\nreligious employers, and later expanded the exemption to include\ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contracep-\ntive coverage. 78 Fed. Reg. 39871. When this was done, the Govern-\nment made clear that its objective was to “protec[t]” these religious\nobjectors “from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for such\ncoverage.” Ibid. Those exemptions would be hard to understand if the\nplaintiffs’ objections here were not substantial.\n   34 See, e.g., Oderberg, The Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing, in\n\nModern Moral Philosophy 203–228 (A. O’Hear ed. 2004); T. Higgins,\nMan as Man: The Science and Art of Ethics 353, 355 (1949) (“The\ngeneral principles governing cooperation” in wrongdoing—i.e., “physical\nactivity (or its omission) by which a person assists in the evil act of\nanother who is the principal agent”—“present troublesome difficulties\nin application”); 1 H.

For good reason, we have repeatedly refused to\ntake such a step. See, e.g., Smith, 494 U. S., at 887 (“Re-\npeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned\nthat courts must not presume to determine . . . the plausi-\nbility of a religious claim”); Hernandez v. Commissioner,\n490 U. S. 680, 699 (1989); Presbyterian Church in U. S. v.\nMary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church,\n393 U. S. 440, 450 (1969).\n   Moreover, in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employ­\nment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707 (1981), we considered\nand rejected an argument that is nearly identical to the\none now urged by HHS and the dissent. In Thomas, a\nJehovah’s Witness was initially employed making sheet\nsteel for a variety of industrial uses, but he was later\ntransferred to a job making turrets for tanks. Id., at 710.\nBecause he objected on religious grounds to participating\nin the manufacture of weapons, he lost his job and sought\nunemployment compensation. Ruling against the em-\nployee, the state court had difficulty with the line that\nthe employee drew between work that he found to be con-\nsistent with his religious beliefs (helping to manufacture\nsteel that was used in making weapons) and work that he\nfound morally objectionable (helping to make the weapons\nthemselves). This Court, however, held that “it is not for\nus to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”\nId., at 715.35\n   Similarly, in these cases, the Hahns and Greens and\ntheir companies sincerely believe that providing the in-\nsurance coverage demanded by the HHS regulations lies\non the forbidden side of the line, and it is not for us to say\nthat their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\nInstead, our “narrow function . . . in this context is to\n——————\n  35 The principal dissent makes no effort to reconcile its view about the\n\nsubstantial-burden requirement with our decision in Thomas.\n38        BURWELL v.

See Tilton\nv. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 689 (1971) (plurality); Board\nof Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236,\n248–249 (1968). But in those cases, while the subsidies\nwere clearly contrary to the challengers’ views on a secu-\nlar issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the chal-\nlengers never articulated a religious objection to the sub-\nsidies. As we put it in Tilton, they were “unable to\nidentify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of\ntheir religious beliefs.” 403 U. S., at 689 (plurality opin-\nion); see Allen, supra, at 249 (“[A]ppellants have not con-\ntended that the New York law in any way coerces them as\nindividuals in the practice of their religion”). Here, in\ncontrast, the plaintiffs do assert that funding the specific\ncontraceptive methods at issue violates their religious\nbeliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity. Be-\ncause the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an\nenormous sum of money—as much as $475 million per\nyear in the case of Hobby Lobby—if they insist on provid-\ning insurance coverage in accordance with their religious\nbeliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden\non those beliefs.\n                              V\n  Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a sub-\nstantial burden on the exercise of religion, we must move\non and decide whether HHS has shown that the mandate\nboth “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further-\ning that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.

RFRA, however, contemplates a “more\nfocused” inquiry: It “requires the Government to demon-\nstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through\napplication of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the\nparticular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is\nbeing substantially burdened.” O’Centro, 546 U. S., at\n430–431 (quoting §2000bb–1(b)). This requires us to\n“loo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests” and to “scru-\ntiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions\nto particular religious claimants”—in other words, to look\nto the marginal interest in enforcing the contraceptive\nmandate in these cases. O Centro, supra, at 431.\n   In addition to asserting these very broadly framed\ninterests, HHS maintains that the mandate serves a\ncompelling interest in ensuring that all women have ac-\ncess to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost\nsharing. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 14–15, 49;\nsee Brief for HHS in No. 13–356, at 10, 48. Under our\ncases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to\nobtain contraceptives, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\nU. S. 479, 485–486 (1965), and HHS tells us that “[s]tudies\nhave demonstrated that even moderate copayments for\npreventive services can deter patients from receiving those\nservices.” Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, at 50 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The objecting parties contend that HHS has not shown\nthat the mandate serves a compelling government inter-\nest, and it is arguable that there are features of ACA that\nsupport that view. As we have noted, many employees—\n40         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthose covered by grandfathered plans and those who work\nfor employers with fewer than 50 employees—may have no\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all.\n   HHS responds that many legal requirements have\nexceptions and the existence of exceptions does not in\nitself indicate that the principal interest served by a law is\nnot compelling. Even a compelling interest may be out-\nweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier\nconsideration. In these cases, however, the interest served\nby one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for grandfa-\nthered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoid-\ning the inconvenience of amending an existing plan.\nGrandfathered plans are required “to comply with a subset\nof the Affordable Care Act’s health reform provisions” that\nprovide what HHS has described as “particularly signifi-\ncant protections.” 75 Fed. Reg. 34540 (2010). But the\ncontraceptive mandate is expressly excluded from this\nsubset. Ibid.\n   We find it unnecessary to adjudicate this issue. We will\nassume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access\nto the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling\nwithin the meaning of RFRA, and we will proceed to con-\nsider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether HHS\nhas shown that the contraceptive mandate is “the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b)(2).\n                             B\n   The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally\ndemanding, see City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532, and it is\nnot satisfied here. HHS has not shown that it lacks other\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a\nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion by the ob-\njecting parties in these cases. See §§2000bb–1(a), (b)\n(requiring the Government to “demonstrat[e] that applica-\ntion of [a substantial] burden to the person . . . is the least\n                       Cite as: 573 U.

This would certainly\nbe less restrictive of the plaintiffs’ religious liberty, and\nHHS has not shown, see §2000bb–1(b)(2), that this is not a\nviable alternative. HHS has not provided any estimate of\nthe average cost per employee of providing access to\nthese contraceptives, two of which, according to the FDA,\nare designed primarily for emergency use. See Birth\nControl: Medicines to Help You, online at http://\nwww.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepubli\ncations/ucm313215.htm.       Nor has HHS provided any\nstatistics regarding the number of employees who might\nbe affected because they work for corporations like Hobby\nLobby, Conestoga, and Mardel. Nor has HHS told us that\nit is unable to provide such statistics. It seems likely,\nhowever, that the cost of providing the forms of contracep-\ntives at issue in these cases (if not all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives) would be minor when compared with the\noverall cost of ACA. According to one of the Congressional\nBudget Office’s most recent forecasts, ACA’s insurance-\ncoverage provisions will cost the Federal Government\nmore than $1.3 trillion through the next decade. See CBO,\nUpdated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Cover-\nage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, April 2014, p.\n2.36 If, as HHS tells us, providing all women with cost-free\naccess to all FDA-approved methods of contraception is a\nGovernment interest of the highest order, it is hard to\nunderstand HHS’s argument that it cannot be required\nunder RFRA to pay anything in order to achieve this\n——————\n 36 Online   at http://cbo.gov/publication/45231.\n42           BURWELL v.

Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 720 (2005)\n(applying RLUIPA). That consideration will often inform the analysis\nof the Government’s compelling interest and the availability of a less\nrestrictive means of advancing that interest. But it could not reasona-\nbly be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no matter how\nonerous and no matter how readily the government interest could be\nachieved through alternative means, is permissible under RFRA so long\nas the relevant legal obligation requires the religious adherent to confer\na benefit on third parties. Otherwise, for example, the Government\ncould decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience\nof customers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections\nfrom owning supermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must\nremain open on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn\ntips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning\nrestaurants). By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a\nthird party, the Government could turn all regulations into entitle-\nments to which nobody could object on religious grounds, rendering\nRFRA meaningless. In any event, our decision in these cases need not\nresult in any detrimental effect on any third party.

Cf. §2000cc–3(c) (RLUIPA: “[T]his chapter may\nrequire a government to incur expenses in its own opera-\ntions to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious\nexercise.”). HHS’s view that RFRA can never require the\nGovernment to spend even a small amount reflects a\njudgment about the importance of religious liberty that\nwas not shared by the Congress that enacted that law.\n   In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a\nnew, government-funded program in order to conclude\nthat the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means\ntest. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its dis-\nposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring\nemployers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their\nreligious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already\nestablished an accommodation for nonprofit organizations\nwith religious objections. See supra, at 9–10, and nn. 8–9.\nUnder that accommodation, the organization can self-\ncertify that it opposes providing coverage for particular\ncontraceptive services. See 45 CFR §§147.131(b)(4), (c)(1);\n26 CFR §§54.9815–2713A(a)(4), (b). If the organization\nmakes such a certification, the organization’s insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator must “[e]xpressly\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health\ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group\nhealth plan” and “[p]rovide separate payments for any\ncontraceptive services required to be covered” without\nimposing “any cost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligi-\nble organization, the group health plan, or plan partici-\npants or beneficiaries.” 45 CFR §147.131(c)(2); 26 CFR\n§54.9815–2713A(c)(2).38\n——————\n 38 HHS   has concluded that insurers that insure eligible employers\n44           BURWELL v.

This is indeed “scarcely what Congress con-\ntemplated.” Ibid.\n                              C\n   HHS and the principal dissent argue that a ruling in\nfavor of the objecting parties in these cases will lead to a\nflood of religious objections regarding a wide variety of\nmedical procedures and drugs, such as vaccinations and\nblood transfusions, but HHS has made no effort to sub-\nstantiate this prediction.42 HHS points to no evidence that\ninsurance plans in existence prior to the enactment of\nACA excluded coverage for such items. Nor has HHS\nprovided evidence that any significant number of employ-\ners sought exemption, on religious grounds, from any of\nACA’s coverage requirements other than the contraceptive\nmandate.\n   It is HHS’s apparent belief that no insurance-coverage\nmandate would violate RFRA—no matter how significantly\nit impinges on the religious liberties of employers—that\nwould lead to intolerable consequences.

The\nowners of many closely held corporations could not in good\nconscience provide such coverage, and thus HHS would\neffectively exclude these people from full participation in\nthe economic life of the Nation. RFRA was enacted to\nprevent such an outcome.\n   In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned\nsolely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision\nshould not be understood to hold that an insurance-\ncoverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with\nan employer’s religious beliefs. Other coverage require-\nments, such as immunizations, may be supported by dif-\nferent interests (for example, the need to combat the\nspread of infectious diseases) and may involve different\narguments about the least restrictive means of providing\nthem.\n   The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrim-\nination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might\nbe cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction.\nSee post, at 32–33. Our decision today provides no such\nshield. The Government has a compelling interest in\nproviding an equal opportunity to participate in the work-\nforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial\ndiscrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that criti-\ncal goal.\n   HHS also raises for the first time in this Court the\nargument that applying the contraceptive mandate to for-\nprofit employers with sincere religious objections is essen-\ntial to the comprehensive health-insurance scheme that\nACA establishes. HHS analogizes the contraceptive man-\ndate to the requirement to pay Social Security taxes,\nwhich we upheld in Lee despite the religious objection of\nan employer, but these cases are quite different. Our\nholding in Lee turned primarily on the special problems\n                  Cite as: 573 U.

We noted\nthat “[t]he obligation to pay the social security tax initially\nis not fundamentally different from the obligation to pay\nincome taxes.” 455 U. S., at 260. Based on that premise,\nwe explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to\nseek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections\nto particular Government expenditures: “If, for example, a\nreligious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain\npercentage of the federal budget can be identified as de-\nvoted to war-related activities, such individuals would\nhave a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that\npercentage of the income tax.” Ibid. We observed that\n“[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were\nallowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments\nwere spent in a manner that violates their religious be-\nlief.” Ibid.; see O Centro, 546 U. S., at 435.\n   Lee was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the\nissue in Lee were analyzed under the RFRA framework,\nthe fundamental point would be that there simply is no\nless restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement\nto pay taxes. Because of the enormous variety of govern-\nment expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing tax-\npayers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on\nreligious grounds would lead to chaos.            Recognizing\nexemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very differ-\nent. ACA does not create a large national pool of tax\nrevenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage. Ra-\nther, individual employers like the plaintiffs purchase\ninsurance for their own employees. And contrary to the\nprincipal dissent’s characterization, the employers’ contri-\nbutions do not necessarily funnel into “undifferentiated\nfunds.” Post, at 23. The accommodation established by\nHHS requires issuers to have a mechanism by which to\n“segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible\norganization from the monies used to provide payments\nfor contraceptive services.” 45 CFR §147.131(c)(2)(ii).\n48          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nRecognizing a religious accommodation under RFRA for\nparticular coverage requirements, therefore, does not\nthreaten the viability of ACA’s comprehensive scheme in\nthe way that recognizing religious objections to particular\nexpenditures from general tax revenues would.43\n  In its final pages, the principal dissent reveals that its\nfundamental objection to the claims of the plaintiffs is an\nobjection to RFRA itself. The dissent worries about forc-\ning the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims\nmade by litigants seeking a religious exemption from\ngenerally applicable laws, and the dissent expresses a\ndesire to keep the courts out of this business. See post, at\n32–35. In making this plea, the dissent reiterates a point\nmade forcefully by the Court in Smith. 494 U. S., at 888–\n889 (applying the Sherbert test to all free-exercise claims\n“would open the prospect of constitutionally required\nreligious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every\nconceivable kind”). But Congress, in enacting RFRA, took\nthe position that “the compelling interest test as set forth\nin prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for\nstriking sensible balances between religious liberty and\ncompeting prior governmental interests.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb(a)(5). The wisdom of Congress’s judgment on this\n——————\n  43 HHS   highlights certain statements in the opinion in Lee that it\nregards as supporting its position in these cases. In particular, HHS\nnotes the statement that “[w]hen followers of a particular sect enter\ninto commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on\ntheir own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\nsuperimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in\nthat activity.” 455 U. S., at 261. Lee was a free exercise, not a RFRA,\ncase, and the statement to which HHS points, if taken at face value, is\nsquarely inconsistent with the plain meaning of RFRA. Under RFRA,\nwhen followers of a particular religion choose to enter into commercial\nactivity, the Government does not have a free hand in imposing obliga-\ntions that substantially burden their exercise of religion. Rather, the\nGovernment can impose such a burden only if the strict RFRA test is\nmet.\n                 Cite as: 573 U.

At the outset it should be\nsaid that the Court’s opinion does not have the breadth\nand sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful\ndissent. The Court and the dissent disagree on the proper\ninterpretation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration\nAct of 1993 (RFRA), but do agree on the purpose of that\nstatute. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq. It is to ensure that\ninterests in religious freedom are protected. Ante, at 5–6;\npost, at 8–9 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n  In our constitutional tradition, freedom means that all\npersons have the right to believe or strive to believe in a\ndivine creator and a divine law. For those who choose this\n2         BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ncourse, free exercise is essential in preserving their own\ndignity and in striving for a self-definition shaped by their\nreligious precepts. Free exercise in this sense implicates\nmore than just freedom of belief. See Cantwell v. Connect-\nicut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940). It means, too, the right\nto express those beliefs and to establish one’s religious\n(or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and\neconomic life of our larger community. But in a complex\nsociety and an era of pervasive governmental regulation,\ndefining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult.\nIn these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise\ntheir religious beliefs within the context of their own\nclosely held, for-profit corporations. They claim protection\nunder RFRA, the federal statute discussed with care and\nin detail in the Court’s opinion.\n  As the Court notes, under our precedents, RFRA imposes\na “ ‘stringent test.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U. S. 507, 533 (1997)). The Government must\ndemonstrate that the application of a substantial burden\nto a person’s exercise of religion “(1) is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-\nmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).\n  As to RFRA’s first requirement, the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) makes the case that\nthe mandate serves the Government’s compelling interest\nin providing insurance coverage that is necessary to pro-\ntect the health of female employees, coverage that is sig-\nnificantly more costly than for a male employee. Ante, at\n39; see, e.g., Brief for HHS in No. 13–354, pp. 14–15.\nThere are many medical conditions for which pregnancy is\ncontraindicated. See, e.g., id., at 47. It is important to\nconfirm that a premise of the Court’s opinion is its as-\nsumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a\nlegitimate and compelling interest in the health of female\nemployees. Ante, at 40.\n                  Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\n   But the Government has not made the second showing\nrequired by RFRA, that the means it uses to regulate is\nthe least restrictive way to further its interest. As the\nCourt’s opinion explains, the record in these cases\nshows that there is an existing, recognized, workable, and\nalready-implemented framework to provide coverage. That\nframework is one that HHS has itself devised, that the\nplaintiffs have not criticized with a specific objection that\nhas been considered in detail by the courts in this litiga-\ntion, and that is less restrictive than the means challenged\nby the plaintiffs in these cases. Ante, at 9–10, and n. 9,\n43–44.\n   The means the Government chose is the imposition of a\ndirect mandate on the employers in these cases. Ante, at\n8–9. But in other instances the Government has allowed\nthe same contraception coverage in issue here to be pro-\nvided to employees of nonprofit religious organizations, as\nan accommodation to the religious objections of those\nentities. See ante, at 9–10, and n. 9, 43–44. The accom-\nmodation works by requiring insurance companies to\ncover, without cost sharing, contraception coverage for\nfemale employees who wish it. That accommodation\nequally furthers the Government’s interest but does not\nimpinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See ante, at 44.\n   On this record and as explained by the Court, the Gov-\nernment has not met its burden of showing that it cannot\naccommodate the plaintiffs’ similar religious objections\nunder this established framework. RFRA is inconsis-\ntent with the insistence of an agency such as HHS on\ndistinguishing between different religious believers—bur-\ndening one while accommodating the other—when it\nmay treat both equally by offering both of them the same\naccommodation.\n   The parties who were the plaintiffs in the District\nCourts argue that the Government could pay for the\nmethods that are found objectionable.

In discussing this alternative,\nthe Court does not address whether the proper response to\na legitimate claim for freedom in the health care arena is\nfor the Government to create an additional program.\nAnte, at 41–43. The Court properly does not resolve\nwhether one freedom should be protected by creating\nincentives for additional government constraints. In these\ncases, it is the Court’s understanding that an accommoda-\ntion may be made to the employers without imposition of a\nwhole new program or burden on the Government. As the\nCourt makes clear, this is not a case where it can be estab-\nlished that it is difficult to accommodate the government’s\ninterest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is already\nin place.

Among the reasons the United States is\nso open, so tolerant, and so free is that no person may be\nrestricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\nher religion. Yet neither may that same exercise unduly\nrestrict other persons, such as employees, in protecting\ntheir own interests, interests the law deems compelling.\nIn these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities\nare at hand in the existing accommodation the Govern-\nment has designed, identified, and used for circumstances\nclosely parallel to those presented here. RFRA requires\nthe Government to use this less restrictive means. As the\nCourt explains, this existing model, designed precisely for\nthis problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant\ncases from many others in which it is more difficult and\nexpensive to accommodate a governmental program to\ncountless religious claims based on an alleged statutory\nright of free exercise.

In the Court’s view, RFRA demands accommo-\ndation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no\nmatter the impact that accommodation may have on third\nparties who do not share the corporation owners’ religious\nfaith—in these cases, thousands of women employed by\nHobby Lobby and Conestoga or dependents of persons\nthose corporations employ.

The scheme had a large gap, how-\never; it left out preventive services that “many women’s\nhealth advocates and medical professionals believe are\ncritically important.” 155 Cong. Rec. 28841 (2009) (state-\nment of Sen. Boxer). To correct this oversight, Senator\nBarbara Mikulski introduced the Women’s Health\nAmendment, which added to the ACA’s minimum coverage\nrequirements a new category of preventive services specific\nto women’s health.\n   Women paid significantly more than men for preventive\ncare, the amendment’s proponents noted; in fact, cost\n\n——————\n  2 See 42 U.

Mikulski) (“co-\npayments are [often] so high that [women] avoid getting\n[preventive and screening services] in the first place”).\nAnd increased access to contraceptive services, the spon-\nsors comprehended, would yield important public health\ngains. See, e.g., id., at 29768 (statement of Sen.

The\nreport noted the disproportionate burden women carried\nfor comprehensive health services and the adverse health\nconsequences of excluding contraception from preventive\ncare available to employees without cost sharing. See,\ne.g., id., at 19 (“[W]omen are consistently more likely than\nmen to report a wide range of cost-related barriers to\nreceiving . . . medical tests and treatments and to filling\nprescriptions for themselves and their families.”); id., at\n103–104, 107 (pregnancy may be contraindicated for\nwomen with certain medical conditions, for example, some\ncongenital heart diseases, pulmonary hypertension, and\nMarfan syndrome, and contraceptives may be used to\nreduce risk of endometrial cancer, among other serious\nmedical conditions); id., at 103 (women with unintended\npregnancies are more likely to experience depression and\nanxiety, and their children face “increased odds of preterm\nbirth and low birth weight”).\n   In line with the IOM’s suggestions, the HRSA adopted\nguidelines recommending coverage of “[a]ll [FDA-]\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures,\nand patient education and counseling for all women with\nreproductive capacity.”4 Thereafter, HHS, the Depart-\nment of Labor, and the Department of Treasury promul-\ngated regulations requiring group health plans to include\ncoverage of the contraceptive services recommended in the\n——————\n  4 HRSA, HHS, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, available at\n\nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 27, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file),\nreprinted in App. to Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–354, pp. 43–44a.\nSee also 77 Fed.

The First Amendment is not offended, Smith held,\nwhen “prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the\nobject of [governmental regulation] but merely the inci-\ndental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid\nprovision.” Id., at 878; see id., at 878–879 (“an individ-\nual’s religious beliefs [do not] excuse him from compliance\nwith an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the\nState is free to regulate”). The ACA’s contraceptive cover-\nage requirement applies generally, it is “otherwise valid,”\nit trains on women’s well being, not on the exercise\nof religion, and any effect it has on such exercise is\nincidental.\n  Even if Smith did not control, the Free Exercise Clause\nwould not require the exemption Hobby Lobby and Cones-\ntoga seek. Accommodations to religious beliefs or obser-\nvances, the Court has clarified, must not significantly\nimpinge on the interests of third parties.8\n——————\n   8 See Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.

See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–111, p. 12 (1993)\n(hereinafter Senate Report) (RFRA’s purpose was “only to\noverturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith,” not to\n“unsettle other areas of the law.”); 139 Cong. Rec. 26178\n(1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (RFRA was “designed\nto restore the compelling interest test for deciding free\nexercise claims.”). In line with this restorative purpose,\nCongress expected courts considering RFRA claims to\n“look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for\nguidance.” Senate Report 8. See also H. R. Rep. No. 103–\n88, pp. 6–7 (1993) (hereinafter House Report) (same).

See ante, at 6, n. 3, 7,\n17, 25–27. To support its conception of RFRA as a meas-\nure detached from this Court’s decisions, one that sets a\nnew course, the Court points first to the Religious Land\nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),\n42 U. S. C. §2000cc et seq., which altered RFRA’s defini-\ntion of the term “exercise of religion.” RFRA, as originally\nenacted, defined that term to mean “the exercise of reli-\ngion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”\n§2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). See ante, at 6–7. As amended by\nRLUIPA, RFRA’s definition now includes “any exercise of\nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a\nsystem of religious belief.” §2000bb–2(4) (2012 ed.) (cross-\nreferencing §2000cc–5). That definitional change, accord-\ning to the Court, reflects “an obvious effort to effect a\ncomplete separation from First Amendment case law.”\nAnte, at 7.\n   The Court’s reading is not plausible. RLUIPA’s altera-\ntion clarifies that courts should not question the centrality\nof a particular religious exercise. But the amendment in\nno way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class\nof entities qualified to mount religious accommodation\nclaims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to in-\nquire whether a government action substantially burdens\na religious exercise. See Rasul v. Myers, 563 F. 3d 527,\n535 (CADC 2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (“There is no\ndoubt that RLUIPA’s drafters, in changing the definition\nof ‘exercise of religion,’ wanted to broaden the scope of the\nkinds of practices protected by RFRA, not increase the\nuniverse of individuals protected by RFRA.”); H.

Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997)). See also ante, at 6,\nn. 3. But as RFRA’s statements of purpose and legislative\nhistory make clear, Congress intended only to restore, not\nto scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had\napplied it pre-Smith. See supra, at 8–9. See also Senate\nReport 9 (RFRA’s “compelling interest test generally\nshould not be construed more stringently or more leniently\nthan it was prior to Smith.”); House Report 7 (same).\n  The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this\nCourt’s pre-Smith case law as including within the “com-\npelling interest test” a “least restrictive means” require-\nment.

And the view that\nthe pre-Smith test included a “least restrictive means”\nrequirement had been aired in testimony before the Sen-\nate Judiciary Committee by experts on religious freedom.\nSee, e.g., Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 78–79 (1993)\n(statement of Prof. Douglas Laycock).\n   Our decision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the\nleast restrictive means requirement “was not used in the\npre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.” See\nante, at 6, n. 3, 17, n. 18. As just indicated, however, that\nstatement does not accurately convey the Court’s pre-\nSmith jurisprudence. See Sherbert, 374 U.

That task, in\nview of the positions taken by the Court, requires consid-\neration of several questions, each potentially dispositive of\nHobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s claims: Do for-profit corpo-\nrations rank among “person[s]” who “exercise . . . reli-\ngion”? Assuming that they do, does the contraceptive\ncoverage requirement “substantially burden” their reli-\ngious exercise? If so, is the requirement “in furtherance of\na compelling government interest”? And last, does the\nrequirement represent the least restrictive means for\nfurthering that interest?\n  Misguided by its errant premise that RFRA moved\nbeyond the pre-Smith case law, the Court falters at each\nstep of its analysis.\n                             1\n   RFRA’s compelling interest test, as noted, see supra, at\n8, applies to government actions that “substantially bur-\nden a person’s exercise of religion.” 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–\n1(a) (emphasis added). This reference, the Court submits,\nincorporates the definition of “person” found in the Dic-\ntionary Act, 1 U. S. C. §1, which extends to “corporations,\ncompanies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and\njoint stock companies, as well as individuals.” See ante, at\n19–20. The Dictionary Act’s definition, however, controls\nonly where “context” does not “indicat[e] otherwise.” §1.\nHere, context does so indicate. RFRA speaks of “a person’s\nexercise of religion.” 42 U.

There is in that case law no\nsupport for the notion that free exercise rights pertain to\nfor-profit corporations.\n  Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized\na for-profit corporation’s qualification for a religious ex-\nemption from a generally applicable law, whether under\nthe Free Exercise Clause or RFRA.13 The absence of such\nprecedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of\nreligion is characteristic of natural persons, not artificial\nlegal entities. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly\ntwo centuries ago, a corporation is “an artificial being,\ninvisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of\nlaw.” Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4\nWheat. 518, 636 (1819).

The suggestion is barely there. True, one of the five\nchallengers to the Sunday closing law assailed in Gallagher was a\ncorporation owned by four Orthodox Jews.

Board of Equalization of Cal., 493 U. S. 378 (1990).\n   15 Typically, Congress has accorded to organizations religious in char-\n\nacter religion-based exemptions from statutes of general application.\nE.g., 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1(a) (Title VII exemption from prohibition\nagainst employment discrimination based on religion for “a religious\ncorporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect\nto the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform\nwork connected with the carrying on . . . of its activities”); 42 U. S. C.\n§12113(d)(1) (parallel exemption in Americans With Disabilities Act of\n1990). It can scarcely be maintained that RFRA enlarges these exemp-\ntions to allow Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to hire only persons who\nshare the religious beliefs of the Greens or Hahns. Nor does the Court\nsuggest otherwise. Cf. ante, at 28.\n   The Court does identify two statutory exemptions it reads to cover\nfor-profit corporations, 42 U. S. C. §§300a–7(b)(2) and 238n(a), and\ninfers from them that “Congress speaks with specificity when it intends\na religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit corporations,”\nante, at 28. The Court’s inference is unwarranted. The exemptions the\nCourt cites cover certain medical personnel who object to performing or\nassisting with abortions. Cf. ante, at 28, n. 27 (“the protection provided\nby §238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by\n16           BURWELL v.

Not so of for-profit corporations.\nWorkers who sustain the operations of those corporations\ncommonly are not drawn from one religious community.\nIndeed, by law, no religion-based criterion can restrict the\n\n——————\nRFRA”). Notably, the Court does not assert that these exemptions have\nin fact been afforded to for-profit corporations. See §238n(c) (“health\ncare entity” covered by exemption is a term defined to include “an\nindividual physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a\nparticipant in a program of training in the health professions”); Tozzi,\nWhither Free Exercise: Employment Division v. Smith and the Rebirth\nof State Constitutional Free Exercise Clause Jurisprudence?, 48 J.\nCatholic Legal Studies 269, 296, n. 133 (2009) (“Catholic physicians,\nbut not necessarily hospitals, . . . may be able to invoke [§238n(a)]\n. . . .”); cf. S. 137, 113th Cong., 1st Sess. (2013) (as introduced) (Abortion\nNon-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would amend the definition of\n“health care entity” in §238n to include “hospital[s],” “health insurance\nplan[s],” and other health care facilities). These provisions are reveal-\ning in a way that detracts from one of the Court’s main arguments.\nThey show that Congress is not content to rest on the Dictionary Act\nwhen it wishes to ensure that particular entities are among those\neligible for a religious accommodation.\n    Moreover, the exemption codified in §238n(a) was not enacted until\nthree years after RFRA’s passage. See Omnibus Consolidated Rescis-\nsions and Appropriations Act of 1996, §515, 110 Stat. 1321–245. If, as\nthe Court believes, RFRA opened all statutory schemes to religion-\nbased challenges by for-profit corporations, there would be no need for a\nstatute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.\n    16 That is not to say that a category of plaintiffs, such as resident\n\naliens, may bring RFRA claims only if this Court expressly “addressed\ntheir [free-exercise] rights before Smith.” Ante, at 27. Continuing with\nthe Court’s example, resident aliens, unlike corporations, are flesh-and-\nblood individuals who plainly count as persons sheltered by the First\nAmendment, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 271\n(1990) (citing Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135, 148 (1945)), and\na fortiori, RFRA.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

S. 63, 80–81 (1977) (Title\nVII requires reasonable accommodation of an employee’s\nreligious exercise, but such accommodation must not come\n“at the expense of other[ employees]”). The distinction\nbetween a community made up of believers in the same\nreligion and one embracing persons of diverse beliefs, clear\nas it is, constantly escapes the Court’s attention.17 One\ncan only wonder why the Court shuts this key difference\nfrom sight.\n   Reading RFRA, as the Court does, to require extension\nof religion-based exemptions to for-profit corporations\nsurely is not grounded in the pre-Smith precedent Con-\ngress sought to preserve. Had Congress intended RFRA to\ninitiate a change so huge, a clarion statement to that\neffect likely would have been made in the legislation. See\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n468 (2001) (Congress does not “hide elephants in mouse-\nholes”). The text of RFRA makes no such statement and\nthe legislative history does not so much as mention for-\nprofit corporations.

For-profit corporations\ndo not fit that bill. Moreover, history is not on the Court’s\nside. Recognition of the discrete characters of “ecclesiasti-\ncal and lay” corporations dates back to Blackstone, see 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 458\n(1765), and was reiterated by this Court centuries before\nthe enactment of the Internal Revenue Code. See Terrett\nv.

See also ante, at 16–17. But even\naccepting, arguendo, the premise that unincorporated\nbusiness enterprises may gain religious accommodations\nunder the Free Exercise Clause, the Court’s conclusion is\nunsound. In a sole proprietorship, the business and its\nowner are one and the same. By incorporating a business,\nhowever, an individual separates herself from the entity\nand escapes personal responsibility for the entity’s obliga-\ntions. One might ask why the separation should hold only\nwhen it serves the interest of those who control the corpo-\nration. In any event, Braunfeld is hardly impressive\nauthority for the entitlement Hobby Lobby and Conestoga\nseek. The free exercise claim asserted there was promptly\nrejected on the merits.\n   The Court’s determination that RFRA extends to for-\nprofit corporations is bound to have untoward effects.\nAlthough the Court attempts to cabin its language to\nclosely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations\nof any size, public or private.19 Little doubt that RFRA\n——————\n  19 The Court does not even begin to explain how one might go about\nascertaining the religious scruples of a corporation where shares are\nsold to the public. No need to speculate on that, the Court says, for “it\nseems unlikely” that large corporations “will often assert RFRA\nclaims.” Ante, at 29. Perhaps so, but as Hobby Lobby’s case demon-\nstrates, such claims are indeed pursued by large corporations, employ-\ning thousands of persons of different faiths, whose ownership is not\ndiffuse. “Closely held” is not synonymous with “small.” Hobby Lobby is\n20          BURWELL v.

S. C.\n§2000bb–1(a). Congress no doubt meant the modifier\n“substantially” to carry weight. In the original draft of\nRFRA, the word “burden” appeared unmodified. The word\n“substantially” was inserted pursuant to a clarifying\namendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Hatch. See\n——————\nhardly the only enterprise of sizable scale that is family owned or\nclosely held.

See Forbes, America’s Larg-\nest Private Companies 2013, available at http://www.forbes.com/\nlargest-private-companies/.\n   Nor does the Court offer any instruction on how to resolve the dis-\nputes that may crop up among corporate owners over religious values\nand accommodations. The Court is satisfied that “[s]tate corporate law\nprovides a ready means for resolving any conflicts,” ante, at 30, but the\nauthorities cited in support of that proposition are hardly helpful.

In proposing the amendment,\nSenator Kennedy stated that RFRA, in accord with the\nCourt’s pre-Smith case law, “does not require the Govern-\nment to justify every action that has some effect on reli-\ngious exercise.” Ibid.\n  The Court barely pauses to inquire whether any burden\nimposed by the contraceptive coverage requirement is\nsubstantial. Instead, it rests on the Greens’ and Hahns’\n“belie[f ] that providing the coverage demanded by the\nHHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an\nembryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for\nthem to provide the coverage.” Ante, at 36.20 I agree with\nthe Court that the Green and Hahn families’ religious\nconvictions regarding contraception are sincerely held.\nSee Thomas, 450 U. S., at 715 (courts are not to question\nwhere an individual “dr[aws] the line” in defining which\npractices run afoul of her religious beliefs). See also 42\nU. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), 2000bb–2(4), 2000cc–5(7)(A).21\nBut those beliefs, however deeply held, do not suffice to\nsustain a RFRA claim. RFRA, properly understood, dis-\ntinguishes between “factual allegations that [plaintiffs’]\n——————\n   20 The Court dismisses the argument, advanced by some amici, that\n\nthe $2,000-per-employee tax charged to certain employers that fail to\nprovide health insurance is less than the average cost of offering health\ninsurance, noting that the Government has not provided the statistics\nthat could support such an argument. See ante, at 32–34. The Court\noverlooks, however, that it is not the Government’s obligation to prove\nthat an asserted burden is insubstantial. Instead, it is incumbent upon\nplaintiffs to demonstrate, in support of a RFRA claim, the substantial-\nity of the alleged burden.\n   21 The Court levels a criticism that is as wrongheaded as can be. In\n\nno way does the dissent “tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.”\nAnte, at 37. Right or wrong in this domain is a judgment no Member of\nthis Court, or any civil court, is authorized or equipped to make.

See supra, at 7–8; infra, at 27.\n22         BURWELL v.

Kaemmerling v.\nLappin, 553 F. 3d 669, 679 (CADC 2008).\n   That distinction is a facet of the pre-Smith jurispru-\ndence RFRA incorporates. Bowen v. Roy, 476 U. S. 693\n(1986), is instructive. There, the Court rejected a free\nexercise challenge to the Government’s use of a Native\nAmerican child’s Social Security number for purposes of\nadministering benefit programs. Without questioning the\nsincerity of the father’s religious belief that “use of [his\ndaughter’s Social Security] number may harm [her] spirit,”\nthe Court concluded that the Government’s internal\nuses of that number “place[d] [no] restriction on what [the\nfather] may believe or what he may do.” Id., at 699.\nRecognizing that the father’s “religious views may not\naccept” the position that the challenged uses concerned\nonly the Government’s internal affairs, the Court ex-\nplained that “for the adjudication of a constitutional claim,\nthe Constitution, rather than an individual’s religion,\nmust supply the frame of reference.” Id., at 700–701, n. 6.\nSee also Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680, 699\n(1989) (distinguishing between, on the one hand, “ques-\ntion[s] [of] the centrality of particular beliefs or practices\nto a faith, or the validity of particular litigants’ interpreta-\ntions of those creeds,” and, on the other, “whether the\nalleged burden imposed [by the challenged government\naction] is a substantial one”). Inattentive to this guidance,\ntoday’s decision elides entirely the distinction between the\nsincerity of a challenger’s religious belief and the substan-\ntiality of the burden placed on the challenger.\n   Undertaking the inquiry that the Court forgoes, I would\nconclude that the connection between the families’ reli-\ngious objections and the contraceptive coverage require-\nment is too attenuated to rank as substantial.

Instead, it calls on the companies covered\nby the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated\nfunds that finance a wide variety of benefits under com-\nprehensive health plans. Those plans, in order to comply\nwith the ACA, see supra, at 3–6, must offer contraceptive\ncoverage without cost sharing, just as they must cover an\narray of other preventive services.\n  Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits\nunder the plans are made not by Hobby Lobby or Cones-\ntoga, but by the covered employees and dependents, in\nconsultation with their health care providers. Should an\nemployee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious\nbeliefs of the Greens and Hahns, she is of course under no\ncompulsion to use the contraceptives in question. But\n“[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physi-\ncian—be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or have\na hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense [her employ-\ner’s] decision or action.” Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F. 3d 850,\n865 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J., dissenting). It is doubtful that\nCongress, when it specified that burdens must be “sub-\nstantia[l],” had in mind a linkage thus interrupted by\nindependent decisionmakers (the woman and her health\ncounselor) standing between the challenged government\naction and the religious exercise claimed to be infringed.\nAny decision to use contraceptives made by a woman\ncovered under Hobby Lobby’s or Conestoga’s plan will not\nbe propelled by the Government, it will be the wo-\nman’s autonomous choice, informed by the physician she\nconsults.\n                          3\n  Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and\nConestoga meet the substantial burden requirement, the\nGovernment has shown that the contraceptive coverage\n24          BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                      GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfor which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests\nin public health and women’s well being. Those interests\nare concrete, specific, and demonstrated by a wealth of\nempirical evidence. To recapitulate, the mandated contra-\nception coverage enables women to avoid the health prob-\nlems unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their\nchildren. See IOM Report 102–107. The coverage helps\nsafeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may\nbe hazardous, even life threatening. See Brief for Ameri-\ncan College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as\nAmici Curiae 14–15.

Reg. 39872 (2013); IOM Report 107.\n   That Hobby Lobby and Conestoga resist coverage for\nonly 4 of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives does not\nlessen these compelling interests. Notably, the corpora-\ntions exclude intrauterine devices (IUDs), devices signifi-\ncantly more effective, and significantly more expensive\nthan other contraceptive methods. See id., at 105.22\nMoreover, the Court’s reasoning appears to permit com-\nmercial enterprises like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to\nexclude from their group health plans all forms of contra-\nceptives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39 (counsel for Hobby\nLobby acknowledged that his “argument . . . would apply\njust as well if the employer said ‘no contraceptives’ ” (in-\nternal quotation marks added)).\n   Perhaps the gravity of the interests at stake has led the\n——————\n  22 IUDs, which are among the most reliable forms of contraception,\n\ngenerally cost women more than $1,000 when the expenses of the office\nvisit and insertion procedure are taken into account.

Once speci-\nfied changes are made, grandfathered status ceases. See\n45 CFR §147.140(g). Hobby Lobby’s own situation is\nillustrative. By the time this litigation commenced, Hobby\nLobby did not have grandfathered status. Asked why by\nthe District Court, Hobby Lobby’s counsel explained that\nthe “grandfathering requirements mean that you can’t\nmake a whole menu of changes to your plan that involve\nthings like the amount of co-pays, the amount of co-\ninsurance, deductibles, that sort of thing.” App. in No. 13–\n354, pp. 39–40.

In short, far from\nranking as a categorical exemption, the grandfathering\nprovision is “temporary, intended to be a means for gradu-\nally transitioning employers into mandatory coverage.”\nGilardi, 733 F. 3d, at 1241 (Edwards, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part).\n   The Court ultimately acknowledges a critical point:\nRFRA’s application “must take adequate account of the\nburdens a requested accommodation may impose on non-\nbeneficiaries.” Ante, at 42, n. 37 (quoting Cutter v. Wil­\nkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 720 (2005); emphasis added). No\ntradition, and no prior decision under RFRA, allows a\nreligion-based exemption when the accommodation would\nbe harmful to others—here, the very persons the contra-\nceptive coverage requirement was designed to protect. Cf.\nsupra, at 7–8; Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 177\n(1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (“[The] limitations which of\nnecessity bound religious freedom . . . begin to operate\nwhenever activities begin to affect or collide with liberties\nof others or of the public.”).\n                              4\n  After assuming the existence of compelling government\ninterests, the Court holds that the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement fails to satisfy RFRA’s least restrictive means\ntest. But the Government has shown that there is no less\nrestrictive, equally effective means that would both (1)\nsatisfy the challengers’ religious objections to providing\n——————\nstates that, “[g]iven the nature of employers’ needs to meet changing\neconomic and staffing circumstances, and to adjust insurance coverage\naccordingly, the actual benefit of the ‘grandfather’ exclusion is de\nminimis and transitory at best.” Brief for National Religious Broad-\ncasters as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–354, p. 28.\n28           BURWELL v.

A “least restrictive means” cannot require employ-\nees to relinquish benefits accorded them by federal law in\norder to ensure that their commercial employers can\nadhere unreservedly to their religious tenets. See supra,\nat 7–8, 27.25\n  Then let the government pay (rather than the employees\nwho do not share their employer’s faith), the Court sug-\ngests. “The most straightforward [alternative],” the Court\nasserts, “would be for the Government to assume the cost\nof providing . . . contraceptives . . . to any women who are\nunable to obtain them under their health-insurance poli-\ncies due to their employers’ religious objections.” Ante, at\n41.

Note, too, that Congress declined to write into law the\npreferential treatment Hobby Lobby and Conestoga de-\nscribe as a less restrictive alternative. See supra, at 6.\n  And where is the stopping point to the “let the govern-\nment pay” alternative? Suppose an employer’s sincerely\nheld religious belief is offended by health coverage of\nvaccines, or paying the minimum wage, see Tony and\nSusan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor, 471 U. S.\n290, 303 (1985), or according women equal pay for sub-\nstantially similar work, see Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist\nChurch, 899 F. 2d 1389, 1392 (CA4 1990)? Does it rank as\na less restrictive alternative to require the government to\nprovide the money or benefit to which the employer has\na religion-based objection?26 Because the Court cannot\neasily answer that question, it proposes something else:\nExtension to commercial enterprises of the accommodation\nalready afforded to nonprofit religion-based organizations.\nSee ante, at 3–4, 9–10, 43–45. “At a minimum,” according\nto the Court, such an approach would not “impinge on\n[Hobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s] religious belief.” Ante, at\n44. I have already discussed the “special solicitude” gen-\nerally accorded nonprofit religion-based organizations that\nexist to serve a community of believers, solicitude never\nbefore accorded to commercial enterprises comprising\nemployees of diverse faiths.

Counsel for Hobby\nLobby was similarly noncommittal. Asked at oral argu-\nment whether the Court-proposed alternative was ac-\nceptable,27 counsel responded: “We haven’t been offered\nthat accommodation, so we haven’t had to decide what\nkind of objection, if any, we would make to that.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 86–87.\n   Conestoga suggests that, if its employees had to acquire\nand pay for the contraceptives (to which the corporation\nobjects) on their own, a tax credit would qualify as a less\nrestrictive alternative. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–\n356, p. 64. A tax credit, of course, is one variety of “let the\ngovernment pay.” In addition to departing from the exist-\ning employer-based system of health insurance, Conesto-\nga’s alternative would require a woman to reach into her\nown pocket in the first instance, and it would do nothing\nfor the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.\n   In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish,\n——————\n  27 On brief, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga barely addressed the exten-\nsion solution, which would bracket commercial enterprises with non-\nprofit religion-based organizations for religious accommodations pur-\nposes. The hesitation is understandable, for challenges to the adequacy\nof the accommodation accorded religious nonprofit organizations are\ncurrently sub judice. See, e.g., Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\nAged v. Sebelius, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2013 WL 6839900 (Colo., Dec. 27,\n2013), injunction pending appeal granted, 571 U. S. ___ (2014). At\nanother point in today’s decision, the Court refuses to consider an\nargument neither “raised below [nor] advanced in this Court by any\nparty,” giving Hobby Lobby and Conestoga “[no] opportunity to respond\nto [that] novel claim.” Ante, at 33. Yet the Court is content to decide\nthis case (and this case only) on the ground that HHS could make an\naccommodation never suggested in the parties’ presentations. RFRA\ncannot sensibly be read to “requir[e] the government to . . . refute each\nand every conceivable alternative regulation,” United States v. Wilgus,\n638 F. 3d 1274, 1289 (CA10 2011), especially where the alternative on\nwhich the Court seizes was not pressed by any challenger.\n                      Cite as: 573 U.

Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982).\nLee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry,\nwas a member of the Old Order Amish. He sincerely\nbelieved that withholding Social Security taxes from his\nemployees or paying the employer’s share of such taxes\nwould violate the Amish faith. This Court held that,\nalthough the obligations imposed by the Social Security\nsystem conflicted with Lee’s religious beliefs, the burden\nwas not unconstitutional. Id., at 260–261. See also id., at\n258 (recognizing the important governmental interest in\nproviding a “nationwide . . . comprehensive insurance\nsystem with a variety of benefits available to all partici-\npants, with costs shared by employers and employees”).28\nThe Government urges that Lee should control the chal-\nlenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. See Brief\nfor Respondents in No. 13–356, p. 18. In contrast, today’s\nCourt dismisses Lee as a tax case. See ante, at 46–47.\nIndeed, it was a tax case and the Court in Lee homed in on\n“[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate religious\nbeliefs in the area of taxation.” 455 U. S., at 259.\n   But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot\nconfine to tax cases. “When followers of a particular sect\nenter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,” the\nCourt observed, “the limits they accept on their own con-\nduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\n——————\n  28 Asa sole proprietor, Lee was subject to personal liability for violat-\ning the law of general application he opposed. His claim to a religion-\nbased exemption would have been even thinner had he conducted his\nbusiness as a corporation, thus avoiding personal liability.\n32           BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsuperimposed on statutory schemes which are binding on\nothers in that activity.” Id., at 261. The statutory scheme\nof employer-based comprehensive health coverage in-\nvolved in these cases is surely binding on others engaged\nin the same trade or business as the corporate challengers\nhere, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Further, the Court\nrecognized in Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption\nto a commercial employer would “operat[e] to impose the\nemployer’s religious faith on the employees.” Ibid.29 No\ndoubt the Greens and Hahns and all who share their\nbeliefs may decline to acquire for themselves the contra-\nceptives in question. But that choice may not be imposed\non employees who hold other beliefs. Working for Hobby\nLobby or Conestoga, in other words, should not deprive\nemployees of the preventive care available to workers at\nthe shop next door,30 at least in the absence of directions\nfrom the Legislature or Administration to do so.\n   Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress\nor the regulatory authority, and not this Court? Hobby\nLobby and Conestoga surely do not stand alone as com-\nmercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally\napplicable laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. See,\ne.g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 256 F. Supp.\n——————\n  29 Congress  amended the Social Security Act in response to Lee. The\namended statute permits Amish sole proprietors and partnerships (but\nnot Amish-owned corporations) to obtain an exemption from the obliga-\ntion to pay Social Security taxes only for employees who are co-\nreligionists and who likewise seek an exemption and agree to give up\ntheir Social Security benefits. See 26 U. S. C. §3127(a)(2), (b)(1). Thus,\nemployers with sincere religious beliefs have no right to a religion-\nbased exemption that would deprive employees of Social Security\nbenefits without the employee’s consent—an exemption analogous to\nthe one Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek here.\n   30 Cf. Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor, 471\n\nU.

Not much help there for the lower courts bound by\ntoday’s decision.\n   The Court, however, sees nothing to worry about. To-\nday’s cases, the Court concludes, are “concerned solely\nwith the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not\nbe understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate\nmust necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s\nreligious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as\nimmunizations, may be supported by different interests\n(for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious\ndiseases) and may involve different arguments about the\nleast restrictive means of providing them.” Ante, at 46.\nBut the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the\ninterest in women’s health and well being is compelling\nand has come up with no means adequate to serve that\ninterest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Wom-\nen’s Health Amendment.\n   There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the\ncourts “out of the business of evaluating the relative mer-\nits of differing religious claims,” Lee, 455 U. S., at 263, n. 2\n(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or the sincerity with\nwhich an asserted religious belief is held.
