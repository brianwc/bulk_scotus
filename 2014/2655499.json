SIEGEL, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–5196. Argued January 13, 2014—Decided March 4, 2014\nPetitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He valued his Califor-\n  nia home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was cov-\n  ered by California’s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from\n  the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(A). He also\n  claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens—one of which was in fa-\n  vor of “Lin’s Mortgage & Associates”—exceeded the home’s nonex-\n  empt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors. Re-\n  spondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the “Lin”\n  lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litiga-\n  tion ensued when a supposed “Lili Lin” in China claimed to be the\n  beneficiary of Law’s deed of trust. Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court\n  concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his\n  equity in the house. It thus granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge”\n  Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to\n  defray attorney’s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law’s fraudu-\n  lent misrepresentations. The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n  Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when\n it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s homestead exemption\n be made available to pay Siegel’s attorney’s fees. Pp. 5–12.\n     (a) A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to “carry out”\n the provisions of the Code, 11 U. S. C. §105(a), or its “inherent power\n . . . to sanction ‘abusive litigation practices,’ ” Marrama v. Citizens\n Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375–376, by taking action prohibited\n elsewhere in the Code. Here, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge”\n contravened §522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law\n to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate,\n §522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of\n2                              LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    any administrative expense,” §522(k), including attorney’s fees, see\n    §503(b)(2). The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court’s\n    authority under §105(a) and its inherent powers. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by\n    “surcharging” exempt property in response to a debtor’s misconduct\n    can coexist with §522. But insofar as that argument equates the sur-\n    charge with an outright denial of Law’s homestead exemption, it\n    founders on this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the home-\n    stead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.\n    And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge\n    an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644.\n    Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law’s entitle-\n    ment to the exemption, §522 specifies the criteria that render proper-\n    ty exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor’s invocation\n    of an exemption without a valid statutory basis. Federal courts may\n    apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law\n    itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemp-\n    tion on a ground not specified in the Code. Pp. 7–10.\n       (c) Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum\n    points toward a different result. There, the debtor’s bad faith kept\n    him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a\n    Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by §706(a). But that was be-\n    cause his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13,\n    and thus he could not satisfy §706(d), which expressly conditions\n    conversion on the debtor’s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.\n    Pp. 10–11.\n       (d) This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden\n    due to Law’s egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable re-\n    sults for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter\n    the balance that Congress struck in crafting §522.

ALFRED H. SIEGEL,\n             CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor may ex­\nempt certain assets from the bankruptcy estate. It further\nprovides that exempt assets generally are not liable for\nany expenses associated with administering the estate. In\nthis case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court none­\ntheless may order that a debtor’s exempt assets be used to\npay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the\ndebtor’s misconduct.\n                                I. Background\n                              A\n  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent\ndebtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidat­\ning his assets to pay his creditors. 11 U. S. C. §§704(a)(1),\n726, 727. The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chap­\nter 7 creates a bankruptcy “estate” generally comprising\nall of the debtor’s property. §541(a)(1). The estate is\nplaced under the control of a trustee, who is responsible\nfor managing liquidation of the estate’s assets and distri­\nbution of the proceeds. §704(a)(1). The Code authorizes\n2                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debtor to “exempt,” however, certain kinds of property\nfrom the estate, enabling him to retain those assets post­\nbankruptcy. §522(b)(1). Except in particular situations\nspecified in the Code, exempt property “is not liable” for\nthe payment of “any [prepetition] debt” or “any adminis­\ntrative expense.” §522(c), (k).\n   Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemp­\ntions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.\n§522(b)(2), (d). One, commonly known as the “homestead\nexemption,” protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debt­\nor’s residence. §522(d)(1) and note following §522; see\nOwen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). The debtor may\nelect, however, to forgo the §522(d) exemptions and in­\nstead claim whatever exemptions are available under\napplicable state or local law. §522(b)(3)(A). Some States\nprovide homestead exemptions that are more generous\nthan the federal exemption; some provide less generous\nversions; but nearly every State provides some type of\nhomestead exemption. See López, State Homestead Ex­\nemptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To\nClose the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L. J. 143, 149–165\n(2010) (listing state exemptions).\n                             B\n  Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed\nto serve as trustee. The estate’s only significant asset was\nLaw’s house in Hacienda Heights, California. On a sched­\nule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the\nhouse at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value\nwas covered by California’s homestead exemption. See\nCal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §704.730(a)(1) (West Supp.\n2014). He also reported that the house was subject to two\nvoluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in\nfavor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and\ndeed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of “Lin’s Mortgage &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociates.” Law thus represented that there was no\nequity in the house that could be recovered for his other\ncreditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the\nhouse’s nonexempt value.\n   If Law’s representations had been accurate, he presum­\nably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel\nwould have had no reason to pursue its sale. Instead, a\nfew months after Law’s petition was filed, Siegel initiated\nan adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of\n“Lin’s Mortgage & Associates” was fraudulent. The deed\nof trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in\n1999 and reflected a debt to someone named “Lili Lin.”\nNot one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ulti­\nmately responded to Siegel’s complaint. One, Lili Lin of\nArtesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law’s\nwho denied ever having loaned him money and described\nhis repeated efforts to involve her in various sham trans­\nactions relating to the disputed deed of trust. That Lili\nLin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaim­\ning any interest in the house. But that was not the end of\nthe matter, because the second “Lili Lin” claimed to be the\ntrue beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust. Over the\nnext five years, this “Lili Lin” managed—despite suppos­\nedly living in China and speaking no English—to engage\nin extensive and costly litigation, including several ap­\npeals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and\nSiegel’s subsequent sale of the house.\n   Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order\nconcluding that “no person named Lili Lin ever made a\nloan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.”\nIn re Law, 401 B. R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.). The\ncourt found that “the loan was a fiction, meant to preserve\n[Law’s] equity in his residence beyond what he was enti­\ntled to exempt” by perpetrating “a fraud on his creditors\nand the court.” Ibid. With regard to the second “Lili Lin,”\nthe court declared itself “unpersuaded that Lili Lin of\n4                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChina signed or approved any declaration or pleading\npurporting to come from her.” Ibid. Rather, it said, the\n“most plausible conclusion” was that Law himself had\n“authored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.”\nIbid. It also found that Law had submitted false evidence\n“in an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China—\nrather than Lili Lin of Artesia—was the true holder of the\nlien on his residence.” Id., at 452. The court determined\nthat Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney’s\nfees overcoming Law’s fraudulent misrepresentations. It\ntherefore granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge” the en­\ntirety of Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making\nthose funds available to defray Siegel’s attorney’s fees.\n   The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.\nBAP No. CC–09–1077–PaMkH, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7751415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Oct.\n22, 2009) ( per curiam).

Analysis\n                              A\n   A bankruptcy court has statutory authority to “issue\nany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or ap­\npropriate to carry out the provisions of ” the Bankruptcy\nCode. 11 U. S. C. §105(a). And it may also possess “inher­\nent power . . . to sanction ‘abusive litigation practices.’ ”\nMarrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375–\n376 (2007). But in exercising those statutory and inherent\npowers, a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific\nstatutory provisions.\n   It is hornbook law that §105(a) “does not allow the\nbankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other\nsections of the Bankruptcy Code.” 2 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶105.01[2], p. 105–6 (16th ed. 2013). Section 105(a) con­\nfers authority to “carry out” the provisions of the Code, but\nit is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the\nCode prohibits. That is simply an application of the axiom\nthat a statute’s general permission to take actions of a\ncertain type must yield to a specific prohibition found\nelsewhere. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550–551\n(1974); D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n206–208 (1932).1 Courts’ inherent sanctioning powers are\n——————\n  1 The second sentence of §105(a) adds little to the analysis. It states:\n\n“No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a\nparty in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,\nsua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary\nor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to\nprevent an abuse of process.” Even if the “abuse of process” language\nwere deemed to confer additional authority beyond that conferred by\nthe first sentence (which is doubtful), that general authority would also\nbe limited by more specific provisions of the Code.\n6                          LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlikewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and\nprohibitions. Degen v. United States, 517 U. S. 820, 823\n(1996); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991).\nWe have long held that “whatever equitable powers\nremain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be\nexercised within the confines of ” the Bankruptcy Code.\nNorwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197, 206\n(1988); see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530\nU. S. 15, 24–25 (2000); United States v. Noland, 517 U. S.\n535, 543 (1996); SEC v. United States Realty & Improve-\nment Co., 310 U. S. 434, 455 (1940).\n   Thus, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge” was unau­\nthorized if it contravened a specific provision of the Code.\nWe conclude that it did. Section 522 (by reference to\nCalifornia law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity\nin his home from the bankruptcy estate. §522(b)(3)(A).\nAnd it made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of any\nadministrative expense.” §522(k).2 The reasonable attor­\nney’s fees Siegel incurred defeating the “Lili Lin” lien were\nindubitably an administrative expense, as a short march\nthrough a few statutory cross-references makes plain:\nSection 503(b)(2) provides that administrative expenses\ninclude “compensation . . . awarded under” §330(a);\n§330(a)(1) authorizes “reasonable compensation for actual,\nnecessary services rendered” by a “professional person\nemployed under” §327; and §327(a) authorizes the trustee\nto “employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist\nthe trustee in carrying out the trustee’s duties under this\ntitle.” Siegel argues that even though attorney’s fees\nincurred responding to a debtor’s fraud qualify as “admin­\nistrative expenses” for purposes of determining the trus­\n——————\n  2 The statute’s general rule that exempt assets are not liable for\n\nadministrative expenses is subject to two narrow exceptions, both per­\ntaining to the use of exempt assets to pay expenses associated with the\navoidance of certain voidable transfers of exempt property. §522(k)(1)–\n(2). Neither of those exceptions is relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntee’s right to reimbursement under §503(b), they do not so\nqualify for purposes of §522(k); but he gives us no reason\nto depart from the “ ‘normal rule of statutory construc­\ntion’ ” that words repeated in different parts of the same\nstatute generally have the same meaning. See Depart-\nment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n332, 342 (1994) (quoting Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury,\n475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986)).\n   The Bankruptcy Court thus violated §522’s express\nterms when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s\nhomestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel’s\nattorney’s fees, an administrative expense. In doing so,\nthe court exceeded the limits of its authority under §105(a)\nand its inherent powers.\n                             B\n   Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy\ncourt’s §105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised\nin contravention of the Code. Instead, his main argument\nis that the Bankruptcy Court’s surcharge did not contra­\nvene §522. That statute, Siegel contends, “establish[es]\nthe procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemp­\ntions” but “contains no directive requiring [courts] to allow\n[an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.” Brief for\nRespondent 35. Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable\npower in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by\n“surcharging” the exempt property in response to the\ndebtor’s misconduct can coexist comfortably with §522.\nThe United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees,\narguing that §522 “neither gives debtors an absolute right\nto retain exempt property nor limits a court’s authority to\nimpose an equitable surcharge on such property.” Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the\nBankruptcy Court’s surcharge with an outright denial of\nLaw’s homestead exemption, their arguments founder\n8                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nupon this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel stated that because no one “timely op­\npose[d] [Law]’s homestead exemption claim,” the exemp­\ntion “became final” before the Bankruptcy Court imposed\nthe surcharge. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7751415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. We have held\nthat a trustee’s failure to make a timely objection prevents\nhim from challenging an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644 (1992).\n   But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have\nrevisited Law’s entitlement to the exemption, §522 does\nnot give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions\nbased on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.\nRather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that\nwill render property exempt. See §522(b), (d). Siegel\ninsists that because §522(b) says that the debtor “may\nexempt” certain property, rather than that he “shall be\nentitled” to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or\ndeny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.\nBut the subject of “may exempt” in §522(b) is the debtor,\nnot the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests\ndiscretion. A debtor need not invoke an exemption to\nwhich the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court\nmay not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid\nstatutory basis for doing so.\n   Moreover, §522 sets forth a number of carefully cali­\nbrated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to\nthe debtor’s misconduct. For example, §522(c) makes\nexempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition\ndebts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in\nconnection with student loans, and other specified types of\nwrongdoing. Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claim­\ning a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the\nhomestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10\nyears “with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a credi­\ntor.” And §522(q) caps a debtor’s homestead exemption at\napproximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en­\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The Code’s meticulous—not to say mind-numbingly\ndetailed—enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to\nthose exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized\nto create additional exceptions. See Hillman v. Maretta,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28–29 (2001).\n   Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed\nauthority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from\namending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is\nmuch the same thing) based on the debtor’s fraudulent\nconcealment of the asset alleged to be exempt. See, e.g.,\nIn re Yonikus, 996 F. 2d 866, 872–873 (CA7 1993); In re\nDoan, 672 F. 2d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) ( per curiam); Stew-\nart v. Ganey, 116 F. 2d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940). He sug­\ngests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable\npower in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a\ndebtor’s bad-faith conduct. For the reasons we have given,\nthe Bankruptcy Code admits no such power. It is of course\ntrue that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption,\nthe exemption’s scope is determined by state law, which\nmay provide that certain types of debtor misconduct war­\nrant denial of the exemption. E.g., In re Sholdan, 217\nF. 3d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶522.08[1]–[2], at 522–45 to 522–47. Some of the early\ndecisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Cir­\ncuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts\napplied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.\n10                     LAW v.

But federal law\nprovides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an\nexemption on a ground not specified in the Code.\n                             C\n   Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which\nSiegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point\ntoward a different result. The question there was whether\na debtor’s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bank­\nruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor’s bankruptcy\nfrom a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization\nunder Chapter 13. Although §706(a) of the Code gave the\ndebtor a right to convert the case, §706(d) “expressly\nconditioned” that right on the debtor’s “ability to qualify as\na ‘debtor’ under Chapter 13.” 549 U. S., at 372. And\n§1307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13\ncould be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding\n“for cause,” which the Court interpreted to authorize\ndismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct. In light of\n§1307(c), the Court held that the debtor’s bad faith could\nstop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13,\nthus preventing him from satisfying §706(d)’s express\ncondition on conversion. Id., at 372–373. That holding\nhas no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law\nfailed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his\nclaiming of the homestead exemption.\n   True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bank­\nruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case was authorized\nunder §105(a) and might have been authorized under the\ncourt’s inherent powers. Id., at 375–376. But even that\ndictum does not support Siegel’s position. In Marrama,\nthe Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to\nChapter 13, §1307(c) would have required it to be either\ndismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debt­\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor’s bad faith. Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the\nBankruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case had not\nbeen expressly authorized by §706(d), that action could\nhave been justified as a way of providing a “prompt, rather\nthan a delayed, ruling on [the debtor’s] unmeritorious at­\ntempt to qualify” under §1307(c). Id., at 376. At most,\nMarrama’s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a\nbankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with\nfutile procedural niceties in order to reach more expedi­\ntiously an end result required by the Code. Marrama\nmost certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view\nthat equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to\ncontravene express provisions of the Code.\n                             D\n   We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoul­\nder a heavy financial burden resulting from Law’s egre­\ngious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable\nresults for trustees and creditors in other cases. We have\nrecognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of\n§522, “Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemp­\ntion limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that\nexemptions visit on creditors.” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). The same can be said of the limits im­\nposed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.\nFor the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to\nalter the balance struck by the statute. Cf. Guidry v.\nSheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365,\n376–377 (1990).\n                        *     *     *\n   Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts\nof the essential “authority to respond to debtor misconduct\nwith meaningful sanctions.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17. There is ample authority to deny the\ndishonest debtor a discharge. See §727(a)(2)–(6). (That\n12                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition\nsettlement between Siegel and Law’s major creditor, Law\nhas no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be\nthe case.) In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro­\ncedure 9011—bankruptcy’s analogue to Civil Rule 11—\nauthorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith\nlitigation conduct, which may include “an order directing\npayment. . . of some or all of the reasonable attorneys’ fees\nand other expenses incurred as a direct result of the viola­\ntion.” Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2). The court may\nalso possess further sanctioning authority under either\n§105(a) or its inherent powers. Cf. Chambers, 501 U. S.,\nat 45–49. And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy\ncourt’s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case\nand is thereafter enforceable through the normal proce­\ndures for collecting money judgments. See §727(b). Fraud­\nulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor\nto criminal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. §152, which\ncarries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.\n   But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may\nimpose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene ex­\npress provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that\nthe debtor’s exempt property be used to pay debts and\nexpenses for which that property is not liable under the\nCode.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2655499, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/03/04/law_v._siegel.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

SIEGEL, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12–5196. Argued January 13, 2014—Decided March 4, 2014\nPetitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He valued his Califor-\n  nia home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was cov-\n  ered by California’s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from\n  the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U. S. C. §522(b)(3)(A). He also\n  claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens—one of which was in fa-\n  vor of “Lin’s Mortgage & Associates”—exceeded the home’s nonex-\n  empt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors. Re-\n  spondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the “Lin”\n  lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litiga-\n  tion ensued when a supposed “Lili Lin” in China claimed to be the\n  beneficiary of Law’s deed of trust. Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court\n  concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his\n  equity in the house. It thus granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge”\n  Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to\n  defray attorney’s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law’s fraudu-\n  lent misrepresentations. The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n  Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when\n it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s homestead exemption\n be made available to pay Siegel’s attorney’s fees. Pp. 5–12.\n     (a) A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to “carry out”\n the provisions of the Code, 11 U. S. C. §105(a), or its “inherent power\n . . . to sanction ‘abusive litigation practices,’ ” Marrama v. Citizens\n Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375–376, by taking action prohibited\n elsewhere in the Code. Here, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge”\n contravened §522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law\n to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate,\n §522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of\n2                              LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    any administrative expense,” §522(k), including attorney’s fees, see\n    §503(b)(2). The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court’s\n    authority under §105(a) and its inherent powers. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by\n    “surcharging” exempt property in response to a debtor’s misconduct\n    can coexist with §522. But insofar as that argument equates the sur-\n    charge with an outright denial of Law’s homestead exemption, it\n    founders on this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the home-\n    stead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.\n    And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge\n    an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644.\n    Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law’s entitle-\n    ment to the exemption, §522 specifies the criteria that render proper-\n    ty exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor’s invocation\n    of an exemption without a valid statutory basis. Federal courts may\n    apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law\n    itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemp-\n    tion on a ground not specified in the Code. Pp. 7–10.\n       (c) Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum\n    points toward a different result. There, the debtor’s bad faith kept\n    him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a\n    Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by §706(a). But that was be-\n    cause his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13,\n    and thus he could not satisfy §706(d), which expressly conditions\n    conversion on the debtor’s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.\n    Pp. 10–11.\n       (d) This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden\n    due to Law’s egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable re-\n    sults for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter\n    the balance that Congress struck in crafting §522.

It further\nprovides that exempt assets generally are not liable for\nany expenses associated with administering the estate. In\nthis case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court none­\ntheless may order that a debtor’s exempt assets be used to\npay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the\ndebtor’s misconduct.\n                                I. Background\n                              A\n  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent\ndebtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidat­\ning his assets to pay his creditors. 11 U. S. C. §§704(a)(1),\n726, 727. The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chap­\nter 7 creates a bankruptcy “estate” generally comprising\nall of the debtor’s property. §541(a)(1). The estate is\nplaced under the control of a trustee, who is responsible\nfor managing liquidation of the estate’s assets and distri­\nbution of the proceeds. §704(a)(1). The Code authorizes\n2                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debtor to “exempt,” however, certain kinds of property\nfrom the estate, enabling him to retain those assets post­\nbankruptcy. §522(b)(1). Except in particular situations\nspecified in the Code, exempt property “is not liable” for\nthe payment of “any [prepetition] debt” or “any adminis­\ntrative expense.” §522(c), (k).\n   Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemp­\ntions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.\n§522(b)(2), (d). One, commonly known as the “homestead\nexemption,” protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debt­\nor’s residence. §522(d)(1) and note following §522; see\nOwen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). The debtor may\nelect, however, to forgo the §522(d) exemptions and in­\nstead claim whatever exemptions are available under\napplicable state or local law. §522(b)(3)(A). Some States\nprovide homestead exemptions that are more generous\nthan the federal exemption; some provide less generous\nversions; but nearly every State provides some type of\nhomestead exemption. See López, State Homestead Ex­\nemptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To\nClose the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L. J. 143, 149–165\n(2010) (listing state exemptions).\n                             B\n  Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed\nto serve as trustee. The estate’s only significant asset was\nLaw’s house in Hacienda Heights, California. On a sched­\nule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the\nhouse at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value\nwas covered by California’s homestead exemption. See\nCal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §704.730(a)(1) (West Supp.\n2014). He also reported that the house was subject to two\nvoluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in\nfavor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and\ndeed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of “Lin’s Mortgage &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociates.” Law thus represented that there was no\nequity in the house that could be recovered for his other\ncreditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the\nhouse’s nonexempt value.\n   If Law’s representations had been accurate, he presum­\nably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel\nwould have had no reason to pursue its sale. Instead, a\nfew months after Law’s petition was filed, Siegel initiated\nan adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of\n“Lin’s Mortgage & Associates” was fraudulent. The deed\nof trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in\n1999 and reflected a debt to someone named “Lili Lin.”\nNot one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ulti­\nmately responded to Siegel’s complaint. One, Lili Lin of\nArtesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law’s\nwho denied ever having loaned him money and described\nhis repeated efforts to involve her in various sham trans­\nactions relating to the disputed deed of trust. That Lili\nLin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaim­\ning any interest in the house. But that was not the end of\nthe matter, because the second “Lili Lin” claimed to be the\ntrue beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust. Over the\nnext five years, this “Lili Lin” managed—despite suppos­\nedly living in China and speaking no English—to engage\nin extensive and costly litigation, including several ap­\npeals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and\nSiegel’s subsequent sale of the house.\n   Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order\nconcluding that “no person named Lili Lin ever made a\nloan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.”\nIn re Law, 401 B. R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.). The\ncourt found that “the loan was a fiction, meant to preserve\n[Law’s] equity in his residence beyond what he was enti­\ntled to exempt” by perpetrating “a fraud on his creditors\nand the court.” Ibid. With regard to the second “Lili Lin,”\nthe court declared itself “unpersuaded that Lili Lin of\n4                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChina signed or approved any declaration or pleading\npurporting to come from her.” Ibid. Rather, it said, the\n“most plausible conclusion” was that Law himself had\n“authored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.”\nIbid. It also found that Law had submitted false evidence\n“in an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China—\nrather than Lili Lin of Artesia—was the true holder of the\nlien on his residence.” Id., at 452. The court determined\nthat Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney’s\nfees overcoming Law’s fraudulent misrepresentations. It\ntherefore granted Siegel’s motion to “surcharge” the en­\ntirety of Law’s $75,000 homestead exemption, making\nthose funds available to defray Siegel’s attorney’s fees.\n   The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.\nBAP No. CC–09–1077–PaMkH, 2009 WL 7751415 (Oct.\n22, 2009) ( per curiam). It held that the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s factual findings regarding Law’s fraud were not\nclearly erroneous and that the court had not abused its\ndiscretion by surcharging Law’s exempt assets. It ex­\nplained that in Latman v. Burdette, 366 F. 3d 774 (2004),\nthe Ninth Circuit had recognized a bankruptcy court’s\npower to “equitably surcharge a debtor’s statutory ex­\nemptions” in exceptional circumstances, such as “when a\ndebtor engages in inequitable or fraudulent conduct.” 2009\nWL 7751415, *5, *7. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\nacknowledged that the Tenth Circuit had disagreed with\nLatman, see In re Scrivner, 535 F. 3d 1258, 1263–1265\n(2008), but the panel affirmed that Latman was correct.\n2009 WL 7751415, *7, n. 10.

But in exercising those statutory and inherent\npowers, a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific\nstatutory provisions.\n   It is hornbook law that §105(a) “does not allow the\nbankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other\nsections of the Bankruptcy Code.” 2 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶105.01[2], p. 105–6 (16th ed. 2013). Section 105(a) con­\nfers authority to “carry out” the provisions of the Code, but\nit is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the\nCode prohibits. That is simply an application of the axiom\nthat a statute’s general permission to take actions of a\ncertain type must yield to a specific prohibition found\nelsewhere. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550–551\n(1974); D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n206–208 (1932).1 Courts’ inherent sanctioning powers are\n——————\n  1 The second sentence of §105(a) adds little to the analysis. It states:\n\n“No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a\nparty in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,\nsua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary\nor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to\nprevent an abuse of process.” Even if the “abuse of process” language\nwere deemed to confer additional authority beyond that conferred by\nthe first sentence (which is doubtful), that general authority would also\nbe limited by more specific provisions of the Code.\n6                          LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlikewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and\nprohibitions. Degen v. United States, 517 U. S. 820, 823\n(1996); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991).\nWe have long held that “whatever equitable powers\nremain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be\nexercised within the confines of ” the Bankruptcy Code.\nNorwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197, 206\n(1988); see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530\nU. S. 15, 24–25 (2000); United States v. Noland, 517 U. S.\n535, 543 (1996); SEC v. United States Realty & Improve-\nment Co., 310 U. S. 434, 455 (1940).\n   Thus, the Bankruptcy Court’s “surcharge” was unau­\nthorized if it contravened a specific provision of the Code.\nWe conclude that it did. Section 522 (by reference to\nCalifornia law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity\nin his home from the bankruptcy estate. §522(b)(3)(A).\nAnd it made that $75,000 “not liable for payment of any\nadministrative expense.” §522(k).2 The reasonable attor­\nney’s fees Siegel incurred defeating the “Lili Lin” lien were\nindubitably an administrative expense, as a short march\nthrough a few statutory cross-references makes plain:\nSection 503(b)(2) provides that administrative expenses\ninclude “compensation . . . awarded under” §330(a);\n§330(a)(1) authorizes “reasonable compensation for actual,\nnecessary services rendered” by a “professional person\nemployed under” §327; and §327(a) authorizes the trustee\nto “employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist\nthe trustee in carrying out the trustee’s duties under this\ntitle.” Siegel argues that even though attorney’s fees\nincurred responding to a debtor’s fraud qualify as “admin­\nistrative expenses” for purposes of determining the trus­\n——————\n  2 The statute’s general rule that exempt assets are not liable for\n\nadministrative expenses is subject to two narrow exceptions, both per­\ntaining to the use of exempt assets to pay expenses associated with the\navoidance of certain voidable transfers of exempt property. §522(k)(1)–\n(2). Neither of those exceptions is relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntee’s right to reimbursement under §503(b), they do not so\nqualify for purposes of §522(k); but he gives us no reason\nto depart from the “ ‘normal rule of statutory construc­\ntion’ ” that words repeated in different parts of the same\nstatute generally have the same meaning. See Depart-\nment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n332, 342 (1994) (quoting Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury,\n475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986)).\n   The Bankruptcy Court thus violated §522’s express\nterms when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law’s\nhomestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel’s\nattorney’s fees, an administrative expense. In doing so,\nthe court exceeded the limits of its authority under §105(a)\nand its inherent powers.\n                             B\n   Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy\ncourt’s §105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised\nin contravention of the Code. Instead, his main argument\nis that the Bankruptcy Court’s surcharge did not contra­\nvene §522. That statute, Siegel contends, “establish[es]\nthe procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemp­\ntions” but “contains no directive requiring [courts] to allow\n[an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.” Brief for\nRespondent 35. Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable\npower in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by\n“surcharging” the exempt property in response to the\ndebtor’s misconduct can coexist comfortably with §522.\nThe United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees,\narguing that §522 “neither gives debtors an absolute right\nto retain exempt property nor limits a court’s authority to\nimpose an equitable surcharge on such property.” Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the\nBankruptcy Court’s surcharge with an outright denial of\nLaw’s homestead exemption, their arguments founder\n8                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nupon this case’s procedural history. The Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel stated that because no one “timely op­\npose[d] [Law]’s homestead exemption claim,” the exemp­\ntion “became final” before the Bankruptcy Court imposed\nthe surcharge. 2009 WL 7751415, at *2. We have held\nthat a trustee’s failure to make a timely objection prevents\nhim from challenging an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643–644 (1992).\n   But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have\nrevisited Law’s entitlement to the exemption, §522 does\nnot give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions\nbased on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.\nRather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that\nwill render property exempt. See §522(b), (d). Siegel\ninsists that because §522(b) says that the debtor “may\nexempt” certain property, rather than that he “shall be\nentitled” to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or\ndeny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.\nBut the subject of “may exempt” in §522(b) is the debtor,\nnot the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests\ndiscretion. A debtor need not invoke an exemption to\nwhich the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court\nmay not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid\nstatutory basis for doing so.\n   Moreover, §522 sets forth a number of carefully cali­\nbrated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to\nthe debtor’s misconduct. For example, §522(c) makes\nexempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition\ndebts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in\nconnection with student loans, and other specified types of\nwrongdoing. Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claim­\ning a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the\nhomestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10\nyears “with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a credi­\ntor.” And §522(q) caps a debtor’s homestead exemption at\napproximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en­\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntirely) where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that\nshows “that the filing of the case was an abuse of the\nprovisions of ” the Code, or where the debtor owes a debt\narising from specified wrongful acts—such as securities\nfraud, civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act, or “any criminal act, inten­\ntional tort, or willful or reckless misconduct that caused\nserious physical injury or death to another individual\nin the preceding 5 years.” §522(q) and note following\n§522. The Code’s meticulous—not to say mind-numbingly\ndetailed—enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to\nthose exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized\nto create additional exceptions. See Hillman v. Maretta,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28–29 (2001).\n   Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed\nauthority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from\namending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is\nmuch the same thing) based on the debtor’s fraudulent\nconcealment of the asset alleged to be exempt. See, e.g.,\nIn re Yonikus, 996 F. 2d 866, 872–873 (CA7 1993); In re\nDoan, 672 F. 2d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) ( per curiam); Stew-\nart v. Ganey, 116 F. 2d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940). He sug­\ngests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable\npower in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a\ndebtor’s bad-faith conduct. For the reasons we have given,\nthe Bankruptcy Code admits no such power. It is of course\ntrue that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption,\nthe exemption’s scope is determined by state law, which\nmay provide that certain types of debtor misconduct war­\nrant denial of the exemption. E.g., In re Sholdan, 217\nF. 3d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶522.08[1]–[2], at 522–45 to 522–47. Some of the early\ndecisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Cir­\ncuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts\napplied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.\n10                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee In re Denson, 195 F. 857, 858 (ND Ala. 1912); Cowan\nv. Burchfield, 180 F. 614, 619 (ND Ala. 1910); In re Ansley\nBros., 153 F. 983, 984 (EDNC 1907). But federal law\nprovides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an\nexemption on a ground not specified in the Code.\n                             C\n   Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which\nSiegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point\ntoward a different result. The question there was whether\na debtor’s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bank­\nruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor’s bankruptcy\nfrom a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization\nunder Chapter 13. Although §706(a) of the Code gave the\ndebtor a right to convert the case, §706(d) “expressly\nconditioned” that right on the debtor’s “ability to qualify as\na ‘debtor’ under Chapter 13.” 549 U. S., at 372. And\n§1307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13\ncould be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding\n“for cause,” which the Court interpreted to authorize\ndismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct. In light of\n§1307(c), the Court held that the debtor’s bad faith could\nstop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13,\nthus preventing him from satisfying §706(d)’s express\ncondition on conversion. Id., at 372–373. That holding\nhas no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law\nfailed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his\nclaiming of the homestead exemption.\n   True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bank­\nruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case was authorized\nunder §105(a) and might have been authorized under the\ncourt’s inherent powers. Id., at 375–376. But even that\ndictum does not support Siegel’s position. In Marrama,\nthe Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to\nChapter 13, §1307(c) would have required it to be either\ndismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debt­\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor’s bad faith. Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the\nBankruptcy Court’s refusal to convert the case had not\nbeen expressly authorized by §706(d), that action could\nhave been justified as a way of providing a “prompt, rather\nthan a delayed, ruling on [the debtor’s] unmeritorious at­\ntempt to qualify” under §1307(c). Id., at 376. At most,\nMarrama’s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a\nbankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with\nfutile procedural niceties in order to reach more expedi­\ntiously an end result required by the Code. Marrama\nmost certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view\nthat equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to\ncontravene express provisions of the Code.\n                             D\n   We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoul­\nder a heavy financial burden resulting from Law’s egre­\ngious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable\nresults for trustees and creditors in other cases. We have\nrecognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of\n§522, “Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemp­\ntion limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that\nexemptions visit on creditors.” Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). The same can be said of the limits im­\nposed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.\nFor the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to\nalter the balance struck by the statute. Cf. Guidry v.\nSheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365,\n376–377 (1990).\n                        *     *     *\n   Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts\nof the essential “authority to respond to debtor misconduct\nwith meaningful sanctions.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17. There is ample authority to deny the\ndishonest debtor a discharge. See §727(a)(2)–(6). (That\n12                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition\nsettlement between Siegel and Law’s major creditor, Law\nhas no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be\nthe case.) In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro­\ncedure 9011—bankruptcy’s analogue to Civil Rule 11—\nauthorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith\nlitigation conduct, which may include “an order directing\npayment. . . of some or all of the reasonable attorneys’ fees\nand other expenses incurred as a direct result of the viola­\ntion.” Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2). The court may\nalso possess further sanctioning authority under either\n§105(a) or its inherent powers. Cf. Chambers, 501 U. S.,\nat 45–49. And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy\ncourt’s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case\nand is thereafter enforceable through the normal proce­\ndures for collecting money judgments. See §727(b). Fraud­\nulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor\nto criminal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. §152, which\ncarries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.\n   But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may\nimpose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene ex­\npress provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that\nthe debtor’s exempt property be used to pay debts and\nexpenses for which that property is not liable under the\nCode.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2655499/", "sha1": "297f2383506e1549c4fdd4aee4f9b9f7d5e543c8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-025", "time_retrieved": "2014-03-04T14:55:22.236901"}
