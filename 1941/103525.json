He shouted to the engineer to push the brake valve over in emergency. The engineer turned and looked at him but did nothing to arrest the movement of the train. Petitioner jumped from his seat, crossed the cab, and stood behind the engineer for a brief time but said nothing. When the engine was but two or three car lengths from the standing train, the engineer applied the brakes. At that moment petitioner leaped from the engine and landed in some rocks along the track. He sustained serious injuries and to recover damages brought the instant action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 51&#8212;59, 45 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 51&#8212;59, against respondents in a Missouri circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint contained five counts charging negligence, but only the fourth was submitted to the jury. Count four alleged: '* * * that said engineer * * * was further negligent in that after he was notified by (petitioner) that the (train) was standing on said track near said crossing, he failed to immediately apply the air in the emergency, to stop said train, which negligence created a dilemma of imminent peril, which forced (petitioner) to jump from said train in order to save his life, or some bodily harm.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried before a jury which returned a verdict of $12,000.

It reversed the judgment but did not remand the cause for a new trial. 144 S.W.2d 76, 79.

Since the only count submitted to the jury charged that the engineer was negligent in failing to apply the brakes after notice of the train in front, petitioner was compelled also to prove that the notice was communicated to the engineer. But to establish the fact of communication petitioner had only to prove that the engineer &#167; ould have comprehended the warning under the circumstances disclosed. He was not obligated to go further and produce evidence of the subjective reactions in the engineer's mind.
